Topics/ Key Concepts
- Primitive vs Object value passing
    - pass by value (copied the value and allocated a new space)
    - pass by reference (refered to the same location)

- class for encapsulation
    - constructor
    - fields
    - methods
    - initiation
    - static
        - initiated with the class factory, only once
    - what is 'this' pointed to
        - class act as a single factory, process new instances
        - this pointed to the instance which is invoked
        - this can manipulate fileds and call methods

- OOP 
    - type system
    - inherit
        - parent
        - child
        - override
        - in java/c#/python, a class can only inherit one another class
    - inheritence
        - can mark methods as abstract to force the child to implement
        - child will inherit all the methods and fileds except for the constructor
        - child can use `super` keyword to call parent methods
        - abstract class
            - cannot construct an instance
    - interface (todo, will talk more later, like when to use interface rather than inheritence) 
        - provide interface to client by defining the capability
        - class which implemented the interface should impelement the interface specification
        - one class can implement multi interface
- ADT
    - abstraction oriented
        - specification
    - implementation
