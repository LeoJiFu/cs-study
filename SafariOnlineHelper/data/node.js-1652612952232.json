The purpose of\n\nthis lesson is to provide you with the basics of developing\n\napplications using the Node.js platform. The lesson first covers\n\nsetting up a development environment that enables you to build\n\nNode.js, MongoDB and AngularJS applications. Next, you learn how to\n\nbuild Node.js applications and modules. You also learn how Node.js\n\nimplements callbacks to provide a single threaded model for\n\napplications. Then you learn how to implement events in your\n\nNode.js applications. Finally, you learn how to use readable and\n\nwriteable streams to stream data to and from files.\n\n<br/><br/><b>Lesson 2: MongoDB Fundamentals</b><br/>Lesson 2 introduces you to the MongoDB database. The purpose\n\nof this lesson is to teach you how to use the MongoDB shell to\n\naccess and manage databases. You first learn how to access the\n\nMongoDB shell and execute commands. Then you learn how to use shell\n\ncommands to create databases, collections and documents. Next, you\n\nlearn how to view documents in a collection and then use shell\n\ncommands to modify and delete them. You also learn how to implement\n\nuser accounts and authentication to the MongoDB database. You then\n\nlearn about indexes and how to manage them. Finally, you learn how\n\nto build a MongoDB script that can be executed from a console\n\nprompt to access and manipulate documents. This exercise is very\n\nimportant because it builds a database that will be used in Lesson\n\n3.\n\n<br/><br/><b>Lesson 3: Using MongoDB as the Data Store for Node.js\n\nApplications</b><br/>Lesson 3 teaches you how to integrate the MongoDB database\n\ninto your Node.js applications. In this lesson, you learn how to\n\naccess a MongoDB server from your Node.js applications. You create\n\nsome queries that retrieve documents from a collection. Then you\n\nlearn how to limit the amount of data returned from the database.\n\nYou also learn how to sort the documents returned. Next, you use\n\nthe MongoDB aggregation pipeline to aggregate data before\n\nretrieving it from the server. Finally, you learn how to add,\n\nremove and update documents in a collection.\n\n<br/><b>Lesson 4: Using Express as the Node.js Web Server</b><br/><br/>Lesson 4 dives into using the Node.js module Express to\n\nimplement web servers. You learn how to start the server, handle\n\nvarious types of routes and serve static files. Next, you learn how\n\nto handle parameters in a query. Then you get a chance to implement\n\ntemplates and a template engine to deliver dynamic content. You\n\nalso learn how to handle JSON data in both requests and responses.\n\nFinally, you learn how to implement and manage sessions to store\n\ndata between client requests.\n\n<br/><br/><b>Lesson 5: AngularJS Framework Fundamentals</b><br/>Lesson 5 introduces you to using the AngularJS platform to\n\nextend HTML and build client applications. The lesson begins by\n\nhelping you create your first AngularJS application. Then you learn\n\nhow to bind data from the model to HTML elements. You also learn\n\nhow to build your own custom directives. Next, you learn how to use\n\nthe built-in directives to extend HTML. You then learn how to use\n\nthe AngularJS http service to communicate with the server via AJAX.\n\nFinally, you learn how to build your own custom services that can\n\nbe re-used in your AngularJS applications.\n\n<br/><br/><b>Lesson 6: Implementing the Full Node.js, MongoDB, and AngularJS\n\nStack to Add User Authentication to a Web Site</b><br/>Lesson 6 combines the concepts from all the previous lessons\n\ntogether to build a Node.js, MongoDB, and AngularJS solution that\n\nprovides user accounts and authentication to a web site. In the\n\nfirst step, you build the application server, routes and views.\n\nNext, you add session support to the server to store authentication\n\nstate between requests. Then you build the server-side component to\n\nstore and retrieve user data in the MongoDB database. Finally, you\n\nimplement the necessary AngularJS components to handle interaction\n\nwith the server to update the user data.\n\n<br/><br/><b>Lesson 7: Implementing the Full Node.js, MongoDB, and AngularJS\n\nStack to Provide a Dynamic View of Backend Data</b><br/>In Lesson 7, you use the full Node.js, MongoDB, and AngularJS\n\nstack to access and display data from the MongoDB database in a\n\ndynamic view. You begin by creating a dynamic HTML table that is\n\nbound to data from the MongoDB database. Then you add the\n\ncapability to page through entries in the collection. Next, you add\n\nthe capability to filter data in the application. Finally, you add\n\na sort feature to sort the document based on different field\n\nvalues.\n\n<br/><br/><b>About LiveLessons</b><br/>The LiveLessons Video Training series publishes hundreds of\n\nhands-on, expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of\n\ntechnology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to\n\nsucceed.

It allows you to create efficient code, enabling a more sustainable way of writing software made of only one language across the full stack, along with extreme levels of reusability, pragmatism, simplicity, and collaboration. Node.js is revolutionizing the web and the way people and companies create their software.</p><p>In this book, we will take you on a journey across various ideas and components, and the challenges you would commonly encounter while designing and developing software using the Node.js platform. You will also discover the \"Node.js way\" of dealing with design and coding decisions.</p><p>The book kicks off by exploring the basics of Node.js describing it's asynchronous single-threaded architecture and the main design patterns. It then shows you how to master the asynchronous control flow patterns,and the stream component and it culminates into a detailed list of Node.js implementations of the most common design patterns as well as some specific design patterns that are exclusive to the Node.js world.Lastly, it dives into more advanced concepts such as Universal Javascript, and scalability' and it's meant to conclude the journey by giving the reader all the necessary concepts to be able to build an enterprise grade application using Node.js.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This book takes its intended readers through a comprehensive explanation to create a scalable and efficient real-time server-side apps.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book.

    "description": "<span><p>Node.js. It’s the latest in a long line of “Are you cool enough to use me?” programming languages, APIs, and toolkits. In that sense, it lands squarely in the tradition of Rails, and Ajax, and Hadoop, and even to some degree iPhone programming and HTML5.<br/><br/>Dig a little deeper, and you’ll hear that Node.js (or, as it’s more briefly called by many, simply “Node”) is a server-side solution for JavaScript, and in particular, for receiving and responding to HTTP requests. If that doesn’t completely boggle your mind, by the time the conversation heats up with discussion of ports, sockets, and threads, you’ll tend to glaze over. Is this really JavaScript? In fact, why in the world would anyone want to run JavaScript outside of a browser, let alone the server?<br/><br/>The good news is that you’re hearing (and thinking) about the right things. Node really is concerned with network programming and server-side request/response processing. The bad news is that like Rails, Ajax, and Hadoop before it, there’s precious little clear information available. There will be, in time — as there now is for these other “cool” frameworks that have matured — but why wait for a book or tutorial when you might be able to use Node today, and dramatically improve the maintainability.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>Traditionally, web applications have been architected so that\nthe back-end houses all the front-end code. This has resulted in\nheavy projects that are difficult to manage and scale. This book\nwill explain a new way to write web applications by treating the\nfront-end as if it were a third-party (such as a mobile client).\nThis book, written by a practicing MEAN developer, will take a\nholistic approach to using the MEAN JavaScript platform for\ncreating modern web applications and lay out how to use the MEAN\n(Mongo, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js) set of tools to create a\nweb application, from installation and setup of the tools to\ndebugging and deploying your app. After an introduction to how web\ndevelopment is changing and the advantages of using the MEAN stack,\nthe author jumps into an introduction to each tool and then dives\ninto using the complete JavaScript-based application stack to\nbuild, test, and deploy apps.<br/>\n<br/></p></span></span>",

One way to do that is to let developers write custom code that will run on your servers. However, doing so brings a lot of problems. You don’t want your users to be able to kill your server or access other users’ information. These are the problems Auth0 faced and the reason why it created the sandbox.

    "description": "<span><p><b>Get the best out of Node.js by mastering a series of patterns and techniques to create modular, scalable, and efficient applications</b></p><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Node.js is a massively popular software platform that lets you use JavaScript to easily create scalable server-side applications. It allows you to create efficient code, enabling a more sustainable way of writing software made of only one language across the full stack, along with extreme levels of reusability, pragmatism, simplicity, and collaboration. Node.js is revolutionizing the web and the way people and companies create their software.</p><p>In this book, we will take you on a journey across various ideas and components, and the challenges you would commonly encounter while designing and developing software using the Node.js platform. You will also discover the \"Node.js way\" of dealing with design and coding decisions.</p><p>The book kicks off by exploring the fundamental principles and components that define the platform. It then shows you how to master asynchronous programming and how to design elegant and reusable components using well-known patterns and techniques. The book rounds off by teaching you the various approaches to scale, distribute, and integrate your Node.js application.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Design and implement a series of server-side JavaScript patterns so you understand why and when to apply them in different use case scenarios</li><li>Understand the fundamental Node.js components and use them to their full potential</li><li>Untangle your modules by organizing and connecting them coherently</li><li>Reuse well-known solutions to circumvent common design and coding issues</li><li>Deal with asynchronous code with comfort and ease</li><li>Identify and prevent common problems, programming errors, and anti-patterns</li></ul><p>Downloading the example code for this book.

Project 1 - Vidjot An application where content creators can register and jot down and manage ideas for future videos.The first project is quite simple as it is meant to be an introduction where the author explains everything about Express routing, middleware, templates, Mongoose, and so on. We implement Passport and a local strategy where we store emails as usernames and encrypted passwords in our database. We will prepare and deploy this app to Heroku and add a domain name. Project 2 - Storybooks: A much more sophisticated project. A social network for creating public and private stories. This app uses a Google OAuth 2.0 strategy for authentication. Users can login and create stories which can be set to public or private. They can also choose if comments are allowed to be posted. We will create a dashboard for users to manage their stories. We will create helpers for authentication and access control as well as handlebars template helpers. We will prepare and deploy this app to Heroku and add a domain name.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this course: You can download the example code files for all Packt video courses you have purchased from your account at <a href=\"http://www.PacktPub.com\">http://www.PacktPub.com</a>.

Build tools, package managers, loaders, bundlers, linters, compilers, transpilers, typecheckers - how do you make sense of it all?\n</p><p>In this book, we will build a simple API and React application from scratch. We begin by setting up our development environment using Git, yarn, Babel, and ESLint. Then, we will use Express, Elasticsearch and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to build a stateless API service. For the front-end, we will use React, Redux, and Webpack.\n</p><p>A central theme in the book is maintaining code quality. As such, we will enforce a Test-Driven Development (TDD) process using Selenium, Cucumber, Mocha, Sinon, and Istanbul. As we progress through the book, the focus will shift towards automation and infrastructure. You will learn to work with Continuous Integration (CI) servers like Jenkins, deploying services inside Docker containers, and run them on Kubernetes.\n</p><p>By following this book, you would gain the skills needed to build robust, production-ready applications.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Practice Test-Driven Development (TDD) throughout the entire book\n</li><li>Use Cucumber, Mocha and Selenium to write E2E, integration, unit and UI tests\n</li><li>Build stateless APIs using Express and Elasticsearch\n</li><li>Document your API using OpenAPI and Swagger\n</li><li>Build and bundle front-end applications using React, Redux and Webpack\n</li><li>Containerize services using Docker\n</li><li>Deploying scalable microservices using Kubernetes</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>If you're a JavaScript developer looking to expand your skillset and become a senior JavaScript developer by building production-ready web applications, then this book is for you.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book You can download the example code files for all Packt books you have purchased from your account at http://www.PacktPub.com.

Some knowledge of REST would be an added advantage, but is definitely not a necessity.</p><b>What You Will Learn</b><ul><li>Install, develop, and test your own Node.js user modules</li><li>Understand the differences between HTTP and RESTful applications</li><li>Use self-descriptive URLs and set accurate HTTP status codes</li><li>Eliminate third-party dependencies in your tests with mocking</li><li>Implement automation tests for a REST-enabled endpoint with Mocha</li><li>Secure your services with NoSQL database integration within Node.js applications</li><li>Integrate a simple frontend using JavaScript libraries available on a CDN server</li></ul><b>In Detail</b><p>When building RESTful services, it is really important to choose the right framework. Node.js, with its asynchronous, event-driven architecture, is exactly the right choice for building RESTful APIs.</p><p>This third edition of RESTful Web API Design with Node.js 10 will teach you to create scalable and rich RESTful applications based on the Node.js platform. You will be introduced to the latest NPM package handler and understand how to use it to customize your RESTful development process. You will begin by understanding the key principle that makes an HTTP application a RESTful-enabled application. After writing a simple HTTP request handler, you will create and test Node.js modules using automated tests and mock objects; explore using the NoSQL database, MongoDB, to store data; and get to grips with using self-descriptive URLs. You'll learn to set accurate HTTP status codes along with understanding how to keep your applications backward-compatible. Also, while implementing a full-fledged RESTful service, you will use Swagger to document the API and implement automation tests for a REST-enabled endpoint with Mocha. Lastly, you will explore some authentication techniques to secure your application.</p><b>Style and approach</b><p>Step-by-step practical guide to building RESTful applications</p></span>",

Since JavaScript is the language of the web, building APIs using Node.js provides a seamless development experience on both the front end and the back end.</p><p>This video course gives you an overview of a RESTful API and goes through the logical steps of building one. It explores three different APIs, focusing on their similarities and differences to effectively implement one.</p><p>We’ll start off by defining APIs, showing how they can be built on top of HTTP, and listing the properties that make an API RESTful. We will develop Twitter Notes, a web application that lets its users leave notes for their Twitter friends. We will use Twitter’s API to implement a login flow and then design a web API. In addition to using Twitter’s API, we will take a closer look at two other real-world APIs—Facebook API and GitHub API. Finally, we’ll end up honing some best practices to keep the APIs secure, maintainable, and performant.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will have a good grasp of APIs, HTTP, REST, OAuth 1.0a, API testing, and API security. Since the course explores three different REST APIs, you will reach a level where you will be comfortable using any RESTful API, even if it does not have an SDK.</p></span></span>",

You’ll also understand how Docker can be used to run the apps you build in a clear and well-defined way, all of which will be able to springboard you into creating more advanced apps on your own.<p></p>\n<p><b>What You'll Learn</b></p>\n<p></p><ul><li>Get a project started and logically structure it<br/></li><li>Construct a user interface with React and Material-UI </li><li>Use WebSockets for real-time communication between client and server<br/></li><li>Build a REST API with Node and Express as another approach to client-server communication</li><li>Package the app with Webpack for optimized delivery</li><li>Take a completed app and wrap it up with Docker for easy distribution</li><li>Review a host of other ancillary topics including NPM, Semantic versioning, Babel, NoSQL, and more</li></ul><p></p>\n<p><b>Who This Book Is For</b><br/></p>\n<p>Web developers with basic knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and CLI tools who are interested in and in all aspects of application development, and using TypeScript instead of straight JavaScript.  </p></div></span>",

This updated fifth edition of Node.js Web Development focuses on the new features of Node.js 14, Express 4.x, and ECMAScript, taking you through modern concepts, techniques, and best practices for using Node.js.</p><p>The book starts by helping you get to grips with the concepts of building server-side web apps with Node.js. You'll learn how to develop a complete Node.js web app, with a backend database tier to help you explore several databases. You'll deploy the app to real web servers, including a cloud hosting platform built on AWS EC2 using Terraform and Docker Swarm, while integrating other tools such as Redis and NGINX. As you advance, you'll learn about unit and functional testing, along with deploying test infrastructure using Docker. Finally, you'll discover how to harden Node.js app security, use Let's Encrypt to provision the HTTPS service, and implement several forms of app security with the help of expert practices. With each chapter, the book will help you put your knowledge into practice throughout the entire life cycle of developing a web app.</p><p>By the end of this Node.js book, you'll have gained practical Node.js web development knowledge and be able to build and deploy your own apps on a public web hosting solution.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Install and use Node.js 14 and Express 4.17 for both web development and deployment</li><li>Implement RESTful web services using the Restify framework</li><li>Develop, test, and deploy microservices using Docker, Docker Swarm, and Node.js, on AWS EC2 using Terraform</li><li>Get up to speed with using data storage engines such as MySQL, SQLite3, and MongoDB</li><li>Test your web applications using unit testing with Mocha, and headless browser testing with Puppeteer</li><li>Implement HTTPS using Let's Encrypt and enhance application security with Helmet</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>If you're looking for an alternative to the 'P' languages (Perl, PHP, and Python), or if you want to get started with server-side web development with JavaScript programming, or if you want a deep dive into deploying services to cloud hosting, this Node.js book is for you. A rudimentary understanding of JavaScript and web application development is a must before you get started with this book.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>While there have been quite a few attempts to get JavaScript working as a server-side language, Node.js (frequently just called Node) has been the first environment that's gained any traction. It's now used by companies such as Netflix, Uber and Paypal to power their web apps. Node allows for blazingly fast performance; thanks to its event loop model, common tasks like network connection and database I/O can be executed very quickly indeed.</p><p>In this book, we offer a selection of nine different practical projects that you can follow along with.</p><p>It contains:</p><ul><li><em>Build a Simple Beginner App with Node, Bootstrap &amp; MongoDB</em> by James Hibbard</li><li><em>How to Build a File Upload Form with Express and Dropzone.js</em> by Lukas White</li><li><em>How to Build and Structure a Node.js MVC Application</em> by James Kolce</li><li><em>User Authentication with the MEAN Stack</em> by Simon Holmes &amp; Jeremy Wilken</li><li><em>Build a JavaScript Command Line Interface (CLI) with Node.js</em> by Lukas White &amp; Michael Wanyoike</li><li><em>Building a Real-time Chat App with Sails.js</em> by Michael Wanyoike</li><li><em>Passport Authentication for Node.js Applications</em> by Paul Orac</li><li><em>Local Authentication Using Passport in Node.js</em> by Paul Orac</li><li><em>An Introduction to NodeBots</em> by Patrick Catanzariti</li></ul><p>This book is for anyone who wants to start learning server-side development with Node.js.

Node.js, with its asynchronous, event-driven architecture, is exactly the right choice to build RESTful APIs.</p><p>This book will help you enrich your development skills to create scalable, server-side, RESTful applications based on the Node.js platform.</p><p>Starting with the fundamentals of REST, you will understand why RESTful web services are better data provisioning solution than other technologies. You will start setting up a development environment by installing Node.js, Express.js, and other modules. Next, you will write a simple HTTP request handler and create and test Node.js modules using automated tests and mock objects. You will then have to choose the most appropriate data storage type, having options between a key/value or document data store, and also you will implement automated tests for it. This module will evolve chapter by chapter until it turns into a full-fledged and secure Restful service.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>Create state of the art RESTful API solutions leveraging Node.JS 4.x.</p></span>",

It's now used by companies such as Netflix, Uber and Paypal to power their web apps. Node allows for blazingly fast performance; thanks to its event loop model, common tasks like network connection and database I/O can be executed very quickly indeed.</p><p>From a beginner's point of view, one of Node's obvious advantages is that it uses JavaScript, a ubiquitous language that many developers are comfortable with. If you can write JavaScript for the client-side, writing server-side applications with Node should not be too much of a stretch for you.</p><p>In this book, we'll offer a beginner's introduction to Node and its related technologies, and get you under way writing your first Node applications.</p><p>It contains:</p><ul><li><em>What Is Node and When Should I Use It?</em> by James Hibbard</li><li><em> A Beginner Splurge in Node.js</em> by Camilo Reyes and Michiel Mulders</li><li><em>A Beginner's Guide to npm- the Node Package Manager</em> by Michael Wanyoike and Peter Dierx</li><li><em>Forms, File Uploads and Security with Node.js and Express</em> by Mark Brown</li><li><em>MEAN Stack: Build an App with Angular 2+ and the Angular CLI</em> by Manjunath M</li><li><em>Debugging JavaScript with the Node Debugger</em> by Camilo Reyes</li><li><em>Using MySQL with Node.js and the mysql JavaScript Client</em> by Jay Raj</li><li><em>How to Use SSL/TLS with Node.js</em> by Florian Rappl and Almir Bijedic</li></ul><p>This book is for anyone who wants to start learning server-side development with Node.js.

    "description": "<span><strong>6+ Hours of Video Instruction</strong><br/><br/>\n\nLearn to write performant back-end applications in JavaScript by leveraging the Node.js runtime. Shaun Wassell teaches JavaScript developers how to write and run server-side JavaScript applications for the powerful Node.js runtime. It includes topics such as working with the file system, creating web servers, installing, using, and publishing NPM packages, Google V8 engine, testing, and much more.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Description</strong>\n<br/>\n\nSeveral years ago, it wasn’t possible to write JavaScript programs for the back-end. JavaScript was strictly limited to running in a browser, and if a developer wanted to write back-end software, they had little choice but to learn another programming language, such as PHP. Now, that has all changed. Thanks to Node.js, which allows JavaScript to be run outside the browser, JavaScript developers can write web-servers, server-side scripts, and any number of other useful back-end programs.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nThis LiveLessons video shows developers how to write and run server-side JavaScript applications for the powerful Node.js runtime.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nThe code repository for this LiveLesson can be accessed at <a href=\"https://github.com/shaunwa/node-course\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/shaunwa/node-course</a>.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>About the Instructor</strong>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Shaun Wassell</strong>'s goal is to create a world where people are empowered to use programming as a way to solve meaningful problems--a world where writing code is just as natural for most people as walking or breathing. To help make this a reality, he has dedicated the past few years to helping people learn and master software development skills through video courses, live training sessions, and one-on-one tutoring. Shaun has been programming since he was a kid, when creating video games was his gateway into the world of software. Since then, he's been fortunate enough to be a contributing member on many amazing software projects and work with some incredible mentors along the way.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Skill Level</strong>\n<ul><li>Intermediate</li></ul>\n<strong>What You Will Learn</strong>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nLearn to quickly and easily write performant back-end applications in JavaScript by leveraging the Node.js runtime:\n\n<ul><li>Write useful server-side programs using modern JavaScript</li><li>Build Node.js web servers using several different frameworks</li><li>Deploy your Node.js applications so that they can be accessed from anywhere</li><li>Create and publish an open-source NPM package</li></ul>\n\nShaun also covers more advanced features for developers, such as:\n\n<ul><li>Maximizing the performance of your Node.js programs by learning about how Nodes V8 runtime works</li><li>Interfacing with databases in Node</li></ul>\n<strong>Who Should Take This Course?</strong>\n<ul><li>Front-end developers/engineers</li><li>Full-stack developers/engineers</li><li>Back-end developers/engineers</li><li>JavaScript developers/engineers</li></ul>\n<strong>Course Requirements</strong>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n<ul><li>Working knowledge of JavaScript.</li><li>Some experience working on either the front- or back-end of a web application, but this is not a requirement.</li></ul>\n<strong>About Pearson Video Training</strong>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nPearson publishes expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

    "description": "<span><p>Build enterprise-grade microservices in the SAP HANA Advanced Model (XSA). This book explains building scalable APIs in XSA and the benefits of building microservices with SAP HANA XSA.</p><p>This book covers the cloud foundry (CF) architecture and how SAP HANA XSA follows the model. It begins with the details of the different architectural layers of applications hosted in XSA (specifically, microservices). Everything you need to know is presented, including analyzing requests, modularization, database ingestion, building JSON responses, and scaling your microservices. You will learn to use developmental tools such as the SAP WEB IDE, POSTMAN, and the SAP HANA Cockpit for XSA, including debugging examples on SAP HANA XSA with code snippets showing how microservices can be developed, debugged, scaled, and deployed on SAP HANA XSA. Microservices are divided into security and authentication, request handling, modularization of Node.js, and interaction with the SAP HANA database containers and response formatting. An end-to-end scenario is presented of a Node.js REST API that uses HTTP methods, concluding with deploying an SAP HANA XSA project to a production environment.</p><p></p><p>This book is simple enough to help you implement a Node.js module in order to understand the development of microservices, and complex enough for architects to design their next business-ready solution integrating UAA security, application modularization, and an end-to-end REST API on SAP HANA XSA.</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><p></p><ul><li>Know the definition and architecture of cloud foundry and its application on SAP HANA XSA</li><li>Understand REST principles and different HTTP methods</li><li>Explore microservices (Node.js) development</li><li>Database interaction from Node (executing SQL statements and stored procedures)</li></ul><p></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b><br/></p><p>Architects designing business-ready solutions that integrate UAA security, application modularization, and an end-to-end REST API on SAP HANA XSA<br/></p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><span><p/><p><em>Beginning Amazon Web Services with Node.js</em> teaches any novice Node.js developer to configure, deploy, and maintain scalable small to large scale Node.js applications in Amazon Web Services. Hosting a Node.js application in a production environment usually means turning to PaaS hosting, but this approach brings problems. Deploying Node.js directly to AWS solves the problems you encounter in these situations, enabling you to cut out the middle man.</p><p>You will begin with a basic RESTful web service in Node.js, using the popular Express.js framework, pre-built and ready to run in your local environment. You will be introduced to the most powerful tools in AWS, and learn how to configure your project to take advantage of them. You will be guided through the steps of getting the various key components to work together on AWS. Through code samples using the AWS JavaScript SDK and tutorials in the AWS console, you will gain the knowledge to incorporate secure user authentication, server auto-scaling, a load balancer, CDN, customized caching behavior, and outage monitoring.</p><p>Node.js is single-threaded, and designed to run high input / high output applications, making it ideal for the cloud environment. If your main task is handling a high volume of requests over HTTP / the web, it will scale very well in proportion to the computing power you allocate to it. Amazon Web Services offers a broad set of services that help organizations move faster, lower costs, and scale applications. Trusted by the largest enterprises and start-ups alike, AWS powers a wide variety of workloads across a broad spectrum. If leveraged properly, you can build a Node.js app on AWS which can automatically power itself up to handle a massive volume of traffic, and then scale back down to a lighter configuration when user demand has dropped. Amazon Web Services offers a broad set of services that help organizations move faster, lower costs, and scale applications. Get started with Node.js and AWS using this book today. </p></span></span></span></span>",

Since it's hard to simulate on a foreign platform, packaging and distribution can be quite platform-specific and testing cross-platform apps is pretty complicated.In such scenarios, web technologies such as HTML5 and JavaScript can be your lifesaver. HTML5 desktop applications can be distributed across different platforms (Window, MacOS, and Linux) without any modifications to the code.</p><p>The book starts with a walk-through on building a simple file explorer from scratch powered by NW.JS. So you will practice the most exciting features of bleeding edge CSS and JavaScript. In addition you will learn to use the desktop environment integration API, source code protection, packaging, and auto-updating with NW.JS.</p><p>As the second application you will build a chat-system example implemented with Electron and React. While developing the chat app, you will get Photonkit. Next, you will create a screen capturer with NW.JS, React, and Redux.</p><p>Finally, you will examine an RSS-reader built with TypeScript, React, Redux, and Electron. Generic UI components will be reused from the React MDL library. By the end of the book, you will have built four desktop apps. You will have covered everything from planning, designing, and development to the enhancement, testing, and delivery of these apps.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>Filled with real world examples, this book teaches you to build cross-platform desktop apps right from scratch using a step-by-step approach.</p></span>",

Signal integrity can no longer be addressed solely through improvements in package or board-level design: Diverse engineering teams must work together closely from the earliest design stages to identify the best system-level solutions. In High-Speed Signaling, several of the field’s most respected practitioners and researchers introduce cutting-edge modeling, simulation, and optimization techniques for meeting this challenge.</p><p>Edited by pioneering experts Drs. Dan Oh and Chuck Yuan, these contributors explain why noise and jitter are no longer separable, demonstrate how to model their increasingly complex interactions, and thoroughly introduce a new simulation methodology for predicting link-level performance with unprecedented accuracy.</p><p>The authors address signal integrity from architecture through high-volume production, thoroughly discussing design, implementation, and verification. Coverage includes</p><ul><li><p>New advances in passive-channel modeling, power-supply noise and jitter modeling, and system margin prediction</p></li><li><p>Methodologies for balancing system voltage and timing budgets to improve system robustness in high-volume manufacturing</p></li><li><p>Practical, stable formulae for converting key network parameters</p></li><li><p>Improved solutions for difficult problems in the broadband modeling of interconnects</p></li><li><p>Equalization techniques for optimizing channel performance</p></li><li><p>Important new insights into the relationships between jitter and clocking topologies</p></li><li><p>New on-chip measurement techniques for in-situ link performance testing</p></li><li><p>Trends and future directions in signal integrity engineering</p></li></ul><p><em>High-Speed Signaling</em> thoroughly introduces new techniques pioneered at Rambus and other leading high-tech companies and universities: approaches that have never before been presented with this much practical detail. It will be invaluable to everyone concerned with signal integrity, including signal and power integrity engineers, high-speed I/O circuit designers, and system-level board design engineers.</p></div></span>",

    "description": "<span>\n    \"We had no vehicle. We didn't know how or if we could continue heading south. I was in a vast, seemingly endless desert. I didn't know when or if we'd make it to the other side. I didn't even know where the other side was. It wasn't in Algeria. I knew that much. Was it in Niger? Where does the Sahara actually end?\"<br/>We live in a culture, Donahue writes, which loves \"climbing mountains.\" We want to see the peak, map out a route, and follow it to the top. Sometimes this approach works, but not always, particularly when we are enduring a personal crisis-divorce, job loss, addiction, illness, or death. We may not know exactly where we are going, how to get there, or even how we'll know we've arrived.<br/>And it's not just in times of crisis. There are many deserts in our lives, situations with no clear paths or boundaries. Finding a job is usually a mountain, but changing careers can be a desert. Having a baby is a mountain, especially for the mom. But raising a child is a desert. Battling cancer is a mountain. Living with a chronic illness is a desert.<br/>In the desert, we need to follow different rules than we follow when conquering a mountain. We need to be more intuitive, more patient, more spontaneous. Donahue outlines six \"rules of desert travel\" that will help us discover our direction by wandering, find our own personal oases, and cross our self-imposed borders.<br/>\"The sun appears like a silent explosion, a slow motion fireworks display dazzling the volcanic crags of the Hoggar. I stand up and walk to the path and begin descending to Klaus' car. I've made my decision. Tallis and I will travel, somehow, to Agadez. I don't have a logical explanation for my decision or a plan to get to the last oasis. I know I am on the right journey-I am following my compass.\"<br/>Shifting Sands shows us how to slow down, reflect, and embrace the changes of life graciously, naturally, and courageously.\n  </span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p>Today, the availability of bright and highly coherent electron sources and sensitive detectors has radically changed the type and quality of the information which can be obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEMs are now present in large numbers not only in academia, but also in industrial research centers and fabs.</p><p>This book presents in a simple and practical way the new quantitative techniques based on TEM which have recently been invented or developed to address most of the main challenging issues scientists and process engineers have to face to develop or optimize semiconductor layers and devices. Several of these techniques are based on electron holography; others take advantage of the possibility of focusing intense beams within nanoprobes. Strain measurements and mappings, dopant activation and segregation, interfacial reactions at the nanoscale, defect identification and specimen preparation by FIB are among the topics presented in this book. After a brief presentation of the underlying theory, each technique is illustrated through examples from the lab or fab.</p></span></span></span>",

In this O’Reilly report, he dissects some of his most memorable blunders, peeling them back layer-by-layer to reveal just what went wrong.</p><p>For example, you could install every third-party package that looks interesting and end up with a tangled mess where nothing works right. Or you could write a test that manages to break the build. Mike’s done both and so much more.

Author Azat Mardan clearly explains how to start developing with Express.js with a basic 'Hello World', and then delves into a deep API reference, before looking at common and abstract development problems. Lastly, you will learn how to build a series of real-world apps in order to cement your knowledge.</p><em/><p>In order to get the best from this book, you will be familiar with Node.js scripts and able to install packages using npm. In the deep API reference, each aspect of the Express.js API is explained clearly with a simple exercise to demonstrate its usage. This includes configuration, settings and environments; different middleware and its uses; templating engines; extracting parameters and routing; request and response; error handling; and running an app. In the next part you'll delve into abstraction, streams, authentication, multithreading, Socket.io, security, and more complex modules. You will also learn about smaller frameworks built using Express.js, such as Sails.js, and Derby. Finally you'll build real-world apps including a REST API, Todo App, and Instagram gallery. </p><p>Express.js is used by a range of well-known companies such as MySpace and Storify, and it's becoming more and more likely that it'll be a required skill for new developers.

Like an audiobook that you can also watch as a video.</h5><br/> <i>\"Looking to go full stack? Getting MEAN will take you there.\"</i><br/>\nMatt Merkes, MyNeighbor<br/><br/>\n<p><b>Getting MEAN</b> teaches you how to develop web applications using the MEAN stack. First, you'll create the skeleton of a static site in Express and Node, and then push it up to a live web server. Next, add a MongoDB database and build an API before using Angular to handle data manipulation and application logic in the browser. Finally you'll add an authentication system to the application, using the whole stack. When you finish, you'll have all the skills you need to build a dynamic data-driven web application.<br/>\n</p><p>Traditional web dev stacks use a different programming language in every layer, resulting in a complex mashup of code and frameworks. Together, the MongoDB database, the Express and AngularJS frameworks, and Node.js constitute the MEAN stack - a powerful platform that uses only one language, top to bottom: JavaScript. Developers and businesses love it because it's scalable and cost-effective. End users love it because the apps created with it are fast and responsive. It's a win-win-win!</p>\nInside:\n<ul><li>Full-stack development using JavaScript\n</li><li>Responsive web techniques\n</li><li>Everything you need to get started with MEAN\n</li><li>Best practices for efficiency and reusability\n</li></ul>\nLearners should have some web development experience. This book/course is based on MongoDB 2, Express 4, Angular 1, and Node.js 4.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Simon Holmes</b> has been a full-stack developer since the late 1990s and runs Full Stack Training Ltd. \n<br/><br/>\n<i>Fantastic explanations and up-to-date, real-world examples.</i><br/>\nRambabu Posa, LGL Assessment<br/><br/>\n<i>From novice to experienced developer, all who want to use the MEAN stack will get useful advice here.</i><br/>\nDavide Molin, CodingShack.com<br/><br/>\n<i>A ground-up explanation of MEAN stack layers.</i><br/>\nAndrea Tarocchi, Red Hat<br/><br/>\nNARRATED BY CHRIS DUNN</span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Used in laptop and desktop computers, low-end servers, and mobile devices, Serial ATA (Advance Technology Attachment), or SATA, is the pervasive disk storage technology in use today. SATA has also penetrated the enterprise computing environment by adding hardware components for fail-over, extending command processing capabilities, and increasing device performance and link speeds. If you work in a data center or manage your company’s storage resources, you will likely encounter storage solutions that require SATA software or hardware.</p><p>In this book, leading storage networking technologist David Deming presents a comprehensive guide to designing, analyzing, and troubleshooting any SATA or SATA Express (SATAe) storage solution. Written by an engineer, this book is for those who aren't afraid of digging into the technical details. It explains how SATA/SATAe powers data center applications and how it influences and interacts with all protocol layers and system components. </p><p>This book covers all of the tasks associated with installing, configuring, and managing SATA/SATAe storage applications. If you are a test engineer, design engineer, system architect, or even a technically skilled gamer who likes to build your own systems, this book will answer your technical questions about SATA/SATAe. With this book, you should have everything you need to implement a SATA or SATAe storage solution.</p></span>",

Five new chapters on unit operations have been added, the revenues and costs chapter has been substantially revised and updated, and the references have been brought fully up to date. In addition, the pack now also includes a fully working version of the MicroMODEL mine planning software package.</p><p>Volume 1 deals with the fundamental concepts involved in the planning and design of open pit mines. Subjects covered are mine planning, mining revenues and costs, orebody description, geometrical considerations, pit limits, production planning, mineral resources and ore reserves, responsible mining, rock blasting, rotary drilling, shovel loading, haulage trucks and machine availability and utilization.</p><p>Volume 2 includes CSMine and MicroMODEL, user-friendly mine planning and design software packages developed specifically to illustrate the practical application of the involved principles. It also comprises the CSMine and MicroMODEL tutorials and user’s manuals and eight orebody case examples, including drillhole data sets for performing a complete open pit mine evaluation.</p><p><strong>Open Pit Mine Planning and Design</strong> is an excellent textbook for courses in surface mine design, open pit design, geological and excavation engineering, and in advanced open pit mine planning and design. The principles described apply worldwide. In addition, the work can be used as a practical reference by professionals. The step-by-step approach to mine design and planning offers a fast-path approach to the material for both undergraduate and graduate students. The outstanding software guides the student through the planning and design steps, and the eight drillhole data sets allow the student to practice the described principles on different mining properties (three copper properties, three iron properties and two gold properties). The well-written text, the large number of illustrative examples and case studies, the included software, the review questions and exercises and the reference lists included at the end of each chapter provide the student with all the material needed to effectively learn the theory and application of open pit mine planning and design.</p></span></span>",

They have more influence on our lives than any other institution, but while boards of directors are supposed to police CEOs and provide independent leadership, they have become enabling lapdogs rather than trustworthy watchdogs. As America contends with the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, all eyes are turning to the corporate leaders who have perpetrated such egregious failures, padding their own pockets with grossly inflated pay packages even as their businesses fall to ruin, asking, How could things have gone so terribly wrong? How could the stewards of American business-who are supposed to be the gold standard of the global economy-turn out to be so incompetent?</p>\n\n<p>Taking readers right into the boardrooms and behind the scenes of the lavish C-Suites, John Gillespie and David Zweig have interviewed a host of upper-echelon managers and board members at leading companies, from Exxon and Citigroup and Home Depot to Countrywide, to shine a glaring light on the clubby culture of the business elite. The book reveals just how the machinations of good governance have broken down, replaced by a compromised system plagued by greed and see-no-evil culpability, and also reports on a handful of pioneering companies who are bold leaders in corporate reform, offering powerful proof that the system most certainly can be fixed.</p></span>",

APEX is an application development framework for developing database–backed applications. It's easy enough to get started in that power users can quit storing data in random spreadsheets and instead centralize their data in the powerful Oracle database, all without developer help. Developers aren't left out, however. Those who choose to do so can go deep and leverage the full power and flexibility of Oracle's database engine.</p><p>Getting started with APEX is easy; learning how to take full advantage of APEX is the problem. It was the problem, that is, until this book came along. In <em>Pro Oracle Application Express</em>, authors <b>John Scott</b> and <b>Scott Spendolini</b> open the \"hood\" of APEX and expose the full power behind its easy–to–use GUI. They show you what you need to know to produce powerful, professionally polished applications—such as user-authentication models, approaches to layout and navigation, how to integrate Ajax, how to deal with localization issues such as time zones and translations, how to customize the look and feel of an APEX web site, and much, much more.</p><p>The authors are well–qualified to write on APEX. John Scott runs ShellPrompt, a hosting service that handles many large-scale APEX applications, some of which he is paid to develop. John is a hard–core APEX developer. His co-author, Scott Spendolini, is one of the original creators of APEX.

    "description": "<span><p>Mid-market companies are looking for complete solutions from the\nsolution providers who know their businesses and specialize in a\nparticular solution category such as warehouse management or supply\nchain integration, within their industry.</p><p>In order to provide an environment for the business solution,\neither the solution provider or the end customer must obtain the\nsoftware needed to run the provider’s application program.\nThis software normally consists of a database, a Web server, and an\napplication server. These components, which are not actually part\nof the business solution, but are required to support the\napplication program, are called middleware.</p><p>The process of obtaining, installing, configuring, and\nsupporting the middleware components is a complex process for the\nsolution provider, who currently has to absorb the cost of setting\nup the environment. The provider has to work with multiple\nsuppliers who have multiple terms and conditions, different license\nstructures, and multiple departments to work with on the contracts\nand support structures, all of which leads to added infrastructure\ncosts and inefficiency.</p><p>IBM designed the Express Runtime offering to address the needs\nof the solution providers serving mid-market customers. The main\ndesign criteria were reducing complexity for the providers by\noffering a pre-integrated and pre-configured middleware solution\nwith a single contract, one license, one set of contracts, and a\nvery competitive price.</p><p>With Express Runtime, you get WebSphere Application Server -\nExpress, DB2 UDB Express, and IBM HTTP Server with a single\ninstall, one contract, and a significantly lower cost compared to\npurchasing the individual components. Express Runtime includes\nquick start samples and documentation to get you up and running\nquickly and easily.</p><p>Please note that the additional material referenced in the text is not available from IBM.</p></span>",

We discuss what NodeJS is and that it is not a programming language like JavaScript but an interpreter and environment for JavaScript.</p><p>Moving further with section 2, we explore the fundamentals of JavaScript and writing JavaScript code within the Node. It is loaded with examples about the basics of coding JavaScript . As Node uses JavaScript code, this section will provide a refresher and quick overview of JavaScript, and is designed to cover core JavaScript required for the upcoming sections and writing Node.</p><p>JavaScript asynchronous programming explains asynchrony in computer programming, refers to the occurrence of events independent of the main program flow and ways to deal with such events, and shows how to add callbacks that run once a stack is complete.</p><p>Each module in NodeJS has its own context and cannot interfere with other modules. Modules are like libraries that you can include in your application. Node.js has a set of built-in modules you can use without any further installation, such as http, fs, path, and url.</p><p>Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. Explore how to set up a web application quickly with Express.</p><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p>To take this course, you will need to have some knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming, if not C#. Even if you do not have much exposure to the .NET development stack, this course is very beginner-friendly and chock-full of development tips.</p><p>This course is ideal for anyone who wants to learn more about NodeJS, and for JavaScript developers and web developers.</p></span>",
