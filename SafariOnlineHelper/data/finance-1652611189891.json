    "description": "<span><span><span><p><b>How speculation has come to dominate investment—a hard-hitting look from the creator of the first index fund.</b></p><p>Over the course of his sixty-year career in the mutual fund industry, Vanguard Group founder John C. Bogle has witnessed a massive shift in the culture of the financial sector. The prudent, value-adding culture of long-term investment has been crowded out by an aggressive, value-destroying culture of short-term speculation. Mr. Bogle has not been merely an eye-witness to these changes, but one of the financial sector's most active participants. In The Clash of the Cultures, he urges a return to the common sense principles of long-term investing.</p><p>Provocative and refreshingly candid, this book discusses Mr. Bogle's views on the changing culture in the mutual fund industry, how speculation has invaded our national retirement system, the failure of our institutional money managers to effectively participate in corporate governance, and the need for a federal standard of fiduciary duty.</p><p>Mr. Bogle recounts the history of the index mutual fund, how he created it, and how exchange-traded index funds have altered its original concept of long-term investing. He also presents a first-hand history of Wellington Fund, a real-world case study on the success of investment and the failure of speculation. The book concludes with ten simple rules that will help investors meet their financial goals. Here, he presents a common sense strategy that \"may not be the best strategy ever devised. But the number of strategies that are worse is infinite.\"</p><p><em>The Clash of the Cultures: Investment vs. Speculation</em> completes the trilogy of best-selling books, beginning with <em>Bogle on Investing: The First 50 Years (2001) and Don't Count on It! (2011)</em></p></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p><b>A contrarian and controversial look at personal finance, and a super simple strategy for making—and keeping—more money</b></p><p>Traditional financial wisdom persuades us to grow our net worth and build our assets. But traditional financial wisdom is often wrong. In <em>Cash Cows, Pigs and Jackpots: The Simplest Personal Finance Strategy You'll Ever See</em>, author and Chartered Accountant David Trahair challenges everything we think we know about managing our money, suggesting that that we follow the lead of the financial institutions that are leading us down the path to financial ruin.</p><p>The banks, brokers, and investment companies of the world make enormous sums of money because they know that cash is king and they know how to guarantee cash flow from their clients on a continual basis. They aren't making the bulk of their money from investing in the stock market—they're leeching it from regular people like you, every minute of every day. <em>Cash Cows, Pigs and Jackpots</em> turns the tables, showing that the biggest cash cow we have is ourselves. Instead of chasing a dream that will never come true, it presents a financial plan so simple even a 10-year-old could understand it.</p><ul><li><p>Explains why the common consensus about making money is inherently flawed</p></li><li><p>Presents an incredibly simple, easy-to-follow plan for really making and saving money</p></li><li><p>Exposes the dangers of trusting money to a bank or broker</p></li></ul><p>Helping you break asset addiction, get out of debt, and increase your personal cash flow—and your wealth with it, Cash Cows, Pigs and Jackpots explains how bringing more cash into your life and watching carefully where it goes will allow you to save more, live the life you want, and avoid as much risk as possible—a great strategy going into the stormy financial years to come</p></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><span><p><b>Can Islamic finance save the global system?</b></p><p><em>Islamic Finance and the New Financial System</em> describes how the adoption of Islamic finance principles in future regulatory decisions could help prevent future shocks in the global financial system. Using illustrations and examples to highlight key points in recent history, this book discusses the causes of financial crises, why they are becoming more frequent and increasingly severe, and how the new financial system will incorporate elements of Islamic finance - whether deliberately or not. With an introspective look at the system and an examination of the misconceptions and deficiencies in theory vs. practice, readers will learn why Islamic finance has not been as influential as it should be on the larger global system. Solutions to these crises are thoroughly detailed, and the author puts forth a compelling argument about what can be expected in the future.</p><p>Despite international intervention and global policy changes, the financial system remains in a fragile state. There is an argument to be made about integrating Islamic finance into the new system to facilitate stronger resilience, and this book explains the nuts and bolts of the idea while providing the reader with a general understanding of Islamic finance.</p><li><p>Understand the key principles of Islamic finance</p></li><li><p>Examine the history of the current financial system</p></li><li><p>Discover how Islamic finance can help build a new debt-free economy</p></li><li><p>Learn how Islamic finance theory doesn't always dictate practice</p></li><p>Although Islamic finance is a growing market, it is still a foreign concept to many.

    "description": "<span><span><span><p><b>A simple guide to a smarter strategy for the individual investor</b></p><p><em>A Wealth of Common Sense</em> sheds a refreshing light on investing, and shows you how a simplicity-based framework can lead to better investment decisions. The financial market is a complex system, but that doesn't mean it requires a complex strategy; in fact, this false premise is the driving force behind many investors' market \"mistakes.\" Information is important, but understanding and perspective are the keys to better decision-making. This book describes the proper way to view the markets and your portfolio, and show you the simple strategies that make investing more profitable, less confusing, and less time-consuming. Without the burden of short-term performance benchmarks, individual investors have the advantage of focusing on the long view, and the freedom to construct the kind of portfolio that will serve their investment goals best. This book proves how complex strategies essentially waste these advantages, and provides an alternative game plan for those ready to simplify.</p><p>Complexity is often used as a mechanism for talking investors into unnecessary purchases, when all most need is a deeper understanding of conventional options. This book explains which issues you actually should pay attention to, and which ones are simply used for an illusion of intelligence and control.</p><li><p>Keep up with—or beat—professional money managers</p></li><li><p>Exploit stock market volatility to your utmost advantage</p></li><li><p>Learn where advisors and consultants fit into smart strategy</p></li><li><p>Build a portfolio that makes sense for your particular situation</p></li><p>You don't have to outsmart the market if you can simply outperform it. Cut through the confusion and noise and focus on what actually matters. A Wealth of Common Sense clears the air, and gives you the insight you need to become a smarter, more successful investor.</p></span></span></span>",

The book shows how each building block is applied to different markets and to the solution of various risk management and trading problems.</p><p>This new edition will be fully revised to reflect the many changes the derivatives markets have seen over the last three years.  New material will include a comprehensive history of derivatives, leading up to their use and abuse in the current credit crisis.

Baby Boomers are learning to\ndeal with the fact that they really can’t have it all--at\nleast not all at once. <em>Retirementology</em> is a great guide to\nhelping them think through their plans for living, saving, and\nspending.”</p><p><b>Marion Asnes, Editor in Chief,</b><b><em>Financial Planning</em></b><b>magazine</b></p><p>“<em>Retirementology</em> applies\nbehavioral finance to retirement planning and finds we all could be\ndoing a lot better when it comes to making decisions about\nretirement. But don’t despair: Not only does Dr. Salsbury\ncrisply describe our self-destructive financial behavior, he offers\nmuch more--namely, ways we can improve financial decisions. The\nbook is a real contribution to both behavioral finance and the\nfield of retirement planning.”</p><p><b>David Adler, author of</b><b><em>Snap\nJudgment</em></b></p><p>“<em>Retirementology</em> is an\nentertaining, yet sobering, journey through the cognitive errors\nand social biases harming our current and future lifestyles.

Depending on\nyour circumstances and your age, you may no longer have any margin\nfor error. And your emotions and irrational behavior could be\nperpetuating a dangerous cycle of overspending and rising debt that\nmay shatter whatever vision of retirement you still have. Welcome\nto the world of <em>Retirementology</em>.</p><p><em>Retirementology</em> bridges retirement\nplanning with investor psychology and the market Meltdown of 2008\nto produce an entirely new way of thinking about how we spend, how\nwe save, how we borrow, and how we invest. Financial mistakes are\ndeeply rooted in human nature, but you may be able to overcome\nthem--if you understand the breakthrough principles of behavioral\neconomics and apply them in your own retirement planning.</p><p>Dr. Gregory Salsbury identifies some of the\nclassic cognitive biases and behavioral mistakes most of us keep\nmaking when it comes to retirement planning. For example: <em>Why\nwill people drive 45 minutes to use a $2.00 coupon? Why won’t\npeople sell a poor performing stock just because they inherited it\nfrom grandma? Why do people spend differently with a credit card\nthan they do with cash? Why do people believe that they paid no\nincome taxes because they received a refund? Y</em>ou’ll learn\nwhy the financial meltdown has amplified the impact of these\nall-too-human cognitive mistakes and discover ideas for addressing\nthem.</p><p>The bottom line for your bottom line is that\nretirement can no longer be ignored, viewed as a single event,\nrelegated to a “zone,” or romanticized. Instead, you\nmust understand how every spending and financial decision you make\nfrom here on can impact the way you will spend your golden years.\n<em>Retirementology</em> attempts to help you do just that.</p><p><b>Retirement planning: right brain versus\nleft brain</b></p><p><em>Why these different areas of the brain\nimpact financial decisions--and what to do about it</em></p><p><b>It’s</b><b><em>real money!</em></b><b>“De-layering” your finances</b></p><p><em>How to overcome the psychological tricks\nthat separate you from your money</em></p><p><b>Family matters: managing financial\nsupport decisions for your extended family</b></p><p><em>Choosing between your family or your\nretirement</em></p><p><b>Get “long-term smart”</b></p><p><em>How longevity, inflation, volatility, and\nyour own expectations impact your retirement goals</em></p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p><b>Everything you need to harness Millennial potential</b></p><p><i>Managing Millennials For Dummies</i> is the field guide to people-management in the modern workplace. Packed with insight, advice, personal anecdotes, and practical guidance, this book shows you how to manage your Millennial workers and teach them how to manage themselves. You'll learn just what makes them tick—they're definitely not the workers of yesteryear—and how to uncover the deeply inspirational talent they have hiding not far below the surface. Best practices and proven strategies from Google, Netflix, LinkedIn, and other top employers provide real-world models for effective management, and new research on first-wave versus second-wave Millennials helps you parse the difference between your new hires and more experienced workers. You'll learn why flex time, social media, dress code, and organizational structure are shifting, and answer the all-important question: <i>why won't they use the phone</i>?</p><p>Millennials are the product of a different time, with different values, different motivations, and different wants—and in the U.S., they now make up the majority of the workforce. This book shows you how to bring out their best and discover just how much they're really capable of.</p><ul><li>Learn how Millennials are changing the way work gets done</li><li>Understand new motivations, attitudes, values, and drive</li><li>Recruit, motivate, engage, and retain incredible emerging talent</li></ul><ul><li>Discover the keys to optimal Millennial management</li></ul><p>The pop culture narrative would have us believe that Millennials are entitled, lazy, spoiled brats—but the that couldn't be further from the truth. They are the generation of change: highly adaptive, bright, and quick to take on a challenge. Like any generation of workers, performance lies in management—if you're not getting what you need from your Millennials, it's time to learn how to lead them the way they need to be led. <i>Managing Millennials For Dummies</i> is your handbook for allowing them to exceed your expectations. </p></span></span></span>",

There's no better source for both practical and spiritual financial wisdom than the time-tested knowledge found in the ancient Jewish faith and its culture.

    "title": "Gender and Finance",
    "description": "<span><p>This book examines the world of finance and the role of gender within it. It looks at the financial services industry, arguably the most powerful and remunerative sector that exists, and shows how it was created by men for men.</p><p>The author explains how historically women were excluded, how minimal progress has been made, and outlines how the sector still needs to change  to function effectively in a modern, equal opportunities world. Addressing gender inequality in financial services is of utmost urgency and importance because of the extent to which it affects women in all stages of life. Women’s exclusion in financial services is also mirrored by how men have been excluded from parenting through a similar set of societal expectations, government legislation and corporate policies. The author maintains that to succeed, we need to address both financial services and parenting. To do so we need regulatory support. Because of its power and dominance, the financial services industry has the opportunity to lead this change and to champion gender equal practices. These practices are economically beneficial to all participants, not only female employees and consumers. We all need these benefits as we rebuild our economies following the COVID-19 pandemic. The book makes an important contribution to the critical and increasing awareness of gender concerns. It presents insights drawn from original research and data about gender biases.</p><p>The book is an essential secondary text for a range of university courses, including economics, finance and accounting, business studies and gender related courses, as well as MBAs and Executive Education programmes that focus on gender in business. It is also a must read for policy makers, managers in financial services institutions and any other businesses that seek to attract the growing market of female consumers, employees and business leaders.</p></span>",

Despite the availability of automated tools to perform financial calculations, the author demonstrates that a basic grasp of the underlying mathematical formulas and tables is essential to truly understand finance.</p><p>The book begins with an introduction to the most fundamental mathematical concepts, including numbers, exponents, and logarithms; mathematical progressions; and statistical measures. Next, the author explores the mathematics of the time value of money through a discussion of simple interest, bank discount, compound interest, and annuities. Subsequent chapters explore the mathematical aspects of various financial scenarios, including:</p><li><p>Mortgage debt, leasing, and credit and loans</p></li><li><p>Capital budgeting, depreciation, and depletion</p></li><li><p>Break-even analysis and leverage</p></li><li><p>Investing, with coverage of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, options, cost of capital, and ratio analysis</p></li><li><p>Return and risk, along with a discussion of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)</p></li><li><p>Life annuities as well as life, property, and casualty insurance</p></li><p>Throughout the book, numerous examples and exercises present realistic financial scenarios that aid readers in applying their newfound mathematical skills to devise solutions. The author does not promote the use of financial calculators and computers, but rather guides readers through problem solving using formulas and tables with little emphasis on derivations and proofs.</p><p>Extensively class-tested to ensure an easy-to-follow presentation, Mathematical Finance is an excellent book for courses in business, economics, and mathematics of finance at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. The book is also appropriate for consumers and entrepreneurs who need to build their mathematical skills in order to better understand financial problems and make better financial choices.</p></span></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p><strong>An insider’s look at the SEC and the changes needed to strengthen the U.S. financial system</strong></p><p>In 2008, Americans were reeling from the devastating financial crisis that caused the Great Recession. There were searing questions about how the crisis was allowed to happen and calls for immediate reform from Capital Hill, the news media, and the general public. Multiple scandals sent real fear through the investing community and brought unprecedented heat on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). There was little doubt that the SEC had to fix rules that permitted bad behavior, shake off decades of complacency and enforce existing laws.</p><p>Wall Street lawyer Norm Champ spent nearly 20 years dealing with the SEC on behalf of his clients and as an industry representative working to educate the agency about hedge funds. Believing he could help reform the deeply-flawed agency, Champ left his career in the private sector and joined the SEC. As Director of the Division of Investment Management, he became a key player in stabilizing trillions of dollars of investor capital while reenergizing the SEC’s culture and management.</p><p>In <em>Going Public</em>, Champ presents a rare, insider’s look at how the SEC operates and explains exactly how the agency impacts the overall economic health of the country. He examines the inner workings of hedge funds, economic policy and politics, investing, and inefficient and frustrating federal agencies. Engrossing and important, this book offers critical recommendations for policy changes that will create healthy, free-functioning markets and help Americans better prepare for the inevitable next crisis.<br/>\n</p></span></span>",

Chapter 1 sets out an overview of News Analytics (NA) with an explanation of the technology and applications. The rest of the chapters are presented in four parts. Part 1 contains an explanation of methods and models which are used to measure and quantify news sentiment. In Part 2 the relationship between news events and discovery of abnormal returns (the elusive alpha) is discussed in detail by the leading researchers and industry experts. The material in this part also covers potential application of NA to trading and fund management. Part 3 covers the use of quantified news for the purpose of monitoring, early diagnostics and risk control. Part 4 is entirely industry focused; it contains insights of experts from leading technology (content) vendors. It also contains a discussion of technologies and finally a compact directory of content vendor and financial analytics companies in the marketplace of NA. The book draws equally upon the expertise of academics and practitioners who have developed these models and is supported by two major content vendors - RavenPack and Thomson Reuters - leading providers of news analytics software and machine readable news.</p><p>The book will appeal to decision makers in the banking, finance and insurance services industry. In particular: asset managers; quantitative fund managers; hedge fund managers; algorithmic traders; proprietary (program) trading desks; sell-side firms; brokerage houses; risk managers and research departments will benefit from the unique insights into this new and pertinent area of financial modelling.</p></span></span></span>",

No one else has nearly as much experience on the front lines as Bill Rhodes. All who care about the 21st century will profit from close study of his thoughts.\" </em><br/><b>—Lawrence H. Summers, Charles W. Eliot University Professor and President Emeritus at Harvard University, former Secretary of the Treasury for President Clinton, and former Director of the National Economic Council for President Obama</b></p><p><em>\"Rhodes's recollections are lively and richly detailed, replete with glimpses of top-ranking personalities from the world of banking and government interacting under pressure, and they provide a rare window into how these important but normally secretive operations of high-level international finance actually work. . . . \"<b/></em><b><br/>—The New York Review of Books</b></p><p><em>\"Mr. Rhodes was one of the few members of the financial establishment to sense that the world was on the brink of a calamity in 2007 (most of the prophets of doom were either academic theoreticians or maverick financiers) . . . . Mr. Rhodes is rightly proud of his record in defusing debt bombs and calming financial storms. Let's hope that his successors will be able to make similar boasts in the decades to come.\"</em><br/><b>—The Wall Street Journal</b></p><p><em>\"Bill Rhodes has made it his life’s work to bring common sense to the most serious international problems. On something I know firsthand, the Brady Plan, Bill's steady support and energy were invaluable to its conclusion. This comes as no surprise--that's what he always does.\"</em><br/><b>—Nicholas Brady, former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury</b></p><p>\"<em>Banker to the World</em>, <em>a book exceptionally well titled, is an illuminating lesson in leadership, diplomacy, vision, and tenacity. It will be required reading at all levels of finance.\"</em><br/><b>—Henry Kissinger, former U.S. Secretary of State</b></p><p><em>\"His memoir is a must for anyone who wants to recapture the behind-the-scenes details of this important recent era of banking history.\"</em><br/><b>—Robert Mundell, Nobel Laureate and Professor, Columbia University</b></p><p><em>“William Rhodes’ book is an important and interesting one, and something that those who want to understand the past and present better would do well to read. A highly talented banker and wise statesman, Rhodes’ book is essential reading as a history, business, and life lesson.”</em><br/><b>–Forbes.com</b></p><p><em>\"[S]hould be required reading not only for other bankers, but also for Washington’s would-be reformers of Wall Street, but most of all for the ordinary lay citizens dismayed by the persisting panic. . . .”.”</em><br/><b>–American Spectator</b></p><p><em>“An absorbing read.”</em><br/><b>—Foreign Affairs</b></p><p><em>“Anyone interested in learning what lessons the emerging markets restructurings might hold for Europe should read William Rhodes' book </em>Banker to the World<em>.”</em><br/><b>—John Dizard, Financial Times</b></p><p>In more than five decades with Citi, William \"Bill\" Rhodes, the firm's former senior vice chairman and senior international officer, has worked with senior business leaders, statesmen, and strongmen and brokered immense financial deals while looking across the table at finance ministers . . . and up the barrels of guns trained on him. He has earned the cooperation of Fidel Castro over cigars and the admiration of Rupert Murdoch, who said of Rhodes, <em>\"By dogged hard work, Bill forms important and great relationships. Everyone knows Bill. Everyone trusts Bill.\"</em></p><p>From these and other experiences, Rhodes has learned a lifetime of lessons about managing amid crises--and, more important, how to lead prudently, decisively, and effectively to prevent crises from ever happening in the first place. In <em>Banker to the World</em>, Rhodes presents his collected wisdom, best-practices, analysis, and anecdotes in one essential volume on the creation of value through leadership--and on the importance of leading by one's values.</p></div></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p><em>CFO Techniques: A Hands-on Guide to Keeping Your Business Solvent and Successful</em> is a comprehensive and instructive working manual for multitasking chief financial officers and controllers working in the fast-paced commercial environment. Every senior financial professional with an ever-broadening span of control will benefit from this complete outline of the core activities—with specific descriptions of individual tasks—comprising the daily agenda of a successful CFO or controller.

    "description": "<span><span><span><span><p>As with his weekly column, James Montier's <em>Value Investing</em> is a must read for all students of the financial markets. In short order, Montier shreds the 'efficient market hypothesis', elucidates the pertinence of behavioral finance, and explains the crucial difference between investment process and investment outcomes. Montier makes his arguments with clear insight and spirited good humor, and then backs them up with cold hard facts. Buy this book for yourself, and for anyone you know who cares about their capital!</p><p><b>—Seth Klarman</b>, President, The Baupost Group LLC</p><p>The seductive elegance of classical finance theory is powerful, yet value investing requires that we reject both the precepts of modern portfolio theory (MPT) and pretty much all of its tools and techniques.</p><p>In this important new book, the highly respected and controversial value investor and behavioural analyst, James Montier explains how value investing is the only tried and tested method of delivering sustainable long-term returns.</p><p>James shows you why everything you learnt at business school is wrong; how to think properly about valuation and risk; how to avoid the dangers of growth investing; how to be a contrarian; how to short stocks; how to avoid value traps; how to hedge ignorance using cheap insurance. Crucially he also gives real time examples of the principles outlined in the context of the 2008/09 financial crisis.</p><p>In this book James shares his tried and tested techniques and provides the latest and most cutting edge tools you will need to deploy the value approach successfully.</p><p>It provides you with the tools to start thinking in a different fashion about the way in which you invest, introducing the ways of over-riding the emotional distractions that will bedevil the pursuit of a value approach and ultimately think and act differently from the herd.</p></span></span></span></span>",

The anti-globalization\nmovement wants more trade protectionism and less immigration. The\nglobal credit crisis is putting pressure on governments to bail out\nirresponsible lenders and borrowers at taxpayers’ expense.\nInstead, Donlan convincingly and clearly explains why we would all\nprosper more by doing all we can to make markets freer.”</p><p>—Ed Yardeni, President, Yardeni\nResearch, Inc.</p><p>“Thomas Donlan reminds us all that\ncapitalism is not simply one choice among different and equally\nvalid economic systems, but instead that hard work and the\naccumulation of wealth is the natural tendency of successful people\nand healthy societies around the world.”</p><p>—Christopher Whalen, Managing\nDirector, Institutional Risk Analytics</p><p>“It has been several decades since\nJoseph Schumpeter observed that the philosophical defense of a\nfree-market economy must never cease. Thomas Donlan has taken up\nthat challenge, but this clear-eyed book is much more than a\ndefense.

    "description": "<span><p><strong>Overcome debt, make smart money decisions, and build a financially secure future</strong></p><p>Do you support your family, pay your taxes, get the bills done on time—and yet still struggle to achieve financial security? If so, you’re not alone. About one-third of all Americans have not saved for retirement, another third have no savings at all, and more than half have no budget.</p><p>How did we get here? Two words: financial illiteracy. As money and finance have become more complex over the decades, the average American has not been able to keep up—in essence, leaving our personal financial decisions up to banks, bureaucrats, policymakers, and even fraudsters.</p><p>Norm Champ, a former director at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), provides an in-depth primer on how money works, designed just for you—the non-finance reader. Champ shows how to:</p><p>• Pay off your loans and stay out of debt for the long run<br/>\n• Build savings that will see you through thick and thin<br/>\n• Avoid financial disaster—from bad credit deals to outright scams<br/>\n• Start building a safe, smart investing portfolio</p><p>Our financial system is easier to grasp than you think—and armed with this new knowledge and insight, you’ll finally take control of your financial future.</p><p>When you know how money works, you make better financial decisions. It’s that simple. <em>Mastering Money</em> demystifies finance and provides plainspoken, straightforward advice for building a solid financial foundation you can count on in good times and bad.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span>\n    “As so many Americans feel powerless to confront a financial system designed to serve the few, Shuman offers us real choices: tools that align our lives with our values. That's power. I love this highly readable, timely, surprising book.” <br/>—Frances Moore Lappé, author of Daring Democracy and Diet for a Small Planet <br/><br/>Americans agree on very little these days, but red state conservatives and blue state progressives can agree on one critical point: Wall Street can no longer be trusted. Yet most of us continue to invest our money in the stocks and bonds of Fortune 500 companies, transferring our capital far from where we live and work. Local investing expert Michael Shuman offers another alternative. He shows how we can use two well-established—but rarely used—investment tools to keep our money close and get a return as good as or better than what we'd get investing in distant, indifferent corporations. <br/><br/>Shuman explains the nuts and bolts of self-directed IRAs and solo 401(k)s and how they can be combined with other recently legalized local investing tools. He details how to set these accounts up, identify and evaluate a whole range of local investment opportunities, and make sure account holders stay on the right side of the law. While the book is written for people without a lot of investment experience—Shuman explains concepts like “liquidity” and “diversification” in simple terms—even if you're as experienced as Warren Buffett, this book will make you rethink everything you know about investing. With Shuman's expert advice, you can strengthen your investment portfolio and your community, neighborhoods, and schools at the same time!\n  </span>",

    "description": "<span><p><i>Making Money With Option Strategies</i> is a practical, down-to-earth guide that introduces and fully explains an action plan to reduce risk in any stock portfolio.There are many options books available already, and they fall into two major categories: basic primers limited to explaining the terminology and market of options; and more advanced books discussing theory and pricing models of options.None of these books addresses the largest audience of all—those who know the basics but are not interested in theories and pricing models. They want clear, practical ways to apply these principles to make money and reduce their risks. Making Money With Option Strategies is designed for this market.Michael has traded options since the mid-1970s and is the best-selling options author in the United States. His best-selling <i>Getting Started in Options</i>, a beginner’s book now in its ninth edition, has sold more than 300,000 copies since 1986.Many people view options as exotic, complex, and high-risk beasts. They are not. If your portfolio risk keeps you up at night, adding carefully designed option strategies to hedge risks will help you get a good night’s sleep.</p></span>",

In his last book, <i>Quantitative Value</i>, author Wes Gray brought systematic value strategy from the hedge funds to the masses; in this book, he does the same for momentum investing, the system that has been shown to beat the market and regularly enriches the coffers of Wall Street's most sophisticated investors. First, you'll learn what momentum investing is <i>not</i>: it's not 'growth' investing, nor is it an esoteric academic concept. You may have seen it used for asset allocation, but this book details the ways in which momentum stands on its own as a stock selection strategy, and gives you the expert insight you need to make it work for you. You'll dig into its behavioral psychology roots, and discover the key tactics that are bringing both institutional and individual investors flocking into the momentum fold. </p><p>Systematic investment strategies always seem to look good on paper, but many fall down in practice. Momentum investing is one of the few systematic strategies with legs, withstanding the test of time and the rigor of academic investigation. This book provides invaluable guidance on constructing your own momentum strategy from the ground up. </p><ul><li>Learn what momentum is and is <i>not</i></li><li>Discover how momentum can beat the market</li><li>Take momentum beyond asset allocation into stock selection</li><li>Access the tools that ease DIY implementation</li></ul><p>The large Wall Street hedge funds tend to portray themselves as the sophisticated elite, but momentum investing allows you to 'borrow' one of their top strategies to enrich your own portfolio. <i>Quantitative Momentum</i> is the individual investor's guide to boosting market success with a robust momentum strategy.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>This title includes additional digital media when purchased in print format. For this digital book edition, media content may NOT be included. Contact the publisher's customer service directly for assistance.</p><p><strong>A hands-on guide to the use of quantitative methods and software for making successful business decisions</strong></p><p>The appropriate use of quantitative methods lies at the core of successful decisions made by managers, researchers, and students in the field of business. Providing a framework for the development of sound judgment and the ability to utilize quantitative and qualitative approaches, <em>Data Driven Business Decisions</em> introduces readers to the important role that data plays in understanding business outcomes, addressing four general areas that managers need to know about: data handling and Microsoft Excel, uncertainty, the relationship between inputs and outputs, and complex decisions with trade-offs and uncertainty.</p><p>Grounded in the author's own classroom approach to business statistics, the book reveals how to use data to understand the drivers of business outcomes, which in turn allows for data-driven business decisions. A basic, non-mathematical foundation in statistics is provided, outlining for readers the tools needed to link data with business decisions; account for uncertainty in the actions of others and in patterns revealed by data; handle data in Excel; translate their analysis into simple business terms; and present results in simple tables and charts. The author discusses key data analytic frameworks, such as decision trees and multiple regression, and also explores additional topics, including:</p><ul><li>Use of the Excel functions Solver and Goal Seek</li><li>Partial correlation and auto-correlation</li><li>Interactions and proportional variation in regression models</li><li>Seasonal adjustment and what it reveals</li><li>Basic portfolio theory as an introduction to correlations</li></ul><p>Chapters are introduced with case studies that integrate simple ideas into the larger business context, and are followed by further details, raw data, and motivating insights. Algebraic notation is used only when necessary, and throughout the book, the author utilizes real-world examples from diverse areas such as market surveys, finance, economics, and business ethics. Excel add-ins StatproGo and TreePlan are showcased to demonstrate execution of the techniques, and a related website features extensive programming instructions as well as insights, data sets, and solutions to problems included in the material. The enclosed CD contains the complete book in electronic format, including all presented data, supplemental material on the discussed case files, and links to exercises and solutions.</p><p><em>Data Driven Business Decisions</em> is an excellent book for MBA quantitative analysis courses or undergraduate general statistics courses. It also serves as a valuable reference for practicing MBAs and practitioners in the fields of statistics, business, and finance.</p></span>",

    "title": "Money: How the Destruction of the Dollar Threatens the Global Economy – and What We Can Do About It",
    "description": "<span><span><h4>Why a return to sound money is our only hope for a true recovery and a healthy global economy</h4><p><i>“<b>Money</b> clearly illustrates that sound money is an essential foundation for a free and prosperous society and that the Federal Reserve’s current policies are a greater threat to the economic future of the U.S. than government deficit spending. This is an important book well worth reading.”</i> -- John A. Allison, President and CEO, Cato Institute, and author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling <i>The Financial Crisis and the Free Market Cure</i></p><p><i>“Few topics today are as misunderstood as the subject of money. Steve Forbes understands money better than most heads of state do, and in this provocative book he shares his vast knowledge and gives us sensible and time-tested recommendations for stopping future financial meltdowns.”</i> -- Lawrence Kudlow, CNBC Senior Contributor</p><p><i>“Economic and monetary policies can be difficult to master for even the savviest politicians. <b>Money</b> effectively communicates these complexities into a cohesive argument for economic recovery and preventing a new financial crisis. Steve Forbes and Elizabeth Ames deliver a gripping read and an intriguing viewpoint on how to get our economy back on track.” </i>--Greta Van Susteren, host of On the Record, Fox News Channel</p><p>Few topics are as misunderstood today as the subject of money. Since the U.S. abandoned a gold-linked dollar more than four decades ago, the world’s governments have slid into a dangerous ignorance of the fundamental monetary principles that guided the world’s most successful economies for centuries. Today’s wrong-headed monetary policies are now setting the stage for a new global economic and social catastrophe that could rival the recent financial crisis and even the horrors of the 1930s. Coauthored by Steve Forbes, one of the world’s leading experts on finance, <i>Money</i> shows you why that doesn’t need to happen--and how to prevent it.</p><p>After reading this entertaining and hugely well-informed book, you will know more about money than most people in the highest government positions today. <i>Money</i> explains why a return to sound money is absolutely essential if the U.S. and other nations are ever to overcome today’s problems. Stable money, Steve Forbes and Elizabeth Ames argue, is the only way to a true recovery and a stable and prosperous economy.</p><p>Today’s system of fluctuating “fiat” money, in which governments manipulate the value of the dollar and other currencies, has been responsible for the biggest economic failures of recent decades, including the 2008 financial crisis, from whose effects we continue to suffer. The Obama/Bernanke/Yellen Federal Reserve and its unstable dollar policies are accelerating our course toward disaster, the authors show, in numerous convincing examples. In <i>Money</i>, Forbes and Ames answer these crucial questions:</p><p><i>What is the difference between money and value? What is real wealth?</i></p><p><i>How does sound money contribute to a well-functioning society?</i></p><p><i>How have our money policy errors led to the current problems in global financial markets?</i></p><p><i>What can we do now to reestablish the strength of the dollar and other currencies?</i></p><p>The authors argue that the most effective way to return to a sound money policy and a healthy economy is to put the dollar back on a gold standard, and they outline the several different forms a gold standard could take. They also share invaluable suggestions for how to preserve our wealth and where to invest our money.</p><p><i>Money</i> is essential reading for anyone interested in this crucially important subject.</p></span></span>",

    "title": "Protect Your Wealth from the Ravages of Inflation: A Three-Step Method",
    "description": "<span><span><span><p><em>Protect Your Wealth from the Ravages of Inflation</em> is for people who have financial assets to protect in an unpredictable, inflationary environment. Maybe you have tried traditional financial advice, financial planning, and passive investment management techniques and you're still losing ground. Maybe you're worried that by the time you need to use it, your retirement fund will be worth less than your total contributions. Maybe you believe that high inflation will significantly decrease your standard of living in the future. Maybe all of these issues apply to you. Don't despair; help is at hand.</p><p><em>Protect Your Wealth from the Ravages of Inflation</em> is a concise, no-nonsense, straightforward guide that will help you to do three things:</p><ol><li><p><b>Ensure that your emergency fund will still have some purchasing power when you need it</b>. Emergency funds sitting in checking accounts, or near-cash investments, will just be eaten away by inflation. There is a better way to give you access to the cash you need when you need it. This book shows you how.</p></li><li><p><b>Insulate you from significant changes in the strength of your home currency</b>. If all your income and expenses are in a single currency like the U.?Show More S. dollar, you run a significant risk that your home-country currency will lose value. Currency risk in your income-purchasing power and working capital is often overlooked until it's too late to do anything about it. This book deals with this issue and gives you easy-to-follow advice to protect the value of your money.</p></li><li><p><b>Generate a better risk-adjusted return in your investment accounts</b>. Buying a basket of stocks and mutual funds and then performing the traditional \"annual rebalancing of a diversified portfolio\" just doesn't generate the returns most people require from their investments. This book shows you simple, powerful, and sophisticated techniques you can use to manage your investment accounts more effectively—and without making it a full-time job.</p></li></ol><p><em>Protect Your Wealth from the Ravages of Inflation</em> can't guarantee that you will meet your financial goals, but it can guarantee that your odds of success will be significantly increased if you follow its advice. The book:</p><ul><li><p>Explains why traditional investing methods virtually guarantee a negative rate of return in real terms.</p></li><li><p>Illustrates the pernicious effect of inflation on an average investor's portfolio—and why an inflationary period may be in the offing.</p></li><li><p>Provides a three-step process to withstand emergencies, protect your liquid assets, and produce a superior risk-adjusted return on a stock portfolio compared with conventional investing methods.</p></li></ul><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><ul><li><p>How government policy normally leads to a debasement of the currency and subsequently an inflationary environment</p></li><li><p>How inflation significantly reduces your standard of living unless you can consistently increase your income or reduce your expense</p></li><li><p>How the current U.S. Consumer Price Index seriously underestimates true inflation</p></li><li><p>How to construct an inflation-proof emergency fund</p></li><li><p>How to mitigate home-currency risk</p></li><li><p>How to generate a better-than-average risk-adjusted return in investment accounts</p></li><li><p>How to do all this before it's too late</p></li></ul><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p>The book is aimed at people who have reached a level of financial stability and whose income is greater than monthly expenses. They have emergency cash, day-to-day working capital, and investment accounts (including retirement accounts) to protect and grow in a potentially inflationary environment. Although U.S. residents will be the primary focus, all the methods and techniques presented should be relatively straightforward to adapt to any country with a fiat currency.</p></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p>An accessible introduction to the essential quantitative methods for making valuable business decisions</p><p>Quantitative methods-research techniques used to analyze quantitative data-enable professionals to organize and understand numbers and, in turn, to make good decisions. <em>Quantitative Methods: An Introduction for Business Management</em> presents the application of quantitative mathematical modeling to decision making in a business management context and emphasizes not only the role of data in drawing conclusions, but also the pitfalls of undiscerning reliance of software packages that implement standard statistical procedures. With hands-on applications and explanations that are accessible to readers at various levels, the book successfully outlines the necessary tools to make smart and successful business decisions.</p><p>Progressing from beginner to more advanced material at an easy-to-follow pace, the author utilizes motivating examples throughout to aid readers interested in decision making and also provides critical remarks, intuitive traps, and counterexamples when appropriate.</p><p>The book begins with a discussion of motivations and foundations related to the topic, with introductory presentations of concepts from calculus to linear algebra. Next, the core ideas of quantitative methods are presented in chapters that explore introductory topics in probability, descriptive and inferential statistics, linear regression, and a discussion of time series that includes both classical topics and more challenging models. The author also discusses linear programming models and decision making under risk as well as less standard topics in the field such as game theory and Bayesian statistics. Finally, the book concludes with a focus on selected tools from multivariate statistics, including advanced regression models and data reduction methods such as principal component analysis, factor analysis, and cluster analysis.</p><p>The book promotes the importance of an analytical approach, particularly when dealing with a complex system where multiple individuals are involved and have conflicting incentives. A related website features Microsoft Excel® workbooks and MATLAB® scripts to illustrate concepts as well as additional exercises with solutions.</p><p><em>Quantitative Methods</em> is an excellent book for courses on the topic at the graduate level. The book also serves as an authoritative reference and self-study guide for financial and business professionals, as well as readers looking to reinforce their analytical skills.</p></span></span></span>",

    "title": "DeFi and the Future of Finance",
    "description": "<span><p><b>During the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, our financial infrastructure failed. </b></p><p>Govern­ments bailed out the very institutions that let the economy down. This episode spurred a serious rethink of our financial system. Does it make any sense that it takes two days to settle a stock transaction? Why do retailers, operating on razor thin margins, have to pay 3% for every customer credit card swipe? Why does it take two days to transfer money from a bank account to a brokerage—or any other company? Why are savings rates miniscule or negative? Why is it so difficult for entrepreneurs to get financ­ing at traditional banks?</p><p>In <i>DeFi and the Future of Finance</i>, Campbell R. Harvey, Ashwin Ramachandran and Joey Santoro, introduce the new world of Decen­tralized Finance. The book argues that the current financial landscape is ripe for dis­ruption and we are seeing, in real time, the reinvention of finance.</p><p>The authors provide the reader with a clear assessment of the problems with the current financial system and how DeFi solves many of these problems. The essence of DeFi is that we interact with peers—there is no brick and mortar and all of the associated costs. Savings and lending are reinvented. Trading takes place with algorithms far re­moved from traditional brokerages.</p><p>The book conducts a deep dive on some of the most innovative protocols such as Uniswap and Compound. Many of the companies featured in the book you might not have heard of—however, you will in the future.</p><p>As with any new technology, there are a myriad of risks and the authors carefully catalogue these risks and assess which ones can be successfully mitigated.</p><p>Ideally suited for people working in any part of the finance industry as well as finan­cial policy makers, <i>DeFi and the Future of Finance </i>gives readers a vision of the future. The world of finance will fundamentally be changed over the coming decade. The book enables you to become part of the disruption – not the target of the disruption.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><b>A new textbook offering a comprehensive introduction to models and techniques for the emerging field of actuarial Finance</b></p><p>Drs. Boudreault and Renaud answer the need for a clear, application-oriented guide to the growing field of actuarial finance with this volume, which focuses on the mathematical models and techniques used in actuarial finance for the pricing and hedging of actuarial liabilities exposed to financial markets and other contingencies. With roots in modern financial mathematics, actuarial finance presents unique challenges due to the long-term nature of insurance liabilities, the presence of mortality or other contingencies and the structure and regulations of the insurance and pension markets.</p><p>Motivated, designed and written for and by actuaries, this book puts actuarial applications at the forefront in addition to balancing mathematics and finance at an adequate level to actuarial undergraduates. While the classical theory of financial mathematics is discussed, the authors provide a thorough grounding in such crucial topics as recognizing embedded options in actuarial liabilities, adequately quantifying and pricing liabilities, and using derivatives and other assets to manage actuarial and financial risks.</p><p>Actuarial applications are emphasized and illustrated with about 300 examples and 200 exercises. The book also comprises end-of-chapter point-form summaries to help the reader review the most important concepts. Additional topics and features include:</p><ul><li>Compares pricing in insurance and financial markets</li><li>Discusses event-triggered derivatives such as weather, catastrophe and longevity derivatives and how they can be used for risk management;</li><li>Introduces equity-linked insurance and annuities (EIAs, VAs), relates them to common derivatives and how to manage mortality for these products</li><li>Introduces pricing and replication in incomplete markets and analyze the impact of market incompleteness on insurance and risk management;</li><li>Presents immunization techniques alongside Greeks-based hedging;</li><li>Covers in detail how to delta-gamma/rho/vega hedge a liability and how to rebalance periodically a hedging portfolio.</li></ul><p>This text will prove itself a firm foundation for undergraduate courses in financial mathematics or economics, actuarial mathematics or derivative markets. It is also highly applicable to current and future actuaries preparing for the exams or actuary professionals looking for a valuable addition to their reference shelf. </p><p>As of 2019, the book covers significant parts of the Society of Actuaries’ Exams FM, IFM and QFI Core, and the Casualty Actuarial Society’s Exams 2 and 3F. It is assumed the reader has basic skills in calculus (differentiation and integration of functions), probability (at the level of the Society of Actuaries’ Exam P), interest theory (time value of money) and, ideally, a basic understanding of elementary stochastic processes such as random walks.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span>\n    \n      Arguably the strongest addition to numerical finance of the past decade, Algorithmic Adjoint Differentiation (AAD) is the technology implemented in modern financial software to produce thousands of accurate risk sensitivities, within seconds, on light hardware.<br/><br/>AAD recently became a centerpiece of modern financial systems and a key skill for all quantitative analysts, developers, risk professionals or anyone involved with derivatives. It is increasingly taught in Masters and PhD programs in finance.<br/><br/>Danske Bank's wide scale implementation of AAD in its production and regulatory systems won the In-House System of the Year 2015 Risk award. The Modern Computational Finance books, written by three of the very people who designed Danske Bank's systems, offer a unique insight into the modern implementation of financial models. The volumes combine financial modelling, mathematics and programming to resolve real life financial problems and produce effective derivatives software.<br/><br/>This volume is a complete, self-contained learning reference for AAD, and its application in finance. AAD is explained in deep detail throughout chapters that gently lead readers from the theoretical foundations to the most delicate areas of an efficient implementation, such as memory management, parallel implementation and acceleration with expression templates.<br/><br/>The book comes with professional source code in C++, including an efficient, up to date implementation of AAD and a generic parallel simulation library. Modern C++, high performance parallel programming and interfacing C++ with Excel are also covered. The book builds the code step-by-step, while the code illustrates the concepts and notions developed in the book.\n   \n  </span>",

    "title": "Carbon Risk and Green Finance",
    "description": "<span><p>As the world plans for economic recovery following the global COVID-19 pandemic, major economies are looking to comprehensive strategies for addressing carbon risks and identifying green finance opportunities. Since Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and Michael Bloomberg began tackling climate change as a financial concern, the international financial community has been developing sophisticated analytical tools that will enable the success of comprehensive efforts to address carbon risks and identify green finance opportunities.</p><p>This timely publication offers a cutting-edge analysis of the financial aspects of climate change. It discusses the most important analytical tools, their origin, how they work, where they can go, and how they fit into a larger strategy. First, reporting frameworks can allow companies to see how well they are addressing carbon risks, in particular with respect to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. Second, by quantifying how much greenhouse gas companies emit into the atmosphere as a direct or indirect result of their operations, carbon footprint calculations can help identify carbon risks with particular companies, especially within supply chains. Third, brown taxonomies can help investors identify current carbon risks by classifying fossil fuel assets in a systematic manner. Fourth, green taxonomies can help investors identify current green finance opportunities by classifying sustainable activities in a systematic manner. Fifth, scenario analysis for assets can help investors identify future carbon risks and green finance opportunities. Finally, stress testing for liabilities can help insurers and banks address future carbon risks and better inform policymakers.</p><p>Scholars, policymakers, and business professionals will find this book informative. They will gain a comprehensive understanding of the analytical tools supporting efforts to address carbon risks and identify green finance opportunities. This will hopefully make these individuals more successful in their personal endeavors to build a more sustainable and resilient economy for future generations.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>This book is an introduction to financial mathematics. It is intended for graduate students in mathematics and for researchers working in academia and industry.<br/>The focus on stochastic models in discrete time has two immediate benefits. First, the probabilistic machinery is simpler, and one can discuss right away some of the key problems in the theory of pricing and hedging of financial derivatives. Second, the paradigm of a complete financial market, where all derivatives admit a perfect hedge, becomes the exception rather than the rule. Thus, the need to confront the intrinsic risks arising from market incomleteness appears at a very early stage.<br/>The first part of the book contains a study of a simple one-period model, which also serves as a building block for later developments. Topics include the characterization of arbitrage-free markets, preferences on asset profiles, an introduction to equilibrium analysis, and monetary measures of financial risk.<br/>In the second part, the idea of dynamic hedging of contingent claims is developed in a multiperiod framework. Topics include martingale measures, pricing formulas for derivatives, American options, superhedging, and hedging strategies with minimal shortfall risk.<br/>This fourth, newly revised edition contains more than one hundred exercises. It also includes material on risk measures and the related issue of model uncertainty, in particular a chapter on dynamic risk measures and sections on robust utility maximization and on efficient hedging with convex risk measures. </p><p><strong>Contents:<br/>Part I: Mathematical finance in one period</strong><br/>Arbitrage theory<br/>Preferences<br/>Optimality and equilibrium<br/>Monetary measures of risk<br/><strong>Part II: Dynamic hedging</strong><br/>Dynamic arbitrage theory<br/>American contingent claims<br/>Superhedging<br/>Efficient hedging<br/>Hedging under constraints<br/>Minimizing the hedging error<br/>Dynamic risk measures </p></span>",

    "title": "Can Finance Save the World?",
    "description": "<span>\n    Can Finance Save the World?<br/>Regaining Power over Money to Serve the Common Good<br/><br/>Just as Thomas Piketty offered a sweeping critique and progressive reassessment of capitalism, former World Bank Group chief financial officer Bertrand Badré looks at the destructive role finance played in the global economic crisis of 2007–2008 and offers a bold prescription for making it a force for good. <br/><br/>Badré says that finance is inherently neither good nor bad. It's just a tool—the most powerful tool on earth. Used correctly, it can be at the heart of the way we address many of the world's biggest problems, ranging from climate change to the eradication of poverty to building much-needed infrastructure. He describes innovations in financial tools and approaches that are already happening around the world and looks at the role regulation can play in channeling the power of finance in a positive direction. He details options for strengthening international cooperation for financial stability and prosperity and overcoming the blinkered nationalism currently on the rise. And he tells what is working and what needs to change in financing the sustainable development of the world. <br/><br/>This book is rich with practical examples, some developed by Badré himself. For instance, he describes how at the World Bank he devised an innovative way to use insurance, a financial tool rarely considered in international development, to buttress fragile emerging economies against natural disasters and pandemics. Initiatives like these show that, as Badré writes, “when controlled and used intelligently, with benevolence and inventiveness, finance can accomplish great things.”<br/><br/>\n  </span>",

Prevention and anticipation being the best defenses against a nuclear accident, the authorities have also categorized the different types of accidents, and are doing research to better understand and control them. In light of this, this book shows how the authorities take practical measures to protect neighboring populations and limit radioactive contamination of the environment. France's experience in this arena is well-documented and a chapter of this book is devoted to the fight against terrorist attacks in the nuclear field. Nuclear Accidents is based on scientifically-recognized publications, as well as on reports from the various countries concerned, and the national and international organizations competent in this field (IAEA, WHO, UNSCEAR, IRSN, etc.).<br/>   </p></span>",

Much of the decision-making for people derives from experiences and exposure. The ability to see multiple perspectives allows for a higher level of understanding, increasing common sense perception. The common belief for the concept of common sense is a general acceptance as a usual occurrence or stance among people. However, reality demonstrates that people view topics very differently. Technology and varying media outlets create many avenues for information leading to conflicting positions and confusion.</p><p>This book provides a straightforward method of removing distortions among education, business practices, finances, and ownership. There are countless variables, obstacles, and barriers inherent in life's journey, and operating with common sense will alleviate many issues. However, exposure to information, experiences, and education redefines what is \"common.\" Readers will learn how their thoughts, viewpoints, and focus shape their responses and navigation through important decision-making realities. This book serves as a tool for increasing decision-making.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p><b>A comprehensive introduction to various numerical methods used in computational finance today</b></p><p>Quantitative skills are a prerequisite for anyone working in finance or beginning a career in the field, as well as risk managers. A thorough grounding in numerical methods is necessary, as is the ability to assess their quality, advantages, and limitations. This book offers a thorough introduction to each method, revealing the numerical traps that practitioners frequently fall into. Each method is referenced with practical, real-world examples in the areas of valuation, risk analysis, and calibration of specific financial instruments and models. It features a strong emphasis on robust schemes for the numerical treatment of problems within computational finance. Methods covered include PDE/PIDE using finite differences or finite elements, fast and stable solvers for sparse grid systems, stabilization and regularization techniques for inverse problems resulting from the calibration of financial models to market data, Monte Carlo and Quasi Monte Carlo techniques for simulating high dimensional systems, and local and global optimization tools to solve the minimization problem.</p></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>A renowned economist's classic book on capitalism in the developing world, showing how property rights are the key to overcoming poverty.</p>\n\n<p>\"The hour of capitalism's greatest triumph,\" writes Hernando de Soto, \"is, in the eyes of four-fifths of humanity, its hour of crisis.\" In The Mystery of Capital, the world-famous Peruvian economist takes up one of the most pressing questions the world faces today: Why do some countries succeed at capitalism while others fail?</p>\n\n<p>In strong opposition to the popular view that success is determined by cultural differences, de Soto finds that it actually has everything to do with the legal structure of property and property rights. Every developed nation in the world at one time went through the transformation from predominantly extralegal property arrangements, such as squatting on large estates, to a formal, unified legal property system. In the West we've forgotten that creating this system is what allowed people everywhere to leverage property into wealth. This persuasive book revolutionized our understanding of capital and points the way to a major transformation of the world economy.</p></span>",

Keeping the material as self-contained as possible, the author introduces computational finance with a focus on practical implementation in C++. </p><p/><p>Through an approach based on C++ classes and templates, the text highlights the basic principles common to various methods and models while the algorithmic implementation guides readers to a more thorough, hands-on understanding. By moving beyond a purely theoretical treatment to the actual implementation of the models using C++, readers greatly enhance their career opportunities in the field.</p><p/><p>The book also helps readers implement models in a trading or research environment. It presents recipes and extensible code building blocks for some of the most widespread methods in risk management and option pricing.</p><p><em>Web Resource<br/></em>The author’s website provides fully functional C++ code, including additional C++ source files and examples. Although the code is used to illustrate concepts (not as a finished software product), it nevertheless compiles, runs, and deals with full, rather than toy, problems.

    "description": "<span><p><br/>“… a must read for those wanting to craft a vocation in finance.” -- Adrian Gore, CEO, Discovery Group; “… no better book for a student or practitioner who wants more than is usually on offer in finance courses in our universities.”  -- Paul Oslington, Professor of Economics and Dean of Business, Alphacrucis College, Sydney.   To develop a vocation we ask: what do I want to be remembered for? This involves aspiring to personal integrity and a life well lived. Those working in the financial sector fulfill vocations <br/>by finding ways to serve social purposes, to allocate resources efficiently and to provide financial security—while remembering the needy. This means contributing <br/>to institutions, where people can flourish personally and create appropriate products and services. The ethics of those working on finding their vocation do not flow from <br/>rules and obligations, but from a personal commitment to seeking what is good. This life is based on the fundamental personal virtue, integrity. This book is written for those who aspire to the cultivation of the personal virtues of wisdom, self-control, courage, and justice.<br/></p></span>",

Globalization and technological change have ravaged the workforce. Hostile immigration policies actually keep Americans from getting jobs. Our education system is deeply unequal, denying opportunity to millions right from the start. Still, we can't seem to break from the status quo.</p>\n\n<p>In Common Sense, Joel Greenblatt offers an investor's perspective on building an economy that truly works for everyone. With dry and self-deprecating wit, he makes a lively and provocative case for disruptive new approaches-some drawn from personal experience, some from the outside looking in. How do we ensure that all children have an opportunity for a good education? Does getting a college degree have to be a requirement for getting a good job? If we subsidize banks, how do we ensure that the risks and rewards are distributed fairly? Greenblatt shows why expanding an already existing program might help more people than raising the minimum wage, how dramatically increasing immigration would be like giving every American a bonus, and the reason Australia might be the best place to learn about saving for retirement. Not everyone will agree with what Greenblatt has to say-but all of us can benefit from the conversations he aims to start.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><b>Develop the skillset essential to successful securitisation swaps management</b></p><p><i>Securitisation Swaps </i>is a complete practitioner’s guide to this unique and complex class of derivatives. This detailed examination follows the entire life cycle of securitisation swaps to give quants, structurers, traders, originators, issuers and lawyers a common reference for understanding their shared objective. Broad in scope to provide a common-ground perspective — yet detailed enough to promote full understanding — the discussion takes a distinctly cross-disciplinary approach that encompasses the multi-faceted knowledge base required to successfully execute these complex trades.</p><p>Despite the fact that the size of the market is trillions of dollars in notional principal, securitisation swaps have thus far been neglected in both academic and practitioner literature. The numerous stakeholders that work together on these complex deals will all greatly benefit from a thorough understanding of their underlying risks and gain deep insight into the perspectives of each stakeholder. This invaluable guide provides multi-disciplinary insight that allows practitioners to:</p><ul><li>Manage securitisation swaps more effectively, from pre-trade structuring and modelling to post-trade risk management and accounting</li><li>Understand the elements of securitisation and covered bonds, and how swaps mitigate risk in these types of transactions</li><li>Explore how securitisation swaps differ from other derivatives and delve into their three specific risk factors — swap prepayment risk, swap extension risk and downgrade risk</li><li>Learn practical methods and strategies of risk management, accounting, pricing and transaction execution</li></ul><p>When securitisation trades go wrong, they become front-page news — but when each participant understands accurate modelling, risk mitigation, optimal structuring, costs, pricing, commercial backgrounds and other integral practices, they are able to work together to achieve a shared objective. <i>Securitisation Swaps</i> provides the essential knowledge that streamlines and safeguards these important trades.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><b>This book examines the very concept, history, critique, and impact on the overall economy and black money, the move toward less-cash economy and digitalization, government–RBI relations, along with an assessment of two years of demonetization.</b><p>Demonetization has created a severe macroeconomic shock. The measure was humungous in scale and led to a sharp contraction in money supply for a short period. Although demonetization’s proponents have contended that it would cleanse the economy of black money and make transactions more formal and digital, its implementation certainly could have been better. The effects of demonetization on the Indian economy are debatable and will vary by sector. Its effectiveness will be talked about and studied by economists and policy makers for decades to come.</p><p>Demonetization has made only a minor dent in the GDP. It has helped to bring more people into the tax net and has reduced the size of the informal economy. With the increased use of digital payments, economic transactions become recorded. This book examines the very concept, history, critique, and impact on the overall economy and black money, the move toward less-cash economy and digitalization, government–RBI relations, along with an assessment of two years of demonetization. It would be prudent for the government to focus more on proper institutional reforms to address the issues originating from demonetization.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p><b>Who needs investors?</b></p><p>More than two generations ago, the venture capital community - VCs, business angels, incubators and others - convinced the entrepreneurial world that writing business plans and raising venture capital constituted the twin centerpieces of entrepreneurial endeavor. They did so for good reasons: the sometimes astonishing returns they've delivered to their investors and the astonishingly large companies that their ecosystem has created.</p><p>But the vast majority of fast-growing companies never take any venture capital. So where does the money come from to start and grow their companies? From a much more agreeable and hospitable source, their customers. That's exactly what Michael Dell, Bill Gates and Banana Republic's Mel and Patricia Ziegler did to get their companies up and running and turn them into iconic brands.</p><p>In <em>The Customer Funded Business</em>, best-selling author John Mullins uncovers five novel approaches that scrappy and innovative 21st century entrepreneurs working in companies large and small have ingeniously adapted from their predecessors like Dell, Gates, and the Zieglers:</p><li><p>Matchmaker models (Airbnb)</p></li><li><p>Pay-in-advance models (Threadless)</p></li><li><p>Subscription models (TutorVista)</p></li><li><p>Scarcity models (Vente Privee)</p></li><li><p>Service-to-product models (GoViral)</p></li><p>Through the captivating stories of these and other inspiring companies from around the world, Mullins brings to life the five models and identifies the questions that angel or other investors will - and should! - ask of entrepreneurs or corporate innovators seeking to apply them. Drawing on in-depth interviews with entrepreneurs and investors who have actually put these models to use, Mullins goes on to address the key implementation issues that characterize each of the models: when to apply them, how best to apply them, and the pitfalls to watch out for.</p><p>Whether you're an aspiring entrepreneur lacking the start-up capital you need, an early-stage entrepreneur trying to get your cash-starved venture into take-off mode, an intrapreneur seeking funding within an established company, or an angel investor or mentor who supports high-potential ventures, this book offers the most sure-footed path to starting, financing, or growing your venture.</p><p>John Mullins is the author of <em>The New Business Road Test</em> and, with Randy Komisar, the widely acclaimed Getting to Plan B.</p></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p><b>As today's preeminent doomsday investor Mark Spitznagel describes his Daoist and roundabout investment approach, \"one gains by losing and loses by gaining.\" This is Austrian Investing, an archetypal, counterintuitive, and proven approach, gleaned from the 150-year-old Austrian School of economics, that is both timeless and exceedingly timely.</b></p><p>In <em>The Dao of Capital</em>, hedge fund manager and tail-hedging pioneer Mark Spitznagel—with one of the top returns on capital of the financial crisis, as well as over a career—takes us on a gripping, circuitous journey from the Chicago trading pits, over the coniferous boreal forests and canonical strategists from Warring States China to Napoleonic Europe to burgeoning industrial America, to the great economic thinkers of late 19th century Austria. We arrive at his central investment methodology of <em>Austrian Investing</em>, where victory comes not from waging the immediate decisive battle, but rather from the <em>roundabout</em> approach of seeking the intermediate positional advantage (what he calls shi), of aiming at the indirect means rather than directly at the ends. The monumental challenge is in seeing time differently, in a whole new <em>intertemporal</em> dimension, one that is so contrary to our wiring.</p><p>Spitznagel is the first to condense the theories of Ludwig von Mises and his Austrian School of economics into a cohesive and—as Spitznagel has shown—highly effective investment methodology. From identifying the monetary distortions and non-randomness of stock market routs (Spitznagel's bread and butter) to scorned highly-productive assets, in Ron Paul's words from the foreword, Spitznagel \"brings Austrian economics from the ivory tower to the investment portfolio.\"</p><p><em>The Dao of Capital</em> provides a rare and accessible look through the lens of one of today's great investors to discover a profound harmony with the market process—a harmony that is so essential today.</p></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p>This book makes quantitative finance (almost) easy! Its new\nvisual approach makes quantitative finance accessible to a broad\naudience, including those without strong backgrounds in math or\nfinance. Michael Lovelady introduces a simplified but powerful\ntechnique for calculating profit probabilities and graphically\nrepresenting the outcomes. Lovelady's \"pictures\" highlight key\ncharacteristics of structured securities such as the increased\nlikelihood of profits, the level of virtual dividends being\ngenerated, and market risk exposures. After explaining his visual\napproach, he applies it to one of today's hottest investing trends:\nlower-volatility, higher-income strategies. Because of today's\nintense interest in alternative investments and structured\nsecurities, this book reviews their unique advantages to investors,\nmanagers and advisors of retail and institutional portfolios.\n<b><em>Visual Quantitative Finance</em></b> focuses on key topics\ndirectly related to the design, pricing and communication of\nstructured securities, including stochastic price projections and\nthe framework underlying options pricing formulas. The key is\nLovelady's explicit use of probabilities in a spreadsheet format.\nBy working directly with the underlying assumptions, he transforms\nthe Black-Scholes framework into five columns of a simple Excel\nspreadsheet, with no complicated formulas—making structured\nsecurities far more intuitive to design, evaluate and manage.</p><p><em>For all investors, students, and financial professionals who\nare interested in quantitative finance, risk measurement, options\npricing, structured securities, or financial model building - and\nfor everyone who needs to explain these topics to someone else. For\nthose with quantitative backgrounds, this guide offers powerful new\ntools for design and risk management, simplifying the design and\nevaluation of innovative instruments. For everyone else, Lovelady\nmakes the subject comprehensible for the first time</em>.</p></span></span></span>",

Instead of the encyclopedic approach, the text focuses on the two main issues of interest to managers who deal with overseas operations. The first main issue is how uncertain foreign exchange (FX) rate changes affect a firm's ongoing cash flows and equity value, and what can be done about that risk. The second main issue is the estimation of the cost of capital for international operations and the evaluation of overseas investment proposals. Numerous examples of real world companies are used.</p></span>",

Readers will learn how impact investing is different from other strategies, how the organization's mission affects investment decisions and structures, and what to look for in an organization prior to investing. A running example of a village distribution company illustrates the methods and concepts in action, and a full-fledged case study utilizing downloadable professional level analytical tools consolidates all examples into a real-world setting.</p><p>Impact investing is generating significant momentum, but many individuals operating in this space come from alternative backgrounds and lack the knowledge to form a rigorous investment process. Disparate funding sources, immature markets, variations in fund economics, and the need to generate and report social impact all complicate the industry even further, creating a barrier for curious investors. This book is a guide to applying standard investment processes and social impact analyses to impact investing, helping readers:</p><li><p>Adjust standard analysis techniques to suit the particularities of impact investing</p></li><li><p>Discover how social mission influences the entire investment from entry to exit</p></li><li><p>Plan and execute a robust custom impact investment strategy</p></li><li><p>Understand social impact entities and the management of impact investments</p></li><p>Investing with the goal of social impact doesn't remove the need for rigorous investment techniques and diligent processes. <em>Impact Investment: A Practical Guide to Investment Process and Social Impact Analysis</em> is a guide to putting it all together, for a more targeted approach to impact investing.</p></span></span></span></span>",

The veteran business writer Tren Griffin takes the listener through the investment philosophies of VC luminaries such as Bill Gurley of Benchmark Capital, Marc Andreesen and Ben Horowitz of Andreesen Horowitz, and Jenny Lee of GGV Capital to draw out a set of guiding principles that successful businesses follow.</p>\n\n<p>With insight and verve, Griffin argues that venture capital is, at a fundamental level, a service business that depends hugely on \"human factors.\" Griffin suggests that, among a number of common features, these investors succeeded because of their sense of hustle, keen judgment, hard work, and good luck. But most of all, they share a deep love of building businesses that goes beyond financial considerations. Griffin reminds us that success is a multidimensional phenomenon requiring talented people, customer traction, productive partnerships, and brand value. These features amplify one another, with incremental success attracting more attention, talent, and investment.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><b>Ensure Basel III compliance with expert analysis specific to Islamic Finance</b><p><i>Islamic Capital Markets and Products</i> provides a thorough examination of Islamic capital markets (ICM), with particular attention to the products that they offer and the legal and regulatory infrastructure within which they operate. Since Islamic banks act as asset managers, attention is paid to the regulatory challenges which they face in the light of Basel III, as regards both eligible capital and liquidity risk management. The authors of the chapters are professionals and practitioners, and write from experience. The editors also contributed to some of the chapters. </p><p>The markets and products covered include Islamic equities, Islamic investment certificates <i>(Sukūk)</i> which are Shari'ah compliant alternatives to conventional bonds, and Islamic Collective Investment Schemes. The coverage of legal and regulatory issues includes an examination of the implications for ICM of securities laws and regulations and of Basel III, as well as collateralisation issues. Shari'ah compliance aspects, in terms both of the selection criteria for Islamic equities and of the 'purification' of impermissible components of income, are also examined in some detail, as are the implications of Basel III for eligible capital in general and for Shari'ah compliant capital instruments in particular. A similar analysis is also made of the implications of the Basel III requirements for liquidity risk management and high quality liquid assets (HQLA), including Shari'ah compliant HQLA. </p><p>The book concludes with three case studies, two describing the ICM in Malaysia and Bahrain and a third which describes Sukūk issued as Shari'ah compliant capital instruments, followed by brief concluding remarks by the editors.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>In the venture capital (VC) industry, firms often co-invest with other peers in syndicated deals. The process of syndication is a form of investment alliance that generates networks of VC firms and start-up companies. Despite the prominent role played by syndicates, extant entrepreneurship literature found contradicting evidence on the relationship between the practice of syndication and the performance of both the start-up and the investors. In fact, our understanding of the circumstances under which syndicates have the potential to boost performance, rather than hamper them, is still limited. This book intends to fill this gap and explore the performance dynamics surrounding networks in the venture capital industry. The text also provides introductory knowledge to those interested in network studies and methods.</p></span>",

    "title": "Central Counterparties: Mandatory Central Clearing and Initial Margin Requirements for OTC Derivatives",
    "description": "<span><span><span><p>The Global Financial Crisis, from 2007 onwards, illustrated the inherent weaknesses in the global financial system and some of their causes. In particular over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives were blamed by many for partially causing and catalysing the crisis. Not surprisingly, this has led to dramatic action from politicians, policymakers and regulators in relation to OTC derivative markets. Two of the most important changes are the mandatory clearing of standardised OTC derivatives and the requirements for bilateral margin posting in non-standard OTC contracts. Both clearing and margining mandates will be effectively phased in from 2014 and the associated costs will be severe. These regulatory changes are therefore going to create a dramatic shift in the topology of financial markets, together with a significant reallocation of counterparty and systemic risks. Knowledge of the subject is an important consideration for all financial institutions whether they are CCP members, clear trades indirectly or find themselves subject to bilateral margin requirements.</p><p><em>Central Counterparties: Mandatory Clearing and Bilateral Margin Requirements</em> for OTC Derivatives explains the central clearing of OTC derivatives and the associated bilateral margin requirements. The book provides a historical perspective of central clearing as it developed with derivative exchanges in order to mitigate counterparty credit risk. The regulatory requirements (Dodd-Frank, EMIR, Basel III) being imposed since the global financial crisis are defined and discussed. The mechanics of central clearing are described including operational aspects, initial margin and default fund calculations, loss waterfalls and allocation methods. Client clearing is discussed, in particular giving detail on margin segregation and portability methods. An assessment is made throughout of the advantages and disadvantages of clearing and margining requirements, including potential issues such as funding liquidity risk, operational risk and wrong-way risk.</p><p>The book is unique and covers the regulatory requirements together with the practical implementation details and the potential impacts and consequences. It is an invaluable and complete reference guide for any market practitioner, policy maker, academic or student with responsibility or interest in the area of OTC derivatives.</p></span></span></span>",

You’ll learn to create operational and financial models in Excel that describe the workings of your company in quantitative terms and that make it far more likely you will avoid the traps and dead ends many businesses fall into.</p><p>Serial entrepreneur and financial expert <strong>Tom Y. Sawyer</strong> shows how to break your company down into basic functional and operational components that can be modeled. The result is a financial model that, for example, you can literally take to the bank or bring to local angel investors to receive the funding you need to launch your business or a new product. Or it might be a model that shows with startling clarity that your new product development effort is a likely winner—or loser. Even better, you’ll learn to create models that will serve as guideposts for ongoing operations. You’ll always know just where you are financially, and where you need to be. The models you will learn to build in <em/><em>Financial Modeling for </em><em>Business Owners and Entrepreneurs </em>can be used to:</p><li>Raise capital for startup or any stage of growth</li><li>Plan projects and new initiatives</li><li>Make astute business decisions, including go/no-go assessments</li><li>Analyze ROI on your product development and marketing expenditures</li><li>Streamline operations, manage budgets, improve efficiency, and reduce costs</li><li>Value the business when it is time to cash out or merge</li><p>In addition to many valuable exercises and tips for using Excel to model your business, this book contains a combination of practical advice born of hard-won lessons, advanced strategic thought, and the insightful use of hard skills. With a basic knowledge of Excel assumed, it will help you learn to think like an experienced business person who <em>expects</em> to make money on the products or services offered to the public. You’ll discover that the financial model is a key management tool that, if built correctly, provides invaluable assistance every step of the entrepreneurial journey.</p><p>Tom Y. Sawyer has used the principles this book contains to create financial models of numerous startup and early-stage companies, assisting them in planning for and raising the capital that they needed to grow their businesses and ultimately exit with multiples of their initial investment. <em>Financial Modeling for Business Owners and Entrepreneurs</em>, a mini-MBA in entrepreneurship and finance, will show you how you can do the same.</p><p>Note: This book is an updated version of Sawyer's 2009 title, <em>Pro Excel Financial Modeling</em>.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><b>Venture deep into the heart of finance's weird and wonderful paradoxes</b><p><i>Dinosaur Derivatives and Other Trades</i> is an entertaining and compelling tour de force highlighting the paradoxes inherent to the modern financial system. Presented as a series of striking case studies, this book explores certain enigmatic or philosophical puzzles in the finance industry; some of these puzzles may seem slightly absurd at first glance, but all are very relevant to the way finance is conducted in the real world. Each story highlights specific hypocrisies or moral dilemmas that lie at the heart of the system, guiding readers through the challenges of finance by way of innovative and memorable paradigms. Written in clear, accessible language, this book doesn't claim to offer original financial theory or philosophy as such, but instead deepens the reader's understanding of the system and stimulates independent consideration of the current state of affairs.</p><p>The financial world, so often viewed as a rather dull place, is secretly alive with possibilities of strange and sometimes wonderful conundrums. There is the possibility, for instance, of a Manhattan auction house selling derivatives to buy swift-swimming predators known as Megalodons (thought to be extinct for millions of years). This book explores this and other curious propositions to point out the paradoxes of finance.</p><ul><li>Explore the meaning of \"value\" in different contexts</li><li>Learn what the Old Testament can teach us about risk and uncertainty</li><li>Examine an alternative take on the 2007/2008 credit crisis</li><li>Consider how the \"financial innovation\" trend impacts the industry</li></ul><p>To truly understand something, it is necessary to crawl deep into the metaphorical underbelly and have a look around. <i>Dinosaur Derivatives and Other Trades</i> provides the itinerary, and the insightful discussion that stimulates curiosity.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><span><p><b>The financial expert's guide to best practices for litigation services</b></p><p><em>Litigation Services Handbook</em> is the litigation \"bible\" for accountants, economists, and other financial experts. Newly updated to reflect recent rulings and changes in law and procedure, this uniquely useful guide covers all aspects of litigation services, with a focus on investigation throughout. Each chapter is written by an expert in the field, and draws upon their institutional knowledge, experience, and techniques to give you a concrete framework for trial preparation, testimony presentation, deposition, fraud investigation, and more. A wealth of cases illustrates how to prove damages, and gives you real-world insight into the entire litigation process from a financial expert's perspective. The discussion includes Sarbanes-Oxley implementation, new technological tools, and the practical consideration of court appearances.</p><p>The need for financial experts to act as witness and consultant to litigating attorneys is growing faster than litigation itself, and it's important for practitioners offering their services to have a firm grasp of the necessary procedures and expectations surrounding effective financial litigation consultation. This guide provides the most up-to-date case law and best practices financial experts need to know.</p><li><p>Understand the accountant's role in litigation</p></li><li><p>Conduct a thorough investigation that proves damages</p></li><li><p>Present your testimony accurately, thoroughly, and eloquently</p></li><li><p>Maintain authority under direct and cross examination</p></li><p>Twenty years ago, few certified public accountants or economists offered litigation-related services; now, a large number devote their practice to this area. As the practice evolves, so do the procedures, tools, and methods. Comprehensive and up-to-date, <em>Litigation Services Handbook</em> is the indispensable reference that every practitioner needs to succeed in offering litigation support services.</p></span></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p><b>An in-depth explanation of mezzanine finance</b></p><p>Mezzanine finance products, which have grown increasingly popular in recent years, involve a unique and complex form of analysis because of their hybrid nature. Because mezzanine finance involves no collateral, it accentuates legal terms, term sheets, and contracts, in addition to depicting dynamics of both debt and equity. Experienced chairman, lecturer, and professor of investment banking Luc Nijs presents readers with a thorough description of product groups, structuring and pricing, and cultural discrepancies in terms of regulation and application in <em>Mezzanine Financing: Tools, Applications and Total Performance</em>. Nijs analyzes common triumphs and failures encountered in mezzanine financing, and he discusses techniques for risk analysis and risk mitigation. A final study of international capital markets, their products' relevance, attractiveness, and liquidity, and the effects on pure equity/fixed-income risk concludes the book.</p><ul><li><p>Conveys a professional's advice through case studies of various regions, industries and contexts</p></li><li><p>Provides the only complete analysis of mezzanine finance as no other books take on the topic as their only subject</p></li><li><p>Details an increasingly popular and globally relevant subject in finance</p></li></ul><p>Those seeking a detailed explanation of the complexities within mezzanine financing will encounter a professional account in Nijs's book.</p></span></span></span>",

For more than twenty years, until 2004, Timothy Howard was a senior executive at the best known of those companies, Fannie Mae, and he was in the middle of that fight.</p><p>In <i>The Mortgage Wars</i>, Howard explains how seemingly unrelated developments in banking regulation, housing policy, Wall Street financial innovation, and political lobbying all combined to wreak havoc on the American housing market and the world economy.</p><p><b>Timothy Howard</b> was Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of Fannie Mae until 2004. Prior to this, he was senior financial economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span>\n    John Hope Bryant, successful self-made businessman and founder of the nonprofit Operation HOPE, says business and political leaders are ignoring the one force that could truly re-energize the stalled American economy: the poor. If we give poor communities the right tools, policies, and inspiration, he argues, they will be able to lift themselves up into the middle class and become a new generation of customers and entrepreneurs. <br/><br/>Raised in poverty-stricken, gang-infested South Central Los Angeles, Bryant saw firsthand how our institutions have abandoned the poor. He details how business loans, home loans, and financial investments have vanished from their communities. After decades of deprivation, the poor lack bank accounts, decent credit scores, and any real firsthand experience of how a healthy free enterprise system functions. <br/><br/>Bryant radically redefines the meaning of poverty and wealth. (It's not just a question of finances; it's values too.) He exposes why attempts to aid the poor so far have fallen short and offers a way forward: the HOPE Plan, a series of straightforward, actionable steps to build financial literacy and expand opportunity so that the poor can join the middle class. <br/><br/>Fully 70 percent of the American economy is driven by consumer spending, but more and more people have too much month at the end of their money. John Hope Bryant aspires to “expand the philosophy of free enterprise to include all of God's children” and create a thriving economy that works not just for the 1 percent or even the 99 percent but for the 100 percent. This is a free enterprise approach to solving the problem of poverty and raising up a new America.\n  </span>",

Several appendices and videos increase ease of access.</p><p>The second edition includes new coverage of the important issue of how parameter uncertainty can be dealt with in the estimation of portfolio risk, as well as comprehensive new sections on the pricing of CDSs and CDOs, and a chapter on predicting borrower-specific loss given default with regression models. In all, the authors present a host of applications - many of which go beyond standard Excel or VBA usages, for example, how to estimate logit models with maximum likelihood, or how to quickly conduct large-scale Monte Carlo simulations.</p><p>Clearly written with a multitude of practical examples, the new edition of Credit Risk Modeling using Excel and VBA will prove an indispensible resource for anyone working in, studying or researching this important field.</p><p><b>\"The ebook version does not provide access to the companion files\".</b></p></span></span></span>",

    "title": "Good Derivatives: A Story of Financial and Environmental Innovation",
    "description": "<span><span><span><p>Through the eyes of an inventor of new markets, <em>Good Derivatives: A Story of Financial and Environmental Innovation</em> tells the story of how financial innovation – a concept that is misunderstood and under attack - has been a positive force in the last four decades. If properly designed and regulated, these \"good derivatives\" can open vast possibilities to address a variety of global problems. Filled with provocative ideas, fascinating stories, and valuable lessons, it will provide both an insightful interpretation of the last forty years in capital and environmental markets and a vision of world finance for the next forty years.</p><p>As a young economist at the Chicago Board of Trade, Richard Sandor helped create interest rate futures, a development that revolutionized worldwide finance. Later, he pioneered the use of emissions trading to reduce acid rain, one of the most successful environmental programs ever. He will provide unique insights into the process of creating these new financial products. Covering successes and failures, the story describes the tireless process of inventing, educating and creating support for these new inventions in places like Chicago, New York, London, Paris and how it is unfolding today in Mumbai, Shanghai and Beijing.</p><p>The book will tell the story of the creation of the Chicago Climate Exchange and its affiliated exchanges (European Climate Exchange, Chicago Climate Futures Exchange and Tianjin Climate Exchange, located in China). The lessons learned in these markets can play a critical role in effectively addressing global climate change and other pressing environmental issues. The author argues that market-based trading systems are a far more effective means of reducing pollutants than \"command-and-control\". Environmental markets may ultimately help to find solutions to issues such as rainforest destruction, water problems and biodiversity threats.</p><p>Written in an engaging, narrative style, Good Derivatives will be of interest to both practitioners and general readers who want to better understand the creative process of financial innovation. In the middle of so much distrust of markets, it is also a recipe of how transparent, well-regulated markets can be a force for good in the environmental, health, and social areas.</p></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>Incorporates the many tools needed for modeling and pricing in finance and insurance</p><p>Introductory Stochastic Analysis for Finance and Insurance introduces readers to the topics needed to master and use basic stochastic analysis techniques for mathematical finance. The author presents the theories of stochastic processes and stochastic calculus and provides the necessary tools for modeling and pricing in finance and insurance. Practical in focus, the book's emphasis is on application, intuition, and computation, rather than theory.</p><p>Consequently, the text is of interest to graduate students, researchers, and practitioners interested in these areas. While the text is self-contained, an introductory course in probability theory is beneficial to prospective readers.</p><p>This book evolved from the author's experience as an instructor and has been thoroughly classroom-tested. Following an introduction, the author sets forth the fundamental information and tools needed by researchers and practitioners working in the financial and insurance industries:</p><ul><li><p>Overview of Probability Theory</p></li><li><p>Discrete-Time stochastic processes</p></li><li><p>Continuous-time stochastic processes</p></li><li><p>Stochastic calculus: basic topics</p></li></ul><p>The final two chapters, Stochastic Calculus: Advanced Topics and Applications in Insurance, are devoted to more advanced topics. Readers learn the Feynman-Kac formula, the Girsanov's theorem, and complex barrier hitting times distributions. Finally, readers discover how stochastic analysis and principles are applied in practice through two insurance examples: valuation of equity-linked annuities under a stochastic interest rate environment and calculation of reserves for universal life insurance.</p><p>Throughout the text, figures and tables are used to help simplify complex theory and pro-cesses. An extensive bibliography opens up additional avenues of research to specialized topics.</p><p>Ideal for upper-level undergraduate and graduate students, this text is recommended for one-semester courses in stochastic finance and calculus. It is also recommended as a study guide for professionals taking Causality Actuarial Society (CAS) and Society of Actuaries (SOA) actuarial examinations.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><div>A compelling narrative on what went wrong with our financial system—and who’s to blame.<br/><br/>From an award-winning journalist who has been covering the industry for more than a decade, The Devil’s Derivatives charts the untold story of modern financial innovation—how investment banks invented new financial products, how investors across the world were wooed into buying them, how regulators were seduced by the political rewards of easy credit, and how speculators made a killing from the near-meltdown of the financial system.<br/><br/>Author Nicholas Dunbar demystifies the revolution that briefly gave finance the same intellectual respectability as theoretical physics. He explains how bankers worldwide created a secret trillion-dollar machine that delivered cheap mortgages to the masses and riches beyond dreams to the financial innovators.<br/><br/>Fundamental to this saga is how “the people who hated to lose” were persuaded to accept risk by “the people who loved to win.” Why did people come to trust and respect arcane financial tools? Who were the bankers competing to assemble the basic components into increasingly intricate machines? How did this process achieve its own unstoppable momentum—ending in collapse, bailouts, and a public outcry against the giants of finance?<br/><br/>Provocative and intriguing, The Devil’s Derivatives sheds much-needed light on the forces that fueled the most brutal economic downturn since the Great Depression.<br/></div></span>",

This book is a must for any entrepreneur, middle-market company CFO, or graduate student looking for a thorough presentation of real world financial solutions. I highly recommend it.\"</p><p>—Barry D. Yelton, Senior Vice President and Region Manager, Federal National Payables, Inc.</p><p>\"This is a valuable tool to anyone raising capital. I've seen firsthand how the current environment is filled with dead ends for those seeking to grow their business. Having a blueprint for the process will save time and resources; two things any growth company can ill afford to spend. By looking at the process and explaining the various components of how capital forms, the authors provide necessary insight toward a productive effort. Anyone considering a capital raise should embark on that journey with this resource.\"</p><p>—Christopher Gaertner, Head of Technology Investment Banking, Managing Director, Merrill Lynch</p><p>\"All principals involved in financing their growth should keep a copy of this book handy and refer to it frequently for guidance. It provides clear guidelines and case studies that can be used by any of the 27 million firms in the U.S. that want to grow.\"</p><p>—James F. Smith, PhD, Chief Economist, Parsec Financial Management</p><p>\"Ken Marks and team have done a great service here to top management of middle-market companies, their advisors, as well as the investment community in understanding growth financing. This book is a perfect combination of being comprehensive (the glossary alone contains over 650 terms) yet very understandable. Too bad that more books written on this subject aren't written the way this one is.\"</p><p>—Bob Grabill, President and CEO, Chief Executive Network</p><p>\"I am enthusiastic about this Second Edition of The Handbook of Financing Growth. The authors have updated chapters throughout and introduced a very useful, 'new project leadership' tool in Chapter 2. I can't imagine a more complete business financing guide. And, because of the tremendous amount of business wisdom contained herein, this book is valuable for its general business planning guidance alone. Highly recommended; a copy belongs in every entrepreneur's library!\"</p><p>—Peter Pflasterer, entrepreneur and founder, JPS Communications, Inc.</p><p>\"Considering the many financing challenges in the midst of our global recession, as a leading trade association for M&amp;A professionals, we believe the new edition of The Handbook of Financing Growth is essential reading for any business owner, advisor, or investor. This ambitious sharing of 'hands on' experiences will surely prove to be very rewarding for any decision maker in the private capital marketplace today!\"</p><p>—Michael R.

They will lie\nand mislead. They will intimidate. Over the past five years,\nthey’ve racked up more than 300,000 complaints to the Federal\nTrade Commission: more than any other industry regulated by the\nFTC. Financial reporter Fred Williams knows more about the industry\nthan anyone else. Not only has investigated America’s debt\ncollection agencies, he spent three months working for one of the\nlargest firms in the business. In <em>Fight Back Against Unfair Debt\nCollection Practices</em> Williams reveals what he learned and shows\nyou exactly how to fight back and protect your rights. Williams\nweaves indispensable practical advice together with stories\nstraight from his collection agency cubicle. You’ll learn\nwhat to do first if a collector calls; what collectors can and\ncan’t do; which debts you are and aren’t responsible\nfor; how collectors choose accounts to focus on; how to stop\nharassing or abusive calls; how to keep the advantage in a\nnegotiation for a lucrative debt settlement; even how to take the\noffensive with a lawsuit that can halt collection and win yourself\na $1,000 penalty!</p></span></span>",

This volume portrays ALM in practice, in contrast to Volume 1, which addresses the theories and methodologies behind these models. In original articles practitioners and scholars describe and analyze models used in banking, insurance, money management, individual investor financial planning, pension funds, and social security. They put the traditional purpose of ALM, to control interest rate and liquidity risks, into rich and broad-minded frameworks.

    "description": "<span><span><span><p>Activist hedge fund managers represent a small part of the $1.5 trillion hedge fund industry, but their approach is causing a stir among traditional managers and the investment community because they are shaking up the corporate establishment and making money for their investors. These types of managers are here to stay and Extreme Value Hedging tells the story of their rise to power in the U.S. and how they are spreading their influential gospel around the globe to places like China, Ukraine, South Korea and Sweden. Author Ronald D. Orol has a unique understanding of this world and through this book he shares his unparalleled insights in an easy to comprehend manner. He discusses everything from activist investor efforts to breakup the clubby insider world of corporate boardrooms to their deal-making or breaking pressure tactics and courtroom battles. Orol skillfully makes his case for each subject by offering revelations and examples from insiders like Ralph Whitworth, (Relational Investors), Guy Wyser-Pratte, (Wyser-Pratte Management), Mark Schwarz, (Newcastle Capital Group LLC), Robert Chapman (Chapman Capital), Phillip Goldstein (Opportunity Partners), Jeffrey Ubben (ValueAct Capital), Jeffrey M.

    "description": "<span>Featuring a general equilibrium framework that is both cohesive and versatile, the Second Edition of <b>Public Finance: A Normative Theory</b> brings new and updated information to this classic text.  Through its concentration on the microeconomic theory of the public sector in the context of capitalist market economics it addresses the subjects traditionally at the heart of public sector economics, including public good theory, theory of taxation, welfare analysis, externalities, tax incidence, cost benefit analysis, and fiscal federalism.  Its goal of providing a foundation, rather than attempting to present the most recent scholarship in detail, makes this <b>Second Edition</b> both a valuable text and a resource for professionals.<br/><br/>* Second edition provides new and updated information<br/>* Focuses on the heart of public sector economics, including public expenditure theory and policy, tax theory and policy, cost benefit-analysis, and fiscal federalism<br/>* Features a cohesive and versatile general equilibrium framework</span>",

Data vendors such as Reuters transmit more than 275,000 prices per day for foreign exchange spot rates alone. Thus, high-frequency data can be a fundamental object of study, as traders make decisions by observing high-frequency or tick-by-tick data. Yet most studies published in financial literature deal with low frequency, regularly spaced data. For a variety of reasons, high-frequency data are becoming a way for understanding market microstructure. This book discusses the best mathematical models and tools for dealing with such vast amounts of data.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><b>A groundbreaking program to help women create a habit of building wealth—from renowned financial therapist Barbara Huson (formerly Barbara Stanny)</b></p><p>The men in her life had always handled Barbara Huson’s money: First her father (the “R” of H&amp;R Block), and then her husband, a stockbroker who turned out to be a compulsive gambler. When tax bills arrived for over $1m for his illegal deals, her ex left the country, her father refused to help, and Huson—who’d always been “scared and intimidated by money”—realized she had to grow up financially, fast.</p><p>Since that dramatic financial wake-up call, Huson has devoted herself to learning everything there is to know about women and money, and in <i>Rewire for Wealth</i> she goes to the very core of the disconnect between the two: According to multiple studies, women’s and men’s brains process information differently—and that has a profound effect when it comes to money. (Men, for example, view investing as a challenge; women see it as a threat.) Fortunately, you can “un-learn” previous bad lessons—and train your brain to process differently.</p><p>In <i>Rewire for Wealth</i>, Huson offers a proven and integrative approach to re-wiring your brain. Using the latest neuroscience, psychology, and mind-training techniques with original research that includes more than 20 years of hard-won financial expertise, she shows you how to quickly but methodically eliminate maladaptive financial behaviors, and expand your ability to build wealth.</p><p>By repeatedly applying a practical three-step formula—recognize, reframe, and respond differently—old brain circuits become weaker and new ones grow stronger, paving the way to a more confident approach to wealth building. You may never get a financial wake-up call as dramatic as Huson’s, but the real, positive, and life-changing power to take charge, now, is at your fingertips.</p><p><br/></p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>The sports business landscape has changed dramatically in the past two decades. Teams and facilities have become integral parts of the businesses of real estate and development, entertainment, and the media. While an understanding of core financial management issues specific to the sports industry is still mandatory, a greater appreciation of financial and management issues that link teams to the dynamic forces that make it possible to listen or to watch games at home, on the road, or anywhere a fan happens to be is also needed.</p><p><strong>Sports Finance and Management: Real Estate, Entertainment, and the Remaking of the Business</strong> takes an in-depth look at the changes in the sports industry, including the interconnecting financial issues that occur when a sports team becomes a part of bigger companies, the altered nature of fan loyalty influenced by network and Internet footprint, dramatic changes in sports venues driven by the trend for single-purpose stadiums, and league policies such as revenue sharing, luxury taxes, and salary caps. The authors have deliberately not chosen sports examples to teach general finanancial and management concepts. Rather, they use basic financial and management concepts to illsutrate the differences and uniqueness of the sports industry. This gives students tackling finance issues for the first time a firm foundation, while allowing those more expert in financial issus to apply their skills and knowledge to the issues specific to the sports industry.</p><p>Capturing the issues that make the sports industry different from any other, the text examines the effects of public financing, unique pricing structures, and roster depreciation allowances. It includes a detailed treatment of risk measurement based on the monetary value placed on championship wins and the influence fixed rosters have on the investment horizon. These features and more give students the foundation needed to understand finance and management as well as the idiosyncrasies of the sports industry.</p></span>",

Hagstrom breaks new ground with a deep analysis of Buffett's essential wisdom, an intricate mosaic of wide-ranging ideas and insights that Buffett calls a Money Mind.</p>\n\n<p>What exactly is a Money Mind? At one level, it's a way of thinking about major financial issues such as capital allocation. At another level, it summarizes an overall mindset for successfully investing in today's fast-paced stock market, a mindset that depends on a commitment to learning, adapting, and facing down irrelevant noise.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a method book. It is a thinking book. Warren Buffett: Inside the Ultimate Money Mind explains the philosophies of self-reliance, stoicism, rationalism, and pragmatism and their contributions to making intelligent investment decisions. It also outlines the evolution of value investing, discusses how to develop a business-driven investing mindset, and describes the defining traits of successful active management. Lastly, it examines the surprising aspects of a Money Mind-sportsman, teacher, and artist. In short, Warren Buffett: Inside the Ultimate Money Mind helps listeners understand the building blocks that go into making a Money Mind so they can begin to incorporate its principles in the service to a life of value.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>The men in her life had always handled Barbara Huson's money: First her father (the \"R\" of H&R Block), and then her husband, a stockbroker who turned out to be a compulsive gambler. When tax bills arrived for over one million dollars for his illegal deals, her ex left the country, and her father refused to help, Huson realized she had to grow up financially, fast.</p>\n\n<p>Since that dramatic financial wake-up call, Huson has devoted herself to learning everything there is to know about women and money, and in Rewire for Wealth she goes to the very core of the disconnect between the two: According to multiple studies, women's and men's brains process information differently-and that has a profound effect when it comes to money. (Men, for example, view investing as a challenge; women see it as a threat.) Fortunately, you can \"un-learn\" previous bad lessons-and train your brain to process information differently.</p>\n\n<p>In Rewire for Wealth, Huson offers a proven and integrative approach to re-wiring your brain. Using the latest neuroscience, psychology, and mind-training techniques with original research that includes more than twenty years of hard-won financial expertise, she shows you how to quickly but methodically eliminate maladaptive financial behaviors, and expand your ability to build wealth. </p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Asset allocation is the key to investing performance. Unfortunately, no single approach works perfectly-developing the right balance requires a clear-eyed look at the many models available to you, various investing methodologies, and your or your client's level of risk tolerance. And that's where this important guide comes in.  </p>\n\n<p>Written by a leading allocation expert from T. Rowe Price, Beyond Diversification provides the knowledge, insights, and approaches you need to make the best allocation decisions for your goals. This deep dive into the how's and why's of asset allocation is organized by the three decisive components of a successfully allocated portfolio:</p>\n\n<p>- Return Forecasting discusses the desired return investors seek.</p>\n\n<p>- Risk Forecasting covers the level of risk investors are prepared to assume to achieve that return.</p>\n\n<p>- Portfolio Construction calibrates the stock-bond mix that balances the risks and returns.</p>\n\n<p>With examples from T. Rowe Price's asset allocation team showing you how the process works in the real world, Beyond Diversification provides everything you need to find the asset combination that will deliver the results you seek. </p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><b>A <i>Wall Street Journal</i> Bestseller<br/><br/>An insider’s revealing and in-depth examination of Big Tech’s failure to keep its foundational promises and the steps the industry can take to course-correct in order to make a positive impact on the world.</b></p><p><i>Trampled by Unicorns: Big Tech’s Empathy Problem and How to Fix It</i> explores how technology has progressed humanity’s most noble pursuits, while also grappling with the origins of the industry’s destructive empathy deficit and the practical measures Big Tech can take to self-regulate and make it right again. Author Maëlle Gavet examines the tendency for many of Big Tech’s stars to stray from their user-first ideals and make products that actually profoundly damage their customers and ultimately society.</p><p>Offering an account of the world of tech startups in the United States and Europe—from Amazon, Google, and Facebook to Twitter, Airbnb, and Uber (to name a few)—<i>Trampled by Unicorns</i> argues that the causes and consequences of Big Tech’s failures originate from four main sources: the Valley’s cultural insularity, the hyper-growth business model, the sector’s stunning lack of diversity, and a dangerous self-sustaining ecosystem. However, the book is not just an account of how an industry came off the rails, but also a passionate call to action on how to get it back on track.</p><p>Gavet, a leading technology executive and former CEO of Ozon, an executive vice president at Priceline Group, and chief operating officer of Compass, formulates a clear call to action for industry leaders, board members, employees, and consumers/users to drive the change necessary to create better, more sustainable businesses—and the steps Western governments are likely to take should tech leaders fail to do so. Steps that include reformed tax codes, reclassification of platforms as information companies, new labor laws, and algorithmic transparency and oversight.</p><p><i>Trampled by Unicorns’</i> exploration of the promise and dangers of technology is perfect for anyone with an interest in entrepreneurship, tech, and global commerce, and a hope of technology’s all-empowering prospect. An illuminating book full of insights, <i>Trampled by Unicorns</i> describes a realistic path forward, even as it uncovers and explains the errors of the past. As Gavet puts it, “we don’t need less tech, we need more empathetic tech.” And how that crucial distinction can be achieved by the tech companies themselves, driving change as governments actively pave the road ahead.</p></span>",

Written not from a post-crisis perspective – but from a <i>preventative</i> point of view – this book traces the development of financial derivatives from bonds to credit default swaps, and shows how mathematical formulas went beyond pricing to expand their use to the point where they dwarfed the real economy. You'll learn how the deadly allure of their ice-cold beauty has misled generations of economists and investors, and how continued reliance on these formulas can either assist future economic development, or send the global economy into the financial equivalent of a cardiac arrest. </p><p>Rather than rehash tales of post-crisis fallout, this book focuses on preventing the next one.

This updated edition includes new information on backdoor Roth IRAs and ETFs as mainstream buy and hold investments, estate taxes and gifting, plus changes to the laws regarding Traditional and Roth IRAs, and 401k and 403b retirement plans. With warnings and principles both precisely accurate and grandly counterintuitive, the Boglehead authors show how beating the market is a zero-sum game.</p>\n\n<p>Investing can be simple, but it's certainly not simplistic. Over the course of twenty years, the followers of John C.

As the winds change and the tides swell high, the Personal Agility Lighthouse (PALH™) model in this book will guide you to safe shores. Navigating through the seven colors of agility such as education, change, emotional, political, cerebral, learning, and outcomes agilities, the anchor is dropped effortlessly. It is built on these seven competencies, and by using the Individual Personal Agility self-analysis assessment (see Appendix), swaying personal visions leading them up to organizational goals.</p><p>Taking personal agility as the future competency with an agile mindset is a crucial starting point to transform yourself. Focusing your personal agility journey on outcomes and end-to-end customer experiences ensures value delivery. Especially within the elements of the VUCA environment where revised goals are the norm.

The industrial and financial engineering duo has leveraged their respective business turnaround and foot-on-the-gas-pedal backgrounds to thoroughly revamp the contemporary policy–goal deployment methodologies and make determined amendments to reconfigure several management processes in vogue to deliver sustainable business results in a meaningfully restructured leadership–fellowship relationship dynamic replacing the scarcity-driven everyday mill with natural rhythms of abundance.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span>\n    \"Messrs. Gow and Kells have made an invaluable contribution, writing in an amused tone that nevertheless acknowledges the firms' immense power and the seriousness of their neglect of traditional responsibilities. 'The Big Four' will appeal to all those interested in the future of the profession--and of capitalism itself.\" —Jane Gleeson-White, Wall Street Journal<br/><br/>With staffs that are collectively larger than the Russian army and combined revenues of over $130 billion a year, the Big Four accounting firms—Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst &amp; Young, and KPMG—are a keystone of global commerce. But leading scholar Ian Gow and award-winning author Stuart Kells warn that a house of cards may be about to fall.<br/><br/>Stretching back to the Medicis in Renaissance Florence, this book is a fascinating story of wealth, power, and luck. The founders of the Big Four lived surprisingly colorful lives. Samuel Price, for example, married his own niece. Between the world wars, Nicholas Waterhouse collected postage stamps while also hosting decadent parties in his fashionable London home. <br/><br/>All four firms have endured major calamities in recent decades. There have been hundreds of court cases and legal prosecutions for failed audits, tax scandals, and breaches of independence. The firms have come so close to “extinction level events” that regulators have required them to prepare “living wills.” And today, the Big Four face an uncertain future—thanks to their push into China, their vulnerability to digital disruption and competition, and the hazards of providing traditional services in a new era of transparency. <br/><br/>This account of the past, present, and likely future of the Big Four is essential reading for anyone perplexed or fascinated by professional services, working or considering working in the industry, or simply curious about the fate of the global economy.<br/><br/>\n  </span>",

    "description": "<span><p/><p><b>Q. Who should take the lead in fixing market capitalism?<br/>A. Business—not government alone.</b></p><p>The spread of capitalism worldwide has made people wealthier than ever before. But capitalism's future is far from assured. Pandemics, income inequality, resource depletion, mass migrations from poor to rich countries, religious fundamentalism, the misuse of social media, and cyberattacks—these are just a few of the threats to continuing prosperity that we see dominating the headlines every day.</p><p>How can capitalism be sustained? And who should spearhead the effort? Critics turn to government. In their groundbreaking book, <i>Capitalism at Risk</i>, Harvard Business School professors Joseph Bower, Herman Leonard, and Lynn Paine argue that while robust governments must play a role, leadership by business is essential. For enterprising companies—whether large multinationals, established regional players, or small startups—the current threats to market capitalism present important opportunities.</p><p>In this updated and expanded edition of <i>Capitalism at Risk</i>, Bower, Leonard, and Paine set forth a renewed and more urgent call to action. With three additional chapters and a new preface, the authors explain how the eleven original disruptors of the global market system clash with the digital age, and they provide lessons on how to take action. Presenting examples of companies already making a difference, Bower, Leonard, and Paine show how business must serve both as innovator and activist—developing corporate strategies that effect change at the community, national, and international levels.</p><p>Filled with rich insights, this new edition of <i>Capitalism at Risk</i> presents a compelling and constructive vision for the future of market capitalism.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Are profits and sustainability compatible? </p>\n\n<p>This book brings unique perspectives to this key debate by exploring the history of green entrepreneurship since the nineteenth century, and its spread globally in industries including renewable energy, organic food, natural beauty, ecotourism, recycling, architecture, and finance.  </p>\n\n<p>The book uses the lens of the extraordinary and often eccentric men and women who defied convention and imagined that business could help save the planet, rather than consume it. The social and religious beliefs that drove many of these individuals are explored as the book looks at how they overcame huge obstacles to execute their strategies. The green entrepreneurs seen here are shown to have created new markets and industries, and driven innovations in sustainable practices, even at times when most consumers and governments marginalized the entire subject. The struggles of early pioneers appear to have been rewarded by the growth of environmental awareness among consumers, business leaders, and others in recent years, but the Earth's environmental health continues to deteriorate. If profits and sustainability have proved challenging to reconcile, the book argues that one reason was how they were both defined.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span>\n    Farhana Qazi draws on her background as a pioneering counterterrorism professional and a devout Muslim to offer an insider's view of what drives girls and women to join radical Islamic movements and how we can keep them from making this terrible choice.<br/> <br/>The first Muslim woman to work for the US government's Counterterrorism Center, Qazi found herself fascinated, even obsessed, by the phenomenon of female extremists. Why, she wondered, would a girl from Denver join ISIS, a radical movement known for its mistreatment of women? Why would a teenage Iraqi girl strap on a suicide bomb and detonate it?<br/> <br/>From Kashmir to Iraq to Afghanistan to Colorado to London, she discovered women of different backgrounds who all had their own reason for joining these movements. Some were confused, others had been taken advantage of, and some were just as radical and dedicated as their male counterparts. But in each case, Qazi found their choices were driven by a complex interaction of culture, context, and capability that was unique to each woman.<br/> <br/>This book reframes their stories so readers can see these girls and women as they truly are: females exploited by men. Through hearing their voices and sharing their journeys Qazi gained powerful insights not only into what motivated these women but also into the most effective ways to combat terrorism—and about herself as well. “Through them,” Qazi writes, “I discovered intervention strategies that are slowly helping women hold on to faith as they struggle with versions of orthodox Islam polluted by extremist interpretations. And in the process, I discovered a gentle Islam and more about myself as a woman of faith.”\n  </span>",

Money laundering occurs in every country. The significant factor is to diagnose illegal MLAs and apply regulations to mitigate them. To meet this objective, managers of financial instituÂtions need to train their employees about anti-money-laundering proÂcesses and how to diagnose and prevent them. Anti-money-laundering activities can also affect financial systems of a country. MLAs can create a big gap between income classes. Money laundering can also decrease bank's and financial instituÂtion's credibility. This book will be of special interest to financial managers in the priÂvate and public sector and will also be a useful guide for those involved in international financial transactions.</p></span>",

A small group of wealthy investors including Russian oligarchs, English racehorse owners and a former billionaire gold miner have seized the opportunity to enter this booming market.</p><p>Some have moved in on the territory of banks and lent money to clubs in exchange for a share in fees generated by Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar and dozens more of today's stars. Others have acquired obscure teams to get a piece of the pie.</p><p>Even as the global financial crisis sent fortunes tumbling this select group found a profitable place to park their money. The size of the transfer market has continued to rise –- it increased seven-fold in value the last two decades, more than the FTSE share index.</p><p>Between them, these wealthy investors have amassed hundreds of millions of euros in profits. At the same time, they have managed to stay out of the spotlight the world’s most popular sport brings.</p><p>Football’s Secret Trade follows the money along a trail very few know about, from nondescript offices in the U.K. and ramshackle stadiums of South American clubs you have probably never heard of to offshore bank accounts in the Caribbean. Warning – you won’t see a major transfer deal in the same light again. </p></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>Not long ago everyone knew what the word “retirement” meant. The expectation was that you worked until age 65—and then coasted through your golden years courtesy of a comfortable nest egg.</p><p>Today, when living to 90 is common, when savings are slim, when people work longer and change jobs frequently, clinging to an outdated concept of retirement gets you nowhere. The changes ahead require an incremental approach to planning—and you better begin now.</p><p>The new After 50 Lifestyle calls for more than money: it demands conscious engagement, diverse interests, and the ability to adapt. <i><b>How Do I Get There from Here?</b></i> helps you plot your direction for the coming decades. The first step is to acknowledge where you are—reviewing your assets, both the tangible (e.g. finances, health, relationships) and intangible (e.g. unfulfilled ambitions and new intentions). Then self-reflective questions and exercises walk you through imagining your future, identifying skills you'll need, and preparing for inevitable twists and turns along the way.</p><p>A retirement of nonstop leisure is not just unreachable, but for most, undesirable. <i><b>How Do I Get There from Here?</b></i> guides you toward a dynamic future...designed just for you.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span>\n    Young Money<br/>4 Proven Actions to Design Your Wealth While You Still Can<br/><br/>Being young is the ultimate advantage when it comes to building wealth. It may not seem like it when you look at your student loan debt or when the rent comes due, but you have a huge amount of a priceless resource: time. You just need to know what to do with it. Rising-star financial advisor Dasarte Yarnway offers a simple four-step mastery approach anyone can follow to become a Master Wealth Builder. It's a system he himself lives by. <br/><br/>You start by mastering the right mindset, says Yarnway. You need to always remember that you're in it for the long haul—wealth building is a marathon, not a sprint—and keep your eyes and your actions firmly fixed on your wealth-building goals. Then you have to create and master your plan. Yarnway provides advice on avoiding four critical financial pitfalls and a worksheet so you can assess exactly where you are financially, where you want to go, and how you're going to get there. <br/><br/>Once you have a plan, you have to start working that plan by mastering income—Yarnway looks at the three best ways to do that. With income handled, you have to master expenses. Yarnway offers seven simple ways you can control your outflows and discusses how you can minimize your tax burden while still handling your civic duties. <br/><br/>If you start wealth building now instead of ten or twenty years from now, you can experiment, learn from mistakes, bounce back from setbacks, and steadily and consistently build up your legacy. As Yarnway quotes Warren Buffet, “Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree long ago.” The sooner you plant, the more shade you'll have. <br/>\n  </span>",

By focusing on both the asset transactions made by the investment manager for the portfolio and on the transactions in the shares or units of the fund itself, it gives readers insights about the essential elements of investment fund management and administration, regardless of their geographical backgrounds.</p><ul><li>Explores the key stages in the investment process, from setting up a fund through its launch and operation</li><li>Explains the roles of participants as well as the ways regulation affects the fund and its operation</li><li>Describes the work flow associated with custody and administration procedures and processes</li><li>Defines the role of compliance and risk management in the context of the fund and also how compliance requirements apply to custodians and administrators</li></ul></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>Many leaders are unaware of the amazing power of questions. Our conversations may be full of requests and demands, but all too often we are not asking for honest and informative answers, and we don't know how to listen effectively to responses. When leaders start encouraging questions from their teams, however, they begin to see amazing results. Knowing the right questions to ask—and the right way to listen—will give any leader the skills to perform well in any situation, effectively communicate a vision to the team, and achieve lasting success across the organization.</p><p>Thoroughly revised and updated, <em>Leading with Questions</em> will help you encourage participation and teamwork, foster outside-the-box thinking, empower others, build relationships with customers, solve problems, and more. Michael Marquardt reveals how to determine which questions will lead to solutions to even the most challenging issues. He outlines specific techniques of active listening and follow-up, and helps you understand how questions can improve the way you work with individuals, teams, and organizations.</p><p>This new edition of <em>Leading with Questions</em> draws on interviews with thirty leaders, including eight whose stories are new to this edition. These interviews tell stories from a range of countries, including Singapore, Guyana, Korea, and Switzerland, and feature case studies from prominent firms such as DuPont, Alcoa, Novartis, and Cargill. A new chapter on problem-solving will help you apply questions to your toughest situations as a leader, and a new \"Questions for Reflection\" section at the end of each chapter will help you bring Marquardt's message into all of your work as a leader.</p><p>Now more than ever, <em>Leading with Questions</em> is the definitive guide for becoming a stronger leader by identifying—and asking—the right questions.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>According to the health data released by the Organization for<br/>Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the United<br/>States spends more per capita on healthcare than any other<br/>OECD country. Currently, U.S. healthcare spending constitutes<br/>$2.5 trillion, or 17.3 percent of GDP, with healthcare costs increasing<br/>9 percent annually. To reverse this alarming trend, the<br/>Obama administration recently led the effort to dramatically<br/>reform healthcare policy, laws, and regulations.<br/>This book provides you (whether a healthcare policy maker,<br/>hospital administrator, pharmaceutical company manager,<br/>or other healthcare professional) with practical guidance for<br/>leveraging supply chain principles to better manage healthcare<br/>resources and control healthcare costs. It introduces<br/>basic supply chain management concepts, terminologies,<br/>and tenets. Other included topics are strategicalliances<br/>among healthcare partners, value analysis of healthcare services and products,<br/>the impact of healthcare reforms on healthcare supply chains,<br/>and the development of performance metrics for the healthcare<br/>supply chain and benchmarking.</p></span>",

Also looking towards the future, the text provides information on finding ETFs—including fund searches, fund news, measuring and valuing ETFs, evaluating their correlation to the underlying sector or commodity being tracked, and more.

The books is a hands-on resource for family offices and those investors interested in generating returns through private company ownership to be more effective in creating returns in a complex market. Direct investing best practices are explored in-depth, with guidance on strategy and the evaluation and assessment of various investment opportunities. The process begins with a codified and specific investment goal, and a robust strategy tailored to the investor's individual needs.

Research has shown a failure rate of 70 percent in long-term multigenerational wealth management, and contrary to popular assumption, only five percent of that failure is due to bad investment, poor tax planning, or inadequate performance by legal and financial advisors. The number-one reason family wealth management fails is the family itself; poor communication, lack of trust, divergent visions, and a failure to prepare succeeding generations will tear down the resources the family has worked so hard to build. Traditional wealth management cannot fix this. Instead, this book offers a fresh approach that integrates strategic and tactical wealth management to align the family’s assets with the family members.  With helpful tools and advice drawn from a real-world understanding of family complexities, you’ll improve your ability to preserve your family’s resources over multiple generations.</p><p>With an expert’s perspective on the real forces behind successful family wealth management, this book provides a clear model and a practical roadmap for long-term financial preservation.</p><ul><li>Develop a shared family vision and mission</li><li>Improve communication and trust among members</li><li>Merge strategic and tactical planning</li></ul><ul><li>Ensure the longevity of your family’s wealth</li></ul><p>The wealth management sphere tends to focus on taxes, investments, banking, and estate planning, but little thought is given to the people themselves—this overlooks the fact that individual family members are the most critical factor in multigenerational wealth management, and fails to provide solutions. <i>More Than Money</i> merges traditional strategies with family dynamics, communication, governance, and preparation to help your resources last for generations to come.</p></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><span><p><b>Explore the inevitable collapse of the fiat monetary system</b></p><p><em>Paper Money Collapse: The Folly of Elastic Money, Second Edition</em> challenges the mainstream consensus on money and monetary policy. While it is today generally believed that the transition from 'hard' and inflexible commodity money (such as a gold standard) to entirely flexible and potentially unlimited fiat money under national central banks allows for superior economic stability, <em>Paper Money Collapse</em> shows that the opposite is true. Systems of highly elastic and constantly expanding money are not only unnecessary, even for growing economies, they are always extremely destabilizing. Over time, they must lead to substantial imbalances, including excessive levels of debt and distorted asset prices, that will require ever faster money production to sustain. Ultimately, however, there is no alternative to a complete liquidation of these distortions. Based on insights of many renowned economists and in particular of the Austrian School of Economics, the book explains through rigorous logic and in precise language why our system of flexible fiat money is incompatible with a market economy and therefore unsustainable. Paper money systems have always led to economic disintegration—without exception—throughout history. It will not be different for our system and we may be closer to the endgame than many think.</p><p>The updated second edition incorporates:</p><li><p>A new introduction and an extended outlook section that discusses various \"endgames\"</p></li><li><p>Responses to criticisms, alternative views, and a critical assessment of 'solutions'</p></li><li><p>Comments on recent policy trends, including attempts to exit the 'easy money' policy mode</p></li><li><p>An evaluation of new crypto-currency Bitcoin</p></li><p><em>Paper Money Collapse: The Folly of Elastic Money, Second Edition</em> clarifies the problem of paper money clearly and eloquently, and proposes multiple routes to a solution.</p></span></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><span><p><i>Winning at Active Management</i> conducts an in-depth examination of crucial issues facing the investment management industry, and will be a valuable resource for asset managers, institutional consultants, managers of pension and endowment funds, and advisers to individual investors. Bill Priest, Steve Bleiberg and Mike Welhoelter all experienced investment professionals, consider the challenges of managing portfolios through complex markets, as well as managing the cultural and technological complexities of the investment business.</p><p>The book’s initial section highlights the importance of culture within an investment firm – the characteristics of strong cultures, the imperatives of communication and support, and suggestions for leading firms through times of both adversity and prosperity.</p><p>It continues with a thorough discussion of active portfolio management for equities. The ongoing debate over active versus passive management is reviewed in detail, drawing on both financial theory and real-world investing results. The book also contrasts traditional methods of portfolio management, based on accounting metrics and price-earnings ratios, with Epoch Investment Partners’ philosophy of investing on free cash flow and appropriate capital allocation.</p><p><i>Winning at Active Management</i> closes with an inquiry into the crucial and growing role of technology in investing. The authors assert that the most effective portfolio strategies result from neither pure fundamental nor quantitative methods, but instead from thoughtful combinations of analyst and portfolio manager experience and skill with the speed and breadth of quantitative analysis. The authors illustrate the point with an example of an innovative Epoch equity strategy based on economic logic and judgment, but enabled by information technology.</p><p><i>Winning at Active Management</i> also offers important insights into selecting active managers – the market cycle factors that have held back many managers’ performance in recent years, and the difficulty of identifying those firms that truly possess investment skill. Drawing on behavioral economic theory and empirical research, the book makes a convincing case that many active investment managers can and do generate returns superior to those of the broad market.</p></span></span></span></span>",

Now it is thoroughly American; emblematic of Napa Valley, an area idealized as the epicenter of great wines and foods and a cultural tourist destination. But the romanticized accounts you find about it and its denizens is not what you'll encounter in James Conaway's candid book.</p>\n\n<p>Napa at Last Light exposes the often shadowy side of the latter days of Napa Valley-marked by complex personal relationships, immense profits, passionate beliefs, and sometimes desperate struggles to prevail. In the balance hang fortunes and personal relationships made through hard work and, in too many cases, manipulation of laws, people, and institutions.</p>\n\n<p>Napans who grew up trusting in the beneficence of the “vintner” class now confront in the twenty-first century multinational corporations and their allies who have stealthily subsumed the old family landmarks and abandoned the once glorious conviction that agriculture is the highest and best use of the land. Inherent in that conviction is the sanctity of the place, threatened now by a relentless drive for profits at the expense of land, water, and even life.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><span><span><b>Deep insight and candid discussion from one of Wall Street's best investors</b><p><i>Common Stocks and Common Sense </i>provides detailed insight into common stock investing, using a case-study approach based on real-world investments. Author Edgar Wachenheim is the 28-year CEO of Greenhaven Associates, boasting an average annual portfolio comparable to Warren Buffet's. In this book, he shares his knowledge and experiences by providing detailed analyses of actual investments made by himself and other investors. The discussion covers the entire investment process, including the softer, human side, with candid insight into the joys and frustrations, intensities and pressures, and risks and uncertainties. The unique emphasis on behavioral economics and real-world cases set this book apart from the herd—but it's Wachenheim himself and his deeply-examined perspective that elevates the book beyond a mere investing guide.</p><p>Between 1990 and 2014, a typical portfolio managed by Wachenheim enjoyed an average annual return in excess of 18%, achieved using relatively conservative stocks and no financial leverage. As a proponent of evidence and example, his analysis of real cases serve as a valuable education for anyone looking to improve their own investment practices.</p><ul><li>Understand investment through the lens of a Wall Street leader</li><li>Dig into the details of real-world common stock investing</li><li>Learn how to invest creatively and minimize risk</li><li>Go beyond theory to study strategy on a case-by-case basis</li></ul><p>Investment principles and strategies are easy to find—entire libraries have been written about theories and methods and what 'should' happen. But this book goes beyond the typical guide to show you how these ideas are applied in the real world—and what <i>actually</i> happened. Investors seeking real insight, real expertise, and a proven track record will find <i>Common Stocks and Common Sense</i> a uniquely useful resource.</p></span></span></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span>\n    Special-interest money is destroying our democratic process. But now that the Citizens United decision has thrown out campaign spending limits as abridgments of free speech, Americans want to know what they can do about it. Derek Cressman gives us the tools, both intellectual and tactical, to fight back. <br/><br/>There's nothing inherently unconstitutional in limiting the amount of speech, Cressman insists. We do it all the time—for example, cities control when and where demonstrations can take place or how long people can speak at council meetings. Moreover, he argues that while you choose to patronize Fox News, MSNBC, the New York Times, or the Wall Street Journal, political advertising is forced upon you. It's not really free speech at all—it's paid speech. It's not at all what the Founders had in mind when they wrote the First Amendment.<br/><br/>Cressman examines how courts have foiled attempts to limit campaign spending, details what a constitutional amendment limiting paid speech should say, and reveals an overlooked political tool concerned citizens can use to help gain the amendment's passage. Seven times before in our history we have approved constitutional amendments to overturn wrongheaded rulings by the Supreme Court—there's no reason we can't do it again.<br/>\n  </span>",

Based on the idea of \"filtering\", this book lays out a two-step framework involving a Chapman-Kolmogorov prior distribution followed by Bayesian posterior distribution to develop a robust estimation based on all available information. This new second edition includes guidance toward basing estimations on historic option prices instead of stocks, as well as Wiener Chaos Expansions and other spectral approaches. The author's statistical trading strategy has been expanded with more in-depth discussion, and the companion website offers new topical insight, additional models, and extra charts that delve into the profitability of applied model calibration. You'll find a more precise approach to the classical time series and financial econometrics evaluation, with expert advice on turning data into profit.</p><p>Financial markets do not always behave according to a normal bell curve. Skewness creates uncertainty and surprises, and tarnishes trading performance, but it's not going away.

    "description": "<span>\n    We weigh every significant decision based on how it will affect our future. But when it comes to figuring that out, we mostly make the process up as we go along. While financial professional Peter Neuwirth can't help you actually predict the future, he can offer a simple, systematic way to make much better guesses about it—and so make better decisions.<br/><br/>Neuwirth offers an accessible, step-by-step guide to using the powerful concept of Present Value—which allows you to determine the value today of something that might happen in the future—to evaluate all of the outcomes that might arise from choosing one path as opposed to another. Using examples that anyone can relate to, Neuwirth walks you through the process. Your old refrigerator doesn't work as well as it used to—should you buy a new one right away or muddle through for a while? You're offered a great discount on a service you don't need at the moment but eventually will—buy the service now or wait? <br/><br/>With just a little math and some common sense, you can compare future costs and benefits with present costs and benefits and make “apples to apples” comparisons. This book will be indispensable for anyone who has ever had to figure out whether to stick with an awful job or follow his or her bliss, fix that old car or buy a new one, increase 401(k) contributions or keep the same take-home pay, and a thousand other decisions.\n  </span>",

    "title": "The Value of Debt in Retirement: Why Everything You Have Been Told Is Wrong",
    "description": "<span><span><span><span><p><b>Increase the odds you won't run out of money in retirement - using debt!</b></p><p>Conventional wisdom is wrong - being debt free in retirement may actually increase your risk. <em>The Value of Debt in Retirement</em> teaches you how incorporating debt into your retirement strategy may increase your return, lower your taxes and actually lower your risk. You read that right. If handled correctly, debt—that thing we've all been taught to avoid—can play an integral role in your life, especially in retirement. New York Times Best Selling Author and nationally acclaimed financial expert Tom Anderson shows you how to use the time tested strategies of the best companies and the ultra rich to retire comfortably, minimize taxes, buy the things you have always wanted to have and do the things you have always wanted to do.</p><p>Thought provoking and against the grain, Anderson explains why your risk tolerance doesn't matter, why being debt free may actually increase your risk and why rushing to pay off your mortgage may be a financial disaster. Full of shocking revelations and tricks high- net-worth individuals have used for years, The Value of Debt in Retirement opens the world to a new approach to wealth management in retirement, one that factors in both sides of the balance sheet as an integrated ecosystem.</p><p>Real-world case studies illustrate how informed debt strategies can lead to a happier, healthier retirement. See how an individual with a net worth of more than $5 million can spend $20,000 per month - after taxes - and pay less than $5,000 per year in taxes, how it is possible to increase your rate of return by 50%, and how a lower risk portfolio with debt could increase the chances you do not run out of money.</p><p>Specifically written to Baby Boomers, practical guides and checklists show how to use debt strategies to fund primary and secondary properties, refinance credit card debt, and finance hobbies, such as cars and boats and recreational vehicles. Additional guides show how you can help your children, help your parents and leave a bigger legacy for your heirs and favorite charities. Regardless of your net worth, The Value of Debt in Retirement provides tools to use to apply these concepts to your personal situation.</p><p>There is no free lunch: the book delivers a balanced perspective focusing on the potential risks and benefits of the strategies discussed. A discussion on economic history highlights some of the shocks the economy may face and provides important warnings that you should factor into your retirement plan. Anderson not only shows that your life expectancy may be longer than you think, but also illustrates that many investors may be on track to average returns well under 4% for the next ten years - a potentially devastating combination. Irrespective of your beliefs about debt, <em>The Value of Debt in Retirement</em> proves risk is more important than return for retirees and provides suggestions on ways to minimize that risk.</p><p>Not all debt is good and high levels of debt are bad. <em>The Value of Debt in Retirement</em> is about choosing the right debt, in the right amounts, at the right time. Perhaps most importantly, this book isn't for everybody. This book requires responsible actions. If you can't handle the responsibility associated with the ideas then this book then it isn't for you. If you need a rate of return under 3% from your investments then you may not need this book. But if you can handle the responsibility and if you need a return above 3%, this book may offer insights into the best (and potentially only) way to achieve your goals.</p></span></span></span></span>",

The author shows how an 'unreasonable' form of reason has emerged from the separation of reason from emotion, mind from body, nature from culture, public from private, matter from spirit - the dualities that have shaped our vision of modernity. The book argues that men need to explore critically their power and experience which has been rendered invisible by the dominant traditions of social theory. Instead of legislating for others they have to learn to speak more personally for themselves.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>Value investing isn't for everyone. Like practically everything in life, however, you can't know for sure until you’ve tried it and seen how, where, and especially when value investing can get results. Anyone can stumble onto bargains. But knowing whether the companies behind the cheapest stocks and bonds are the genuine articles for the long run is part science and part judgment.</p><p><i>Brandes on Value</i> is your opportunity to experience both sides of the equation. From the time-tested Graham-and-Dodd fundamentals introduced in the 1930s to the contemporary lessons of Japan's lost decades, the financial crisis of 2008-2009 and the rapid globalization of the investment arena, <i>Brandes on Value</i> is a modern take on a classic approach to a timeless discipline.</p><p>Through real-world examples and time-tested perspectives on classic Graham-and-Dodd principles, <i>Brandes on Value: The Independent Investor</i> is more than just a \"how to\" for value investors. It also answers \"how come\" and \"how now\" in the modern investment world--one that is too often distracted by short-term thinking and short-lived trends.</p><p><b>ON MARKET CYCLES</b> and how boom-and-bust speculation lays the foundation for value investing opportunities that are often hidden in plain sight.</p><p><b>ON INVESTOR PSYCHOLOGY</b> and why behavioral biases work against the average investor and in favor of the patient, persistent value strategist.</p><p><b>ON PRODUCT TRENDS</b> and the trappings of old ineffective investments constantly repackaged into new ones.</p><p><b>ON \"MR. MARKET\"</b> and proof that value investing pioneer Ben Graham's bipolar parable is more vocal now than ever.</p><p><b>ON RISK</b> and its misperceptions that lead to costly long-term setbacks for individual and institutional investors.</p><p><b>ON VALUE</b> and why this investment discipline with roots in the 1930s is more relevant and needed than ever before.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>We weigh every significant decision based on how it will affect our future. But when it comes to figuring that out, we mostly make the process up as we go along. While financial professional Peter Neuwirth can't help you actually predict the future, he can offer a simple, systematic way to make much better guesses about it-and so make better decisions.</p>\n\n<p>Neuwirth offers an accessible, step-by-step guide to using the powerful concept of Present Value-which allows you to determine the value today of something that might happen in the future-to evaluate all of the outcomes that might arise from choosing one path as opposed to another. Using examples that anyone can relate to, Neuwirth walks you through the process. Your old refrigerator doesn't work as well as it used to-should you buy a new one right away or muddle through for a while? You're offered a great discount on a service you don't need at the moment but eventually will-buy the service now or wait? </p>\n\n<p>With just a little math and some common sense, you can compare future costs and benefits with present costs and benefits and make “apples to apples” comparisons. This book will be indispensable for anyone who has ever had to figure out whether to stick with an awful job or follow his or her bliss, fix that old car or buy a new one, increase 401(k) contributions or keep the same take-home pay, and a thousand other decisions.</p></span>",

It includes solutions for the challenges of continuing to work and earn money abroad, too.</p><p>As long-time contributors to the acknowledged leader in the field, <em>International Living</em>, authors Suzan Haskins and Dan Prescher have at their disposal more than thirty years of International Living experience and expertise in the topic. They've been writing about living overseas for more than 12 years and have created their own broad and deep body of work, including regular blogs on the topic for Huffington Post and AARP. The authors include information and strategies that can be successfully applied by anyone regardless of their political or economic opinions. For anyone who wants a happier, healthier, more affordable life, The International Living Guide to Retiring Overseas on a Budget shows you how to enjoy the romance and excitement of living abroad on an affordable budget.</p></span></span></span></span>",

Up until now, however, market participants have had to create their own models to analyze these deals, and new entrants have had to learn as they go. Modeling Structured Finance Cash Flows with Microsoft Excel provides readers with the information they need to build a cash flow model for structured finance and securitization deals. Financial professional Keith Allman explains individual functions and formulas, while also explaining the theory behind the spreadsheets. Each chapter begins with a discussion of theory, followed by a section called \"Model Builder,\" in which Allman translates the theory into functions and formulas. In addition, the companion CD-ROM features all of the modeling exercises, as well as a final version of the model that is created in the text.</p><p><b>Note</b>: CD-ROM/DVD and other supplementary materials are not included as part of eBook file.</p></span></span></span>",

    "title": "Durability of Bridge Structures",
    "description": "<span><span><p>On Thursday evening, May 23, 2013, the Interstate 5 Bridge over the Skagit River in Washington state collapsed due to impact by an oversize truck, dumping vehicles and people into the water. Fortunately, the bridge is located in a rural area and nobody was killed in the accident, but three people were rescued after their cars plunged into the frigid water of the Skagit River. According to Washington state officials, the bridge was inspected last year and was not structurally deficient, but collapsed because of apparent impact from an oversize truck. Nevertheless, the collapse of the steel truss bridge renewed appeals for greater investment in the nation’s aging infrastructure. These appeals are echoed throughout the bridge engineering community worldwide, as the condition of deteriorated bridges worsens with increasing traffic loads combined with lack of proper maintenance.</p><p>Bridge engineers from different countries shared their experience toward achieving durable bridge structures, during the 7th New York City Bridge Conference, held on August 26-27, 2013. This book contains select papers that were presented at the conference. These peer-reviewed papers are valuable contributions and of archival quality in bridge engineering.</p></span></span>",

Many retirees or soon-to-be retirees have heard a plethora of advice. Take 100 (or 120) and subtract your age to get your equity allocation, put the rest in bonds or cash. Buy <em>only</em> bonds. Buy <em>only</em> high dividend stocks. Or some combination! Buy equity-indexed annuities or some \"guaranteed\" income product. All examples of a potentially harmful myth many folks believe to be smart, strategic moves.</p><p>Investors believe preparing for retirement requires a radically different set of tools or a dizzying array of products. Navigating the world of retirement products and services can be a full-time job. But investing for retirement is, in practice, not much (if at all) different from investing. In Your Retirement Plan, Ken Fisher will give readers a workable strategy to either develop their own retirement investing plan or work more successfully with a professional to increase the likelihood of achieving long-term goals while avoiding common pitfalls. The book will include easy-to-follow steps like</p><ul><li><p>How to think, correctly, about investing time horizon.</p></li><li><p>How to better figure how much income you need</p></li><li><p>How to determine if a portfolio can provide that income</p></li><li><p>How to figure how much to save each year to achieve retirement goals</p></li><li><p>What pitfalls to avoid</p></li><li><p>And more. . . .</p></li></ul><p>In this retirement planning book that's not just for retirees, Fisher will hand readers the tools and confidence they need to better plan for the future.</p></span></span></span>",

In the new Third Edition of his best-selling\n<b><em>Capitalism at the Crossroads, Third Edition</em>,</b> Stuart\nL. Hart reveals tomorrow’s capitalism. He presents new case\nstudies and practical strategies for building companies that are\nmore sustainable, build deeper roots in their markets, play a\ncentral role in solving social and environmental problems –\n<em>and are far more profitable.</em> Hart helps you identify\nsustainable products and technologies that will drive urgently\nneeded growth and help solve social and environmental problems at\nthe same time. Drawing on his experience consulting with top\ncompanies and NGOs worldwide, he shows how to craft your optimal\nsustainability strategy, and overcome the pitfalls of traditional\n‘greening’ approaches. This edition presents new and\nupdated case studies from the US and beyond, demonstrating\nwhat’s working and what isn’t. It also guides business\nleaders in building an “infrastructure for\nsustainability” – one that can survive budgeting and\nboardrooms, recharging innovation and growth throughout your\nenterprise. Next, in the 5th Anniversary Edition of his classic\n<b><em>The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid</em></b>, C.K.\nPrahalad reveals all that’s been learned about competing and\nprofiting “at the bottom of the pyramid.” Prahalad\noutlines the latest strategies and tactics that companies are\nutilizing to succeed in the developing world. He interviews\ninnovative CEOs to discuss what they’ve learned from their\nown initiatives, including the Unilever business leader who’s\nbuilt a billion-dollar business in India. You’ll find a new\ncase study on Jaipur Rugs’ innovative new global supply\nchain; updates to earlier editions’ key cases; and\nup-to-the-minute information on key industries such as wireless,\nagribusiness, healthcare, consumer goods, and finance. Prahalad\nalso offers an up-to-date assessment of the key questions his ideas\nraised: Is there truly a market? Is there scale? Is there profit?\nIs there innovation? Is this a global opportunity? Five years ago,\nexecutives could <em>hope</em> the answers to these questions would\nbe positive. Now, as Prahalad demonstrates, <em>they can be certain\nof it.</em></p><p><em>From the world-renowned experts in\nsustainable capitalism</em><b>Stuart L.

    "description": "<span><span><p>Today, people struggling with debt have far fewer\noptions: lenders are stingier, which makes it harder to avert\ndisaster, or to recover from setbacks like foreclosure, short\nsales, or bankruptcy. (Meanwhile, people with good credit have more\noptions than ever, including some of the lowest interest rates in\ndecades.) Debtors need an up-to-date guide that can help them\nassess options, find help, discover opportunities, and take action\nthat <em>works</em>. Liz Weston's <b><em>Deal with Your Debt, Updated\nand Revised Edition</em></b> is that guide.</p><p>Most \"conventional wisdom\" about debt is\njust dead wrong. People are told to pay it <em>all</em> off, and live\n<em>forever</em> without it. Doing that can leave them a lot poorer\nin the long run. They're more likely to give up, or pay off the\nwrong debts. They may give themselves too little flexibility to\nsurvive a financial crisis. They could neglect saving for\nretirement. They may even wind up in bankruptcy -- just what\nthey're trying to avoid! For most people, it's more realistic --\nand smarter -- to control and manage debt effectively.</p><p>In <b><em>Your Credit Score: How to Improve\nthe 3-Digit Number That Shapes Your Financial Future, 4/e,</em></b>\nWeston thoroughly covers brand-new laws changing everything from\nhow your credit score can be used to how you can communicate with\ncollectors. This edition also adds:</p><ul><li><p>Simple graphics revealing exactly how much skipped payments,\nbankruptcies, and other actions will lower your scores, and how\nlong it takes to rebound.</p></li><li><p>New information on \"FAKO\" alternative scores.</p></li><li><p>Expanded coverage of the impact of short sales and\nforeclosures, the new FICO 8 Mortgage Score, and deciding when to\n\"walk away\".</p></li><li><p>An all-new chapter on safeguarding against unethical or illegal\nuse of credit scores by employers.</p></li><li><p>Expanded coverage of credit scoring by insurers.</p></li></ul><p> Weston also updates her guidance on\nusing FICO 08 to raise your score… fighting lower limits or\nhigher rates… maintaining the right mix of cards and\nbalances… bouncing back from bad credit… choosing\ncredit \"solutions\" that help, not hurt… and much more!</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p>Discover the best ways to build, protect, and sustain family and\nbusiness wealth across generations! <em>Wealth</em> is the world's\nmost valuable guide to wealth management for individuals, families,\nbusiness owners, and the \"upwardly affluent.\" In the six years\nsince Stuart Lucas first wrote this book, however, the financial\nworld has changed dramatically. Throughout the financial crisis and\nbeyond, Lucas has led the University of Chicago's Private Wealth\nManagement program, teaching more than 500 members of the world's\nwealthiest families. Now, he brings together extraordinary insights\nand constructs informed by this experience. <em>Wealth, Updated and\nRevised Edition</em> retains its core advice, which has been tested\nand proven by the worst financial crisis since the Great\nDepression. However, Lucas has updated his exclusive Strategic\nWealth Management Framework to help even more individuals,\nfamilies, and entrepreneurs aspiring to wealth or seeking to\nprotect it. Lucas highlights key value drivers - family purpose,\nthe economic engine, and leakage management - that mark the\ndifference between family enterprises that succeed for generations\nand those that fail. He offers updated, sage advice on making\nfinancial decisions, evaluating \"expert\" advice, running a family\nbusiness office, tax/estate planning, philanthropy, wealth\npreservation, and more. Since developing a family's human capital\nis the best antidote to Wall Street excess, this edition adds even\nmore robust and actionable guidance for building a culture of\nEntrepreneurial Stewardship: one that enables and encourages all\nfamily members to flourish, and improves the odds that families can\nsustain wealth. <em>This book is for all successful business owners\nand anyone who possesses (or aspires to own) substantial financial\nassets, whether earned or inherited. It will also be of keen\ninterest to investment advisors, business consultants, business\nbrokers, wealth industry practitioners, lawyers, accountants, tax\nadvisors, and others who counsel the wealthy (and upwardly\naffluent) about wealth management.</em></p></span></span></span>",

Every day we are exposed to a barrage of recommendations and mandates from the left and the right concerning what would be the appropriate course of action (or lack thereof) in order to nullify economic ills or to bring prosperity to the country. But what you and everyone needs is a fundamental basic knowledge of money.  This book provides just that. It provides the necessary understanding of money and many of its functions, roles, and uses in economic theories. These theories are essential for the formulation of fiscal and monetary policies. And it is important to understand the meaning of money and be able to differentiate between basic concepts such as consumption, savings, capital, and investment. Would it make any difference, to the overall function of the economy, earnings, employment, etc., if a given sum of money is spent by an individual, a small business, a corporation, or the government? Is it good for the country if people spend money or is it better if they save it? Would it make a difference if spending originates from printing money or citizens’ savings? The answer to these and many other economic questions are at the heart of the fiscal and monetary policy that every government grapples with every day. After reading this book you will be ready to understand fiscal and monetary policies, tools, and their effectiveness.<br/></p></span>",

Personal knowledge capital focuses on the knowledge worker, knowledge creation, and third generation knowledge management. A focus on the ‘inner and outer’ aspects of personal knowledge capital creates a balanced approach in order to produce creative solutions. As such this forms part of a synthesis of mind versus body thinking in relation to knowledge creation theory within knowledge management. This title is divided into two sections: the inner and outer path. The inner path focuses on tacit knowledge in knowledge creation, and highlights the importance of inner value, resulting in a model for personal knowledge awareness. The outer path explores how to effectively communicate and exploit knowledge in a modern business world, both online and offline. This section focuses on valuing intangibles including social capital, relationships and trust, exploring community, conversation, infrastructure and ecologies for a web world.

    "description": "<span><span><span><p>Struggling with debt? Get realistic help that's actually useful,\nfrom Liz Weston, one of the most popular and respected personal\nfinance experts! Today, people struggling with debt have far fewer\noptions: lenders are stingier, which makes it harder to avert\ndisaster, or to recover from setbacks like foreclosure, short\nsales, or bankruptcy. (Meanwhile, people with good credit have more\noptions than ever, including some of the lowest interest rates in\ndecades.) You need an up-to-date guide that can help you assess\noptions, find help, discover opportunities, and take action that\nworks. Liz Weston's <em>Deal with Your Debt, Updated and Revised\nEdition</em> is that guide. Weston reveals why most \"conventional\nwisdom\" about debt is just dead wrong. For most people, it's simply\nimpractical to pay off every dime of debt, and live forever debt\nfree. In fact, doing that can leave you a lot poorer in the long\nrun. You're more likely to give up, or pay off the wrong debts. You\ncould leave yourself too little flexibility to survive a financial\ncrisis. You could neglect saving for retirement. You might even\nwind up in bankruptcy -- just what you're trying to avoid! For most\npeople, it's smarter to control and manage debt effectively. In\nthis extensively updated guide, Weston shows how to do that. You'll\nlearn which debts can actually help build wealth over time, and\nwhich are simply toxic. You'll find up-to-date, real-world\nstrategies for assessing and paying off debt, money-saving insights\non which debts to tackle first, and crucial information about\neverything from debt consolidation loans to credit scores and\ncredit counseling. Weston offers practical guidelines for assessing\nhow much debt is safe -- and compassionate, realistic guidance if\nyou've gone beyond the safety zone. If you've ever worried about\ndebt, you'll find the new edition of <em>Deal with Your Debt</em>\nabsolutely indispensable.</p></span></span></span>",

Barbara Annis, world-renowned expert on gender issues in the workplace, and John Gray, author of the number one relationship book of all time, Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus, team up to resolve the most stressful and confusing challenges facing men and women at work. Annis and Gray reveal, for the first time, survey results of over 100,000 in-depth interviews of men and women executives in over 60 Fortune 500 companies. Listeners will discover the Eight Gender Blind Spots, the false assumptions and opinions men and women have of each other, and in many ways, believe of themselves. Through research, science, and stories, Annis and Gray expose the blind spots that cause our misunderstandings, miscommunications, mistrust, resentment, and frustrations at work. Listeners will discover the biology and social influences that compel men and women to think and act as they do, and direct how they communicate, solve problems, make decisions, resolve conflict, lead others, and deal with stress, enabling them to achieve greater success and satisfaction in their professional and personal lives. Work With Me is the definitive work-life relational guide, filled with \"ah-ha!\" moments and discoveries that will remove the blind spots and enable men and women to work and succeed together.</p></span>",

The challenge lies in being able to step back, reflect, and ask the key questions that are critical to your performance and your organization’s effectiveness. <br/><br/>In <em>What to Ask the Person in the Mirror</em>, HBS professor and business leader Robert Kaplan presents a process for asking the big questions that will enable you to diagnose problems, change course if necessary, and advance your career. He lays out areas of inquiry, including questions such as: <br/><br/>•Do I clearly articulate my vision and top priorities to my employees and key constituencies? <br/>•Does the way I spend my time enable me to achieve my top priorities? <br/>•Do I give subordinates timely and direct feedback they can act on? Do I actively seek feedback myself?<br/>•Have I developed a succession roadmap?<br/>•Is my organization’s design aligned with the achievement of its objectives? <br/>•Is my leadership style still effective, and does it reflect who I truly am?<br/><br/>Packed with real-life situations, this highly readable and practical guide helps you learn to ask the right questions—and work through the answers in ways that are right for <em>you</em>. By asking these questions, you can tackle the inevitable challenges of leadership as you craft new strategies for staying on top of your game.</div></span>",

    "title": "The Financial Domino Effect: How to Profit Now in the Volatile Global Economy",
    "description": "<span><span><p><b>Predict and profit from the chain reactions of market turmoil</b></p><p>“If you care about the inner dynamics and investors’ reactions to the emerging new financial world that will increasingly consist of ‘path-dependent, multimodal, fat-tailed outcomes,’ Ben Emons’s new book is a must-read. In a coherent and clear framework, Ben shows how falling dominoes in a world of fast markets and uniquely new possibili¬ties creates a market landscape we might never have prepared for.”<br/><b>—Vineer Bhansali, Managing Director, Portfolio Manager, PIMCO</b></p><p>“At some point after getting your financial life in order, you may well have money to invest. Where should you put it, especially when worldwide markets are in flux? Ben Emons, a senior vice president at Pimco, the investment company that runs the world’s largest bond fund, addresses that question in <i>The Financial Domino Effect</i>.”<br/><b>—<i>The New York Times</i></b></p><p>“A great book; it’s a very smart book. This is not general reading but it’s something accessible to anyone.\"<br/><b>—Tom Keene, Bloommberg Radio</b></p><p>When a major political or financial event happens, the impact disseminates like a contagion across markets and sovereign boundaries. Like a row of toppling dominoes, the effect of the crisis accelerates along various paths. <i>The Financial Domino Effect</i> enables you to benefit from these moving catastrophes and helps you navigate current changes taking place in governmental and financial systems.</p><p>At the heart of this progressive book is a powerful framework for analyzing and interpreting the variety of connected influences in the three main domino effects categories—social-political, economic, and financial. By examining the aftermath of such recent milestone events as the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the Occupy Wall Street movement, and the Middle East protests, it shows you how to apply domino theory to become a more knowledgeable and astute portfolio manager. Written with the everyday inves¬tor in mind, this hands-on resource takes you to the next level by delving into such consequential topics as:</p><li>How easily complex domino effects can become and what it means to your portfolio</li><li>Six symptoms in the aftermath of a financial or sovereign crisis</li><li>Post–financial crisis responses, such as quantitative easing (QE), credit easing, and competitive quantitative easing (CQE)</li><li>How the dissemination and speed of domino effects relate to monetary transmission <p>The second part of the book goes into great depth examining the euro zone debt crisis through the framework. This crisis is particularly unique because it is a domino effect of three kinds—social, economic, and financial—and it has not fully played out. This timely guide takes you step by step through the crisis to a final analysis. In the end, you will be prepared to plan for the myriad of far-reaching consequences and balance your portfolio.</p>\n\n<p>Financial crises will happen with high frequency. <i>The Financial Domino Effect</i> helps you stay on top when it all goes down.</p>\n\n</li></span></span>",

When they ask, people answer. When they lead, people follow. Personal presence can help you get a date, a mate, a job, or a sale. It can help you lead a meeting, a movement, or an organization.<br/><br/>Presence is not something you're born with—anyone can learn these skills, habits, and traits. Award-winning speaker and consultant Dianna Booher shows how to master dozens of small and significant things that work together to convey presence. She details how body language, manners, and even your surroundings enhance credibility and build rapport. You'll learn to use voice and language to demonstrate competence, deliver clear and memorable messages, and master emotions. You'll learn to think strategically, organize ideas coherently, and convey to others genuine interest, integrity, respect, and reliability. <br/><br/>Take her self-assessment to measure your progress. With Dianna Booher's expert, entertaining advice, you can have the same kind of influence as the most successful CEOs, celebrities, and civic leaders.<br/><br/>\n  </span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p><b>The case for the inevitable failure of a paper money economy and what that means for the future</b></p><p>All paper money systems in history have ended in failure. Either they collapsed in chaos, or society returned to commodity money before that could happen. Drawing upon novel new research, <em>Paper Money Collapse</em> conclusively illustrates why paper money systems—those based on an elastic and constantly expanding supply of money as opposed to a system of commodity money of essentially fixed supply—are inherently unstable and why they must lead to economic disintegration.</p><p>These highly controversial conclusions clash with the present consensus, which holds that elastic state money is superior to inflexible commodity money (such as a gold standard), and that expanding money is harmless or even beneficial for as long as inflation stays low. Contradicting this, <em>Paper Money Collapse</em> shows that:</p><ul><li><p>The present crisis is the unavoidable result of continuously expanding fiat money</p></li><li><p>The current policy of accelerated money production to \"stimulate\" the economy is counterproductive and could lead to a complete collapse of the monetary system</p></li><li><p>Why many in financial markets, in media, and in the policy establishment are unable (and often unwilling) to fully appreciate the underlying problems with elastic money</p></li></ul><p>This compelling new book looks at the breakdown of modern economic theory and the fallacy of mathematical models. It is an analysis of the current financial crisis and shows in very stark terms that the solutions presented by paper money-enthusiasts around the world are misguided and inherently flawed.</p></span></span></span>",

You are deluged with \"facts\" presented as certainty: China will be the number one economy.

Emerging markets are therefore a sure bet for making money and should be part of every portfolio.</p><p>But is it true?</p><p>Emerging markets undoubtedly present one of the most exciting investment opportunities that has occurred over the last twenty years. But so was the U.S. housing market—if you knew when to get in and get out. Emerging markets are no different. To understand them you have to understand that they are different. You have to understand that you are not on Wall Street anymore. Different rules apply. And there are not only vast differences between developed and emerging markets, but vast differences among emerging markets themselves. The opportunities and risks are substantial and vary enormously between countries. <em>Investing in Emerging Markets</em> will help the retail investor, the more sophisticated money manager, and the prospective international businessperson to get beyond the hype, the marketing, and the dreams to understand the real risks and to take advantage of the real opportunities.

    "description": "<span><p>Every day, we make decisions on topics ranging from personal investments to schools for our children to the meals we eat to the causes we champion. Unfortunately, we often choose poorly. The reason, the authors explain, is that, being human, we are all susceptible to various biases that can lead us to blunder. Our mistakes make us poorer and less healthy; we often make bad decisions involving education, personal finance, health care, mortgages and credit cards, the family, and even the planet itself.<br> <br>Thaler and Sunstein invite us to enter an alternative world, one that takes our humanness as a given. They show that by knowing how people think, we can design choice environments that make it easier for people to choose what is best for themselves, their families, and their society. Using colorful examples from the most important aspects of life, Thaler and Sunstein demonstrate how thoughtful “choice architecture” can be established to nudge us in beneficial directions without restricting freedom of choice. Nudge offers a unique new take-from neither the left nor the right-on many hot-button issues, for individuals and governments alike. This is one of the most engaging and provocative audio books to come along in many years.<br>Included in this recording are a Bonus Chapter and a Postscript added in the Paperback Edition.<br></p></span>",

This is a very timely and useful book.”<br/><b>—Ned Davis, Senior Investment Strategist, Ned Davis Research, Inc.</b></p><p>“Dick Stoken’s <i>Survival of the Fittest for Investors</i> is a masterful and unique dissection of what makes the market tick.

    "description": "<span><span><p>“Once upon a time...”</p><p>Do those words call up an image for you? A\nfantasy, perhaps, of a fairy tale  with a well deserved happy\nending? If so, you’re not alone. Most of us as children heard\nfairy tales from our parents. We saw the movies. We read the books.\nThose stories all had lessons, some more obvious and some quite\nsubtle. As children, we had our own unique ways of interpreting\nwhat these lessons meant to us.</p><p>Well, we’re adults now, and it’s\nour turn to read the stories to our kids. Have you ever stopped to\nthink about what the lessons mean to you now? Many of the teachings\nstill apply, but in more complex ways than we may have previously\nconsidered.</p><p>Nowhere is this truer than in your financial\nlife. Take for instance, the story of “The Emperor’s\nNew Clothes.”</p><p>When it comes to money, too many of us\nbehave like the protagonist in “The Emperor’s New\nClothes”: We’re somewhat self-satisfied about our\ninvestment abilities, only to be exposed as financially\n“naked” when the actual results arrive. Now, renowned\nfinancial advisor Saly A. Glassman shows how to recognize when\nyou’re deceiving yourself (or when others are trying to\ninfluence you)—and offers the common-sense techniques you\nneed to build real wealth over time. Glassman demonstrates why\ndiversification offers even more benefits now than it did\nbefore…how to avoid getting enticed by “magic\nbullet” solutions like gold or real estate…how to\nimplement safeguards that reduce your risk of making common\ninvestment mistakes…how to avoid going broke while\nyou’re reducing debt…how to manage the twin emotions of\ngreed and fear that bedevil investors…how to gain the courage\nto face the truth—and use that knowledge to build on the\npotential for long-term financial security.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>The human race created money and finance. But our inventions re-create us. Mankind mistook moneya lubricant of society and human well-beingfor an end in itself. Finance, the monetary shadow of real things, came to dominate human reality. Extreme Money tells the story of how this happenedand, in so doing, it tells the story of the modern world.</p><p><br/>Bestselling author Satyajit Das draws on 33 years of personal experience at the heart of modern global finance to narrate this story. Das reveals the spectacular, dangerous money games that have generated increasingly massive bubbles of fake growth, Ponzi prosperity, sophistication, and wealthwhile endangering the jobs, possessions, and futures of virtually everyone outside the financial industry.  Das shows how extreme money has become ever more unreal; how voodoo banking continues to generate massive phony profits even now; and how a new generation of Masters of the Universe has come to dominate the world.</p><p> </p><p>Extreme Money is about:<br/><strong>The new financial fundamentalism: false gods, false prophets - </strong>Faith in money, faith in risk, faith in shadows<br/><strong>The cult of risk and the growth engine that isnt - </strong>How financial engineering replaced real engineering and illusions replaced reality<br/><strong>Financial alchemy and the Doomsday Debt Machine- </strong>The rise of the global financial machine we cannot escape<br/><strong>The new global oligarchyand the nihilistic games they pla</strong>y - Too smart, too fast, too greedy, too self-absorbedand far too dangerous</p><p> </p></span>",
