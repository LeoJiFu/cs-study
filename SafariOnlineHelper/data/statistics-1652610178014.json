But many people use data in ways they don’t even understand, meaning they aren’t getting the most from it. <i>Bayesian Statistics the Fun Way</i> will change that.</p><p>This book will give you a complete understanding of Bayesian statistics through simple explanations and un-boring examples. Find out the probability of UFOs landing in your garden, how likely Han Solo is to survive a flight through an asteroid belt, how to win an argument about conspiracy theories, and whether a burglary really was a burglary, to name a few examples.</p><p>By using these off-the-beaten-track examples, the author actually makes learning statistics fun. And you’ll learn real skills, like how to:</p><p>•How to measure your own level of uncertainty in a conclusion or belief•Calculate Bayes theorem and understand what it’s useful for•Find the posterior, likelihood, and prior to check the accuracy of your conclusions•Calculate distributions to see the range of your data•Compare hypotheses and draw reliable conclusions from them</p><p>Next time you find yourself with a sheaf of survey results and no idea what to do with them, turn to <i>Bayesian Statistics the Fun Way</i> to get the most value from your data.</p></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>Need to learn statistics as part of your job, or want some help passing a statistics course? <em>Statistics in a Nutshell</em> is a clear and concise introduction and reference that's perfect for anyone with no previous background in the subject. This book gives you a solid understanding of statistics without being too simple, yet without the numbing complexity of most college texts.<br/><br/>You get a firm grasp of the fundamentals and a hands-on understanding of how to apply them before moving on to the more advanced material that follows. Each chapter presents you with easy-to-follow descriptions illustrated by graphics, formulas, and plenty of solved examples. Before you know it, you'll learn to apply statistical reasoning and statistical techniques, from basic concepts of probability and hypothesis testing to multivariate analysis. <br/><br/>Organized into four distinct sections, <em>Statistics in a Nutshell</em> offers you:<br/><br/></p><ul><b>Introductory material:</b><li>Different ways to think about statistics</li><li>Basic concepts of measurement and probability theory</li><li>Data management for statistical analysis</li><li>Research design and experimental design</li><li>How to critique statistics presented by others</li><br/><br/><b>Basic inferential statistics:</b><li>Basic concepts of inferential statistics</li><li>The concept of correlation, when it is and is not an appropriate measure of association</li><li>Dichotomous and categorical data</li><li>The distinction between parametric and nonparametric statistics</li><br/><br/><b>Advanced inferential techniques:</b><li>The General Linear Model</li><li>Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and MANOVA</li><li>Multiple linear regression</li><br/><br/><b>Specialized techniques:</b><li>Business and quality improvement statistics</li><li>Medical and public health statistics</li><li>Educational and psychological statistics</li></ul><p>Unlike many introductory books on the subject, <em>Statistics in a Nutshell</em> doesn't omit important material in an effort to dumb it down. And this book is far more practical than most college texts, which tend to over-emphasize calculation without teaching you when and how to apply different statistical tests.<br/><br/>With <em>Statistics in a Nutshell</em>, you learn how to perform most common statistical analyses, and understand statistical techniques presented in research articles. If you need to know how to use a wide range of statistical techniques without getting in over your head, this is the book you want.</p></div></span></span>",

    "title": "Statistical Analysis Using Excel LiveLessons (Video Training)",
    "description": "<span><p><p>Most statistical writing is vague and abstract; these videos make the concepts concrete using Excel charts, tools, and functions. Statistical analysis takes two main forms: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics provide numbers that describe how values cluster together (averages), disperse (standard deviations), and vary together (correlations). Inferential statistics informs us regarding the probability that the descriptive statistics that we calculate from samples are accurate estimators of the populations from which we took the samples. These techniques are well worked out in theory and in applications such as Microsoft Excel. They have applicability in fields as diverse as politics and sports, as economics and agriculture, as psychology and business management, as achievement testing and manufacturing.</p><p>This tutorial on statistical analysis is designed to provide conceptual overviews of topics such as testing the reliability of the difference between the means of a treatment group and a control group, followed by demonstrations of how to handle the topic in Excel. Topics such as statistical power are crucial to understanding inferential analysis but history shows that they are very difficult to communicate through text. By using auditory explanations in combination with Excel's powerful charting capabilities, it’s possible to communicate these abstract notions in a concrete fashion. Students and other consumers of this sort of information find it much easier to follow, and much faster to assimilate.</p><p><b>About the Author:</b></p><p>Conrad Carlberg has a doctorate in statistics from the University of Colorado, Boulder and studied under one of the foremost statisticians of the last century, Gene Glass. he is a multi-time recipient of Microsoft's MVP/Excel award, and has written somewhere around 15 books on Excel, including one originally published in 1995 and now in its 4th edition. Conrad's book Predictive Analytics: Microsoft Excel 2010 was published in July 2012.</p></p></span>",

He authored the book <em><a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-learning-illustrated/9780135116821/\">Deep Learning Illustrated</a></em>, an instant #1 bestseller that has been translated into six languages. Jon is renowned for his compelling lectures, which he offers in person at Columbia University and New York University, as well as online via O'Reilly, YouTube, and the <em>SuperDataScience</em> podcast. Jon holds a PhD from Oxford and has been publishing on machine learning in leading academic journals since 2010; his papers have been cited over a thousand times.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Skill Level</strong><br/>\n<ul><li>Intermediate</li></ul>\n<br/>\n<strong>Learn How To</strong><br/>\n<ul><li>Understand the appropriate variable type and probability distribution for representing a given class of data</li><li>Calculate all of the standard summary metrics for describing probability distributions, as well as the standard techniques for assessing the relationships between distributions</li><li>Apply information theory to quantify the proportion of valuable signal that's present among the noise of a given probability distribution</li><li>Hypothesize about and critically evaluate the inputs and outputs of machine learning algorithms using essential statistical tools such as the <em>t</em>-test, ANOVA, and R-squared</li><li>Understand the fundamentals of both frequentist and Bayesian statistics, as well as appreciate when one of these approaches is appropriate for the problem you're solving</li><li>Use historical data to predict the future using regression models that take advantage of frequentist statistical theory (for smaller data sets) and modern machine learning theory (for larger data sets), including why we may want to consider applying deep learning to a given problem</li><li>Develop a deep understanding of what's going on beneath the hood of predictive statistical models and machine learning algorithms</li></ul>\n<br/>\n<strong>Who Should Take This Course</strong><br/>\n<ul><li>You use high-level software libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, Keras, TensorFlow) to train or deploy machine learning algorithms and would now like to understand the fundamentals underlying the abstractions, enabling you to expand your capabilities</li><li>You're a software developer who would like to develop a firm foundation for the deployment of machine learning algorithms into production systems</li><li>You're a data scientist who would like to reinforce your understanding of the subjects at the core of your professional discipline</li><li>You're a data analyst or AI enthusiast who would like to become a data scientist or data/ML engineer, and so you're keen to deeply understand the field you're entering from the ground up (very wise of you!)</li></ul>\n<br/>\n<strong>Course Requirements</strong><br/>\n<ul><li>Mathematics: Familiarity with secondary school-level mathematics will make it easier for you to follow along with the class. If you are comfortable dealing with quantitative information--such as understanding charts and rearranging simple equations--then you should be well-prepared to follow along with all of the mathematics.</li><li>Programming: All code demos will be in Python so experience with it or another object-oriented programming language would be helpful for following along with the hands-on examples.</li></ul>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson Descriptions</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 1: Introduction to Probability</strong> <br/>\nIn Lesson 1, Jon starts by orienting you to the machine learning foundations series and covering what probability theory is. He then begins coverage of the most essential probability concepts, which is reinforced by comprehension exercises. The lesson ends with a comparison of Bayesian and frequentist statistics, as well as a discussion of applications of probability to machine learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 2: Random Variables</strong> <br/>\nLesson 2 focuses on random variables, a fundamental probability concept that is a prerequisite for understanding the later lessons. Jon starts off with an exploration of discrete and continuous variables as well as the probability distributions to which they correspond. The lesson wraps up with calculation of the expected value of random variables.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 3: Describing Distributions</strong><br/>\nLesson 3 is all about metrics for describing probability distributions. Jon covers measures of central tendency, quantiles, box-and-whisker plots, measures of dispersion, and measures of relatedness.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 4: Relationships Between Probabilities</strong><br/>\nIn Lesson 4, Jon explores the core relationships between probabilities, including joint distributions, marginal and conditional probabilities, the chain rule, and independence.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 5: Distributions in Machine Learning</strong> <br/>\nHaving now led you through mastering probability theory in general, in Lesson 5 Jon details the most important probability distributions in machine learning, including the uniform and normal distributions, as well as the critical concept of the central limit theorem. He also covers the log-normal, exponential, discrete, and Poisson distributions, as well as mixtures of distributions and how to prepare distributions for input into a machine learning model.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 6: Information Theory</strong><br/>\nIn Lesson 6, Jon provides you with an introduction to information theory, a field of study related to probability theory that includes some key concepts that are ubiquitous in machine learning. Specifically, he defines self-information, Shannon entropy, KL divergence, and cross-entropy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 7: Introduction to Statistics</strong> <br/>\nFrom Lesson 7 onward, Jon shifts gears from general probability theory to the statistical models that probability theory facilitates. He starts by explaining how statistics are applied to machine learning and reviewing the most essential probability theory you absolutely must know to move forward. He then introduces new statistics concepts, specifically <em>z</em>-scores and <em>p</em>-values.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 8: Comparing Means</strong><br/>\nIn Lesson 8, Jon teaches you to use probability and statistics to compare distributions with <em>t</em>-tests. He covers all the critical types, including the single-sample, independent, and paired varieties. Jon provides specific applications of <em>t</em>-tests to machine learning, and then wraps the lesson up with a discussion of related concepts, namely, confidence intervals and analysis of variance.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 9: Correlation</strong><br/>\nLesson 9 builds on the introduction to correlation in Lesson 3. You are now armed with enough statistical knowledge to calculate p-values for correlations and calculate the coefficient of determination. Jon finishes off the lesson with important discussions about inferring causation and correcting for multiple comparisons.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 10: Regression</strong><br/>\nYou're in for a treat with Lesson 10, which brings together the preceding lessons with practical, real-world demonstrations of regression--a powerful, highly extensible approach to making predictions. Jon distinguishes independent from dependent variables and uses linear regression to predict continuous variables--first with a single model feature and then with many, including discrete features. The lesson concludes with logistic regression for predicting discrete outcomes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 11: Bayesian Statistics</strong><br/>\nLesson 11 is on Bayesian statistics. Jon provides a guide as to when frequentist statistics or Bayesian statistics might be the appropriate option for the problem you're solving. Jon then introduces the most essential Bayesian concepts. Finally, Jon leaves you with resources for studying probability and statistics beyond what we had time for in these LiveLessons themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Notebooks are available at <a href=\"https://github.com/jonkrohn/ML-foundations\">github.com/jonkrohn/ML-foundations</a></em><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>About Pearson Video Training</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n  Pearson publishes expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

Reflecting the need for even minor \nprogramming in today’s model-based statistics, the book pushes readers to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that readers understand \nenough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in their own modeling work.</p><p>The text presents generalized linear multilevel models from a Bayesian perspective, relying on a simple logical interpretation of Bayesian probability and maximum entropy. It covers from the basics \nof regression to multilevel models. The author also discusses measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and network autocorrelation.</p><p>By using complete R code examples throughout, this book provides a practical foundation for performing statistical inference. Designed for both PhD students and seasoned professionals in the natural \nand social sciences, it prepares them for more advanced or specialized statistical modeling.</p><p><em><strong>Web Resource</strong><br/></em>The book is accompanied by an R package (rethinking) that is available on the author’s website and GitHub. The two core functions (map and map2stan) of this package allow a variety of statistical \nmodels to be constructed from standard model formulas.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><span><p><b><em>A concise, easily accessible introduction to descriptive and inferential techniques</em></b></p><p><em>Statistical Inference: A Short Course</em> offers a concise presentation of the essentials of basic statistics for readers seeking to acquire a working knowledge of statistical concepts, measures, and procedures.</p><p>The author conducts tests on the assumption of randomness and normality, provides nonparametric methods when parametric approaches might not work. The book also explores how to determine a confidence interval for a population median while also providing coverage of ratio estimation, randomness, and causality. To ensure a thorough understanding of all key concepts, Statistical Inference provides numerous examples and solutions along with complete and precise answers to many fundamental questions, including:</p><li><p>How do we determine that a given dataset is actually a random sample?</p></li><li><p>With what level of precision and reliability can a population sample be estimated?</p></li><li><p>How are probabilities determined and are they the same thing as odds?</p></li><li><p>How can we predict the level of one variable from that of another?</p></li><li><p>What is the strength of the relationship between two variables?</p></li><p>The book is organized to present fundamental statistical concepts first, with later chapters exploring more advanced topics and additional statistical tests such as Distributional Hypotheses, Multinomial Chi-Square Statistics, and the Chi-Square Distribution. Each chapter includes appendices and exercises, allowing readers to test their comprehension of the presented material.</p><p><em>Statistical Inference: A Short Course</em> is an excellent book for courses on probability, mathematical statistics, and statistical inference at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. The book also serves as a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners who would like to develop further insights into essential statistical tools.</p></span></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p><b>This book bridges the latest software applications with the benefits of modern resampling techniques</b></p><p>Resampling helps students understand the meaning of sampling distributions, sampling variability, P-values, hypothesis tests, and confidence intervals. This groundbreaking book shows how to apply modern resampling techniques to mathematical statistics. Extensively class-tested to ensure an accessible presentation, <em>Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R</em> utilizes the powerful and flexible computer language R to underscore the significance and benefits of modern resampling techniques.</p><p>The book begins by introducing permutation tests and bootstrap methods, motivating classical inference methods. Striking a balance between theory, computing, and applications, the authors explore additional topics such as:</p><ul><li><p>Exploratory data analysis</p></li><li><p>Calculation of sampling distributions</p></li><li><p>The Central Limit Theorem</p></li><li><p>Monte Carlo sampling</p></li><li><p>Maximum likelihood estimation and properties of estimators</p></li><li><p>Confidence intervals and hypothesis tests</p></li><li><p>Regression</p></li><li><p>Bayesian methods</p></li></ul><p>Throughout the book, case studies on diverse subjects such as flight delays, birth weights of babies, and telephone company repair times illustrate the relevance of the real-world applications of the discussed material. Key definitions and theorems of important probability distributions are collected at the end of the book, and a related website is also available, featuring additional material including data sets, R scripts, and helpful teaching hints.</p><p><em>Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R</em> is an excellent book for courses on mathematical statistics at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. It also serves as a valuable reference for applied statisticians working in the areas of business, economics, biostatistics, and public health who utilize resampling methods in their everyday work.</p></span></span></span>",

The book has been primarily designed as a useful companion for a Masters student during each semester of the course, but will also help applied statisticians in revisiting the underpinnings of the subject. With this dual goal in mind, the book begins with R basics and quickly covers visualization and exploratory analysis. Probability and statistical inference, inclusive of classical, nonparametric, and Bayesian schools, is developed with definitions, motivations, mathematical expression and R programs in a way which will help the reader to understand the mathematical development as well as R implementation. Linear regression models, experimental designs, multivariate analysis, and categorical data analysis are treated in a way which makes effective use of visualization techniques and the related statistical techniques underlying them through practical applications, and hence helps the reader to achieve a clear understanding of the associated statistical models.<br/><p><i>Key features</i>:</p> <ul><li>Integrates R basics with statistical concepts</li><li>Provides graphical presentations inclusive of mathematical expressions</li><li>Aids understanding of limit theorems of probability with and without the simulation approach</li><li>Presents detailed algorithmic development of statistical models from scratch</li><li>Includes practical applications with over 50 data sets</li></ul></span></span></span></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p><em>Mathematics and Statistics for Financial Risk Management</em> is a practical guide to modern financial risk management for both practitioners and academics.</p><p>The recent financial crisis and its impact on the broader economy underscore the importance of financial risk management in today's world. At the same time, financial products and investment strategies are becoming increasingly complex. Today, it is more important than ever that risk managers possess a sound understanding of mathematics and statistics.</p><p>In a concise and easy-to-read style, each chapter of this book introduces a different topic in mathematics or statistics. As different techniques are introduced, sample problems and application sections demonstrate how these techniques can be applied to actual risk management problems. Exercises at the end of each chapter and the accompanying solutions at the end of the book allow readers to practice the techniques they are learning and monitor their progress. A companion website includes interactive Excel spreadsheet examples and templates.</p><p>This comprehensive resource covers basic statistical concepts from volatility and Bayes' Law to regression analysis and hypothesis testing. Widely used risk models, including Value-at-Risk, factor analysis, Monte Carlo simulations, and stress testing are also explored. A chapter on time series analysis introduces interest rate modeling, GARCH, and jump-diffusion models. Bond pricing, portfolio credit risk, optimal hedging, and many other financial risk topics are covered as well.</p><p>If you're looking for a book that will help you understand the mathematics and statistics of financial risk management, look no further.</p></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan builds your knowledge of and confidence in making inferences from data. Reflecting the need for scripting in today's model-based statistics, the book pushes you to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that you understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in your own modeling work.</p><p></p><p>The text presents causal inference and generalized linear multilevel models from a simple Bayesian perspective that builds on information theory and maximum entropy. The core material ranges from the basics of regression to advanced multilevel models. It also presents measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and phylogenetic confounding.</p><p></p><p>The second edition emphasizes the directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach to causal inference, integrating DAGs into many examples. The new edition also contains new material on the design of prior distributions, splines, ordered categorical predictors, social relations models, cross-validation, importance sampling, instrumental variables, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. It ends with an entirely new chapter that goes beyond generalized linear modeling, showing how domain-specific scientific models can be built into statistical analyses.</p><p></p><b>\n</b><p>Features</p><ul><b></b><p>\n</p><li>Integrates working code into the main text</li><p></p><p>\n</p><li>Illustrates concepts through worked data analysis examples</li><p></p><p>\n</p><li>Emphasizes understanding assumptions and how assumptions are reflected in code</li><p></p><p>\n</p><li>Offers more detailed explanations of the mathematics in optional sections</li><p></p><p>\n</p><li>Presents examples of using the dagitty R package to analyze causal graphs</li><p></p><p>\n</p><li>Provides the rethinking R package on the author's website and on GitHub</li></ul></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><i>Advanced Statistics with Applications in R </i>fills the gap between several excellent theoretical statistics textbooks and many applied statistics books where teaching reduces to using existing packages. This book looks at <i>what is under the hood</i>. Many statistics issues including the recent crisis with <i>p</i>-value are caused by misunderstanding of statistical concepts due to poor theoretical background of practitioners and applied statisticians. This book is the product of a forty-year experience in teaching of probability and statistics and their applications for solving real-life problems.</p><p>There are more than 442 examples in the book: basically every probability or statistics concept is illustrated with an example accompanied with an <b>R</b> code. Many examples, such as <i>Who said π? What team is better? The fall of the Roman empire, James Bond chase problem, Black Friday shopping, Free fall equation: Aristotle or Galilei</i>, and many others are intriguing. These examples cover biostatistics, finance, physics and engineering, text and image analysis, epidemiology, spatial statistics, sociology, etc.</p><p><i>Advanced Statistics with Applications in R</i> teaches students to use theory for solving real-life problems through computations: there are about 500 <b>R</b> codes and 100 datasets. These data can be freely downloaded from the author's website <b>dartmouth.edu/~eugened</b>.</p><p>This book is suitable as a text for senior undergraduate students with major in statistics or data science or graduate students. Many researchers who apply statistics on the regular basis find explanation of many fundamental concepts from the theoretical perspective illustrated by concrete real-world applications. </p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><i>Probability, Random Variables, Statistics, and Random Processes: Fundamentals &amp; Applications </i>is a comprehensive undergraduate-level textbook. With its excellent topical coverage, the focus of this book is on the basic principles and practical applications of the fundamental concepts that are extensively used in various Engineering disciplines as well as in a variety of programs in Life and Social Sciences. The text provides students with the requisite building blocks of knowledge they require to understand and progress in their areas of interest. With a simple, clear-cut style of writing, the intuitive explanations, insightful examples, and practical applications are the hallmarks of this book.</p><p>The text consists of twelve chapters divided into four parts. Part-I, Probability (Chapters 1 – 3), lays a solid groundwork for probability theory, and introduces applications in counting, gambling, reliability, and security. Part-II, Random Variables (Chapters 4 – 7), discusses in detail multiple random variables, along with a multitude of frequently-encountered probability distributions. Part-III, Statistics (Chapters 8 – 10), highlights estimation and hypothesis testing. Part-IV, Random Processes (Chapters 11 – 12), delves into the characterization and processing of random processes. Other notable features include:</p><ul><li>Most of the text assumes no knowledge of subject matter past first year calculus and linear algebra</li><li>With its independent chapter structure and rich choice of topics, a variety of syllabi for different courses at the junior, senior, and graduate levels can be supported</li><li>A supplemental website includes solutions to about 250 practice problems, lecture slides, and figures and tables from the text </li></ul><p>Given its engaging tone, grounded approach, methodically-paced flow, thorough coverage, and flexible structure, <i>Probability, Random Variables, Statistics, and Random Processes: Fundamentals &amp; Applications </i>clearly serves as a must textbook for courses not only in Electrical Engineering, but also in Computer Engineering, Software Engineering, and Computer Science.</p></span>",

The book provides various parametric tests and the related assumptions and shows the procedures for testing these assumptions using SPSS software. To motivate readers to use assumptions, it includes many situations where violation of assumptions affects the findings. Assumptions required for different non-parametric tests such as Chi-square, Mann-Whitney, Kruskal Wallis, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test are also discussed. Finally, it looks at assumptions in non-parametric correlations, such as bi-serial correlation, tetrachoric correlation, and phi coefficient.</p><ul><li>An excellent reference for graduate students and research scholars of any discipline in testing assumptions of statistical tests before using them in their research study</li><li>Shows readers the adverse effect of violating the assumptions on findings by means of various illustrations</li><li>Describes different assumptions associated with different statistical tests commonly used by research scholars</li><li>Contains examples using SPSS, which helps facilitate readers to understand the procedure involved in testing assumptions</li><li>Looks at commonly used assumptions in statistical tests, such as z, t and F tests, ANOVA, correlation, and regression analysis</li></ul><p><i>Testing Statistical Assumptions in Research</i> is a valuable resource for graduate students of any discipline who write thesis or dissertation for empirical studies in their course works, as well as for data analysts.</p></span>",

    "title": "Understanding The New Statistics",
    "description": "<span><p>This is the first book to introduce the <em>new statistics - </em>effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis - in an accessible way. It is chock full of practical examples and tips on how to analyze and report research results using these techniques. The book is invaluable to readers interested in meeting the new APA <em>Publication Manual</em> guidelines by adopting the new statistics - which are more informative than null hypothesis significance testing, and becoming widely used in many disciplines.</p><p>Accompanying the book is the Exploratory Software for Confidence Intervals (ESCI) package, free software that runs under Excel and is accessible at www.thenewstatistics.com. The book’s exercises use ESCI's simulations, which are highly visual and interactive, to engage users and encourage exploration. Working with the simulations strengthens understanding of key statistical ideas. There are also many examples, and detailed guidance to show readers how to analyze their own data using the new statistics, and practical strategies for interpreting the results. A particular strength of the book is its explanation of meta-analysis, using simple diagrams and examples. Understanding meta-analysis is increasingly important, even at undergraduate levels, because medicine, psychology and many other disciplines now use meta-analysis to assemble the evidence needed for evidence-based practice.</p><p>The book’s pedagogical program, built on cognitive science principles, reinforces learning:</p><ul><p>\n</p><li>Boxes provide \"evidence-based\" advice on the most effective statistical techniques. </li><li>Numerous examples reinforce learning, and show that many disciplines are using the new statistics.</li><li>Graphs are tied in with ESCI to make important concepts vividly clear and memorable.</li><li>Opening overviews and end of chapter take-home messages summarize key points.</li><li>Exercises encourage exploration, deep understanding, and practical applications.</li></ul><p>This highly accessible book is intended as the core text for any course that emphasizes the new statistics, or as a supplementary text for graduate and/or advanced undergraduate courses in statistics and research methods in departments of psychology, education, human development , nursing, and natural, social, and life sciences. Researchers and practitioners interested in understanding the new statistics, and future published research, will also appreciate this book. A basic familiarity with introductory statistics is assumed.</p></span>",

This book aims to provide the practitioners of tomorrow with a memorable, easy to read, engaging guide to statistics and experimental design.</p><p>This book uses examples, drawn from a variety of established texts, and embeds them in a business or scientific context, seasoned with a dash of humor, to emphasize the issues and ideas that led to the experiment and the <em>what-do-we-do-next?</em> steps after the experiment. Graphical data displays are emphasized as means of discovery and communication and formulas are minimized, with a focus on interpreting the results that software produce. The role of subject-matter knowledge, and passion, is also illustrated. The examples do not require specialized knowledge, and the lessons they contain are transferrable to other contexts.</p><p><em>Fundamentals of Statistical Experimental Design and Analysis</em> introduces the basic elements of an experimental design, and the basic concepts underlying statistical analyses. Subsequent chapters address the following families of experimental designs:</p><li><p>Completely Randomized designs, with single or multiple treatment factors, quantitative or qualitative</p></li><li><p>Randomized Block designs</p></li><li><p>Latin Square designs</p></li><li><p>Split-Unit designs</p></li><li><p>Repeated Measures designs</p></li><li><p>Robust designs</p></li><li><p>Optimal designs</p></li><p>Written in an accessible, student-friendly style, this book is suitable for a general audience and particularly for those professionals seeking to improve and apply their understanding of experimental design.</p></span></span></span></span>",

This insider's guide from internationally recognized applied statisticians helps readers decide whether a career in statistics is right for them, provides hands-on guidance on how to prepare for such a career, and shows how to succeed on the job.</p><p>The book provides non-technical guidance for a successful career. The authors' extensive industrial experience is supplemented by insights from contributing authors from government and academia, Carol Joyce Blumberg, Leonard M. Gaines, Lynne B. Hare, William Q. Meeker, and Josef Schmee. Following an introductory chapter that provides an overview of the field, the authors discuss the various dimensions of a career in applied statistics in three succinct parts:</p><ul><li><p><b>The Work of a Statistician</b> describes the day-to-day activities of applied statisticians in business and industry, official government, and various other application areas, highlighting the work environment and major on-the-job challenges</p></li><li><p><b>Preparing for a Successful Career in Statistics</b> describes the personal traits that characterize successful statisticians, the education that they need to acquire, and approaches for securing the right job</p></li><li><p><b>Building a Successful Career as a Statistician</b> offers practical guidance for addressing key challenges that statisticians face on the job, such as project initiation and execution, effective communication, publicizing successes, ethical considerations, and gathering good data; alternative career paths are also described</p></li></ul><p>The book concludes with an in-depth examination of careers for statisticians in academia as well as tips to help them stay on top of their field throughout their careers. Each chapter includes thought-provoking discussion questions and a Major Takeaways section that outlines key concepts. Real-world examples illustrate key points, and an FTP site provides additional information on selected topics.</p><p><em>A Career in Statistics</em> is an invaluable guide for individuals who are considering or have decided on a career in statistics as well as for statisticians already on the job who want to accelerate their path to success. It also serves as a suitable book for courses on statistical consulting, statistical practice, and statistics in the workplace at the undergraduate and graduate levels.</p></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>The long-awaited revision of <i>Fundamentals of Applied Probability and Random Processes</i> expands on the central components that made the first edition a classic. The title is based on the premise that engineers use probability as a modeling tool, and that probability can be applied to the solution of engineering problems. Engineers and students studying probability and random processes also need to analyze data, and thus need some knowledge of statistics. This book is designed to provide students with a thorough grounding in probability and stochastic processes, demonstrate their applicability to real-world problems, and introduce the basics of statistics. The book's clear writing style and homework problems make it ideal for the classroom or for self-study. </p><ul><li>Demonstrates concepts with more than 100 illustrations, including 2 dozen new drawings</li><li>Expands readers’ understanding of disruptive statistics in a new chapter (chapter 8) </li><li>Provides new chapter on Introduction to Random Processes with 14 new illustrations and tables explaining key concepts.</li><li>Includes two chapters devoted to the two branches of statistics, namely descriptive statistics (chapter 8) and inferential (or inductive) statistics (chapter 9).</li></ul></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><span><span><span><p> <b>Features an integrated approach of statistical scenarios and simulations to aid readers in developing key intuitions needed to understand the wide ranging concepts and methods of statistics and inference</b></p><p><i>Illuminating Statistical Analysis Using Scenarios and Simulations </i>presents the basic concepts of statistics and statistical inference using the dual mechanisms of scenarios and simulations. This approach helps readers develop key intuitions and deep understandings of statistical analysis. Scenario-specific sampling simulations depict the results that would be obtained by a very large number of individuals investigating the same scenario, each with their own evidence, while graphical depictions of the simulation results present clear and direct pathways to intuitive methods for statistical inference. These intuitive methods can then be easily linked to traditional formulaic methods, and the author does not simply explain the linkages, but rather provides demonstrations throughout for a broad range of statistical phenomena. In addition, induction and deduction are repeatedly interwoven, which fosters a natural \"need to know basis\" for ordering the topic coverage.</p><p>Examining computer simulation results is central to the discussion and provides an illustrative way to (re)discover the properties of sample statistics, the role of chance, and to (re)invent corresponding principles of statistical inference. In addition, the simulation results foreshadow the various mathematical formulas that underlie statistical analysis.</p><p>In addition, this book:</p><p>• Features both an intuitive and analytical perspective and includes a broad introduction to the use of Monte Carlo simulation and formulaic methods for statistical analysis</p><p>• Presents straight-forward coverage of the essentials of basic statistics and ensures proper understanding of key concepts such as sampling distributions, the effects of sample size and variance on uncertainty, analysis of proportion, mean and rank differences, covariance, correlation, and regression</p><p>• Introduces advanced topics such as Bayesian statistics, data mining, model cross-validation, robust regression, and resampling</p><p>• Contains numerous example problems in each chapter with detailed solutions as well as an appendix that serves as a manual for constructing simulations quickly and easily using Microsoft® Office Excel®</p><p><i>Illuminating Statistical Analysis Using Scenarios and Simulations </i>is an ideal textbook for courses, seminars, and workshops in statistics and statistical inference and is appropriate for self-study as well. The book also serves as a thought-provoking treatise for researchers, scientists, managers, technicians, and others with a keen interest in statistical analysis.</p><p><b>Jeffrey E.

Nahin, Professor Emeritus of Electrical Engineering, University of New Hampshire</em></p><p>Classic Problems of Probability presents a lively account of the most intriguing aspects of statistics. The book features a large collection of more than thirty classic probability problems which have been carefully selected for their interesting history, the way they have shaped the field, and their counterintuitive nature.</p><p>From Cardano's 1564 Games of Chance to Jacob Bernoulli's 1713 Golden Theorem to Parrondo's 1996 Perplexing Paradox, the book clearly outlines the puzzles and problems of probability, interweaving the discussion with rich historical detail and the story of how the mathematicians involved arrived at their solutions. Each problem is given an in-depth treatment, including detailed and rigorous mathematical proofs as needed. Some of the fascinating topics discussed by the author include:</p><ul><li><p>Buffon's Needle problem and its ingenious treatment by Joseph Barbier, culminating into a discussion of invariance</p></li><li><p>Various paradoxes raised by Joseph Bertrand</p></li><li><p>Classic problems in decision theory, including Pascal's Wager, Kraitchik's Neckties, and Newcomb's problem</p></li><li><p>The Bayesian paradigm and various philosophies of probability</p></li><li><p>Coverage of both elementary and more complex problems, including the Chevalier de Méré problems, Fisher and the lady testing tea, the birthday problem and its various extensions, and the Borel-Kolmogorov paradox</p></li></ul><p>Classic Problems of Probability is an eye-opening, one-of-a-kind reference for researchers and professionals interested in the history of probability and the varied problem-solving strategies employed throughout the ages. The book also serves as an insightful supplement for courses on mathematical probability and introductory probability and statistics at the undergraduate level.</p></span></span></span>",

It takes a wholly practical approach to the subject. Statistics are applied throughout the life of a process control scheme – from assessing its economic benefit, designing inferential properties, identifying dynamic models, monitoring performance and diagnosing faults. This book addresses all of these areas and more.</p><p>The book begins with an overview of various statistical applications in the field of process control, followed by discussions of data characteristics, probability functions, data presentation, sample size, significance testing and commonly used mathematical functions. It then shows how to select and fit a distribution to data, before moving on to the application of regression analysis and data reconciliation. The book is extensively illustrated throughout with line drawings, tables and equations, and features numerous worked examples. In addition, two appendices include the data used in the examples and an exhaustive catalogue of statistical distributions. The data and a simple-to-use software tool are available for download. The reader can thus reproduce all of the examples and then extend the same statistical techniques to real problems.</p><ul><li>Takes a back-to-basics approach with a focus on techniques that have immediate, practical, problem-solving applications for practicing engineers, as well as engineering students</li><li>Shows how to avoid the many common errors made by the industry in applying statistics to process control</li><li>Describes not only the well-known statistical distributions but also demonstrates the advantages of applying the large number that are less well-known</li><li>Inspires engineers to identify new applications of statistical techniques to the design and support of control schemes</li><li>Provides a deeper understanding of services and products which control engineers are often tasked with assessing</li></ul><p>This book is a valuable professional resource for engineers working in the global process industry and engineering companies, as well as students of engineering.

The authors cover various statistical and mathematical techniques, including linear and nonlinear time series analysis, stochastic calculus models, stochastic differential equations, Itō’s formula, the Black–Scholes model, the generalized method-of-moments, and the Kalman filter. They explain how these tools are used to price financial derivatives, identify interest rate models, value bonds, estimate parameters, and much more. </p><p/><p>This textbook will help students understand and manage empirical research in financial engineering. It includes examples of how the statistical tools can be used to improve value-at-risk calculations and other issues.

    "description": "<span><p>Examine and solve the common misconceptions and fallacies that non-statisticians bring to their interpretation of statistical results. Explore the many pitfalls that non-statisticians—and also statisticians who present statistical reports to non-statisticians—must avoid if statistical results are to be correctly used for evidence-based business decision making.</p><p>Victoria Cox, senior statistician at the United Kingdom's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl), distills the lessons of her long experience presenting the actionable results of complex statistical studies to users of widely varying statistical sophistication across many disciplines: from scientists, engineers, analysts, and information technologists to executives, military personnel, project managers, and officials across UK government departments, industry, academia, and international partners.</p><p>The author shows how faulty statistical reasoning often undermines the utility of statistical results even among those with advanced technical training. <i>Translating Statistics</i> teaches statistically naive readers enough about statistical questions, methods, models, assumptions, and statements that they will be able to extract the practical message from statistical reports and better constrain what conclusions cannot be made from the results. To non-statisticians with some statistical training, this book offers brush-ups, reminders, and tips for the proper use of statistics and solutions to common errors. To fellow statisticians, the author demonstrates how to present statistical output to non-statisticians to ensure that the statistical results are correctly understood and properly applied to real-world tasks and decisions. The book avoids algebra and proofs, but it does supply code written in R for those readers who are motivated to work out examples.</p><p>Pointing along the way to instructive examples of statistics gone awry, <i>Translating Statistics</i> walks readers through the typical course of a statistical study, progressing from the experimental design stage through the data collection process, exploratory data analysis, descriptive statistics, uncertainty, hypothesis testing, statistical modelling and multivariate methods, to graphs suitable for final presentation. The steady focus throughout the book is on how to turn the mathematical artefacts and specialist jargon that are second nature to statisticians into plain English for corporate customers and stakeholders. The final chapter neatly summarizes the book's lessons and insights for accurately communicating statistical reports to the non-statisticians who commission and act on them.</p><p><b>What You'll Learn</b></p><ul><li><p>Recognize and avoid common errors and misconceptions that cause statistical studies to be misinterpreted and misused by non-statisticians in organizational settings</p></li><li><p>Gain a practical understanding of the methods, processes, capabilities, and caveats of statistical studies to improve the application of statistical data to business decisions</p></li><li><p>See how to code statistical solutions in R</p></li></ul><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>Non-statisticians—including both those with and without an introductory statistics course under their belts—who consume statistical reports in organizational settings, and statisticians who seek guidance for reporting statistical studies to non-statisticians in ways that will be accurately understood and will inform sound business and technical decisions</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Statistics is the branch of mathematics that deals with real life problems. As such, it is an essential tool for economists. Unfortunately, the way the concept is introduced to students is not compatible with the way economists think and learn. The problem is worsened by the use of mathematical jargon and complex derivations. However, as this book demonstrates, neither is necessary. The book is written in simple English with minimal use of symbols, mostly for the sake of brevity and to make reading literature more meaningful. The second edition also incorporates Stata software for use by more technically oriented readers who have access to sophisticated software. The objective of this book is to address the fundamentals of statistical analysis in a simple and easy-to-comprehend way. Instead of covering numerous topics, the book covers interrelated subjects that are necessary for the comprehension of the presented topics. The second edition has augmented the explanations in the first to clarify the subjects even more. The examples are based on economic theory utilizing actual data. The hope is that the use of theory will prove useful in relating the subject to actual empirical applications and help with research.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><b>Game-theoretic probability and finance come of age</b></p><p>Glenn Shafer and Vladimir Vovk’s <i>Probability and Finance</i>, published in 2001, showed that perfect-information games can be used to define mathematical probability. Based on fifteen years of further research, <i>Game-Theoretic Foundations for Probability and Finance</i> presents a mature view of the foundational role game theory can play. Its account of probability theory opens the way to new methods of prediction and testing and makes many statistical methods more transparent and widely usable. Its contributions to finance theory include purely game-theoretic accounts of Ito’s stochastic calculus, the capital asset pricing model, the equity premium, and portfolio theory.</p><p><i>Game-Theoretic Foundations for Probability and Finance</i> is a book of research. It is also a teaching resource. Each chapter is supplemented with carefully designed exercises and notes relating the new theory to its historical context.</p><p><b>Praise from early readers</b></p><p>“Ever since Kolmogorov's <i>Grundbegriffe</i>, the standard mathematical treatment of probability theory has been measure-theoretic. In this ground-breaking work, Shafer and Vovk give a game-theoretic foundation instead. While being just as rigorous, the game-theoretic approach allows for vast and useful generalizations of classical measure-theoretic results, while also giving rise to new, radical ideas for prediction, statistics and mathematical finance without stochastic assumptions. The authors set out their theory in great detail, resulting in what is definitely one of the most important books on the foundations of probability to have appeared in the last few decades.” – Peter Grünwald, CWI and University of Leiden</p><p>“Shafer and Vovk have thoroughly re-written their 2001 book on the game-theoretic foundations for probability and for finance. They have included an account of the tremendous growth that has occurred since, in the game-theoretic and pathwise approaches to stochastic analysis and in their applications to continuous-time finance. This new book will undoubtedly spur a better understanding of the foundations of these very important fields, and we should all be grateful to its authors.” – Ioannis Karatzas, Columbia University</p></span>",

Researchers learn how to specify regression models that directly address their research questions. An overview of the fundamental ideas of multiple regression and a review of bivariate correlation and regression and other elementary statistical concepts provide a strong foundation for understanding the rest of the text. The third edition features an increased emphasis on graphics and the use of confidence intervals and effect size measures, and an accompanying website with data for most of the numerical examples along with the computer code for SPSS, SAS, and SYSTAT, at www.psypress.com/9780805822236 . </p><p><em>Applied Multiple Regression</em> serves as both a textbook for graduate students and as a reference tool for researchers in psychology, education, health sciences, communications, business, sociology, political science, anthropology, and economics. An introductory knowledge of statistics is required. Self-standing chapters minimize the need for researchers to refer to previous chapters.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>Many areas of mining engineering gather and use statistical information, provided by observing the actual operation of equipment, their systems, the development of mining works, surface subsidence that accompanies underground mining, displacement of rocks surrounding surface pits and underground drives and longwalls, amongst others. In addition, the actual modern machines used in surface mining are equipped with diagnostic systems that automatically trace all important machine parameters and send this information to the main producer’s computer. Such data not only provide information on the technical properties of the machine but they also have a statistical character. Furthermore, all information gathered during stand and lab investigations where parts, assemblies and whole devices are tested in order to prove their usefulness, have a stochastic character. All of these materials need to be developed statistically and, more importantly, based on these results mining engineers must make decisions whether to undertake actions, connected with the further operation of the machines, the further development of the works, etc. For these reasons, knowledge of modern statistics is necessary for mining engineers; not only as to how statistical analysis of data should be conducted and statistical synthesis should be done, but also as to understanding the results obtained and how to use them to make appropriate decisions in relation to the mining operation.</p><p>This book on statistical analysis and synthesis starts with a short repetition of probability theory and also includes a special section on statistical prediction. The text is illustrated with many examples taken from mining practice; moreover the tables required to conduct statistical inference are included.</p></span></span>",

    "title": "Statistics for Economics",
    "description": "<span><p>Statistics is the branch of mathematics that deals with real-life problems. As such, it is an essential tool for economists. Unfortunately, the way you and many other economists learn the concept of statistics is not compatible with the way economists think and learn. The problem is worsened by the use of mathematical jargon and complex derivations. Here’s a book that proves none of this is necessary. All the examples and exercises in this book are constructed within the field of economics, thus eliminating the difficulty of learning statistics with examples from fields that have no relation to business, politics, or policy. Statistics is, in fact, not more difficult than economics. Anyone who can comprehend economics can understand and use statistics successfully within this field, including you! This book utilizes Microsoft Excel to obtain statistical results, as well as to perform additional necessary computations. Microsoft Excel is not the software of choice for performing sophisticated statistical analysis. However, it is widely available, and almost everyone has some degree of familiarity with it. Using Excel will eliminate the need for students and readers to buy and learn new software, the need that itself would prove to be another impediment to learning and using statistics.</p></span>",

The author posits that nobody is a completely intuitive teacher and that everybody has to make a series of choices as they put courses together. The decisions they make are important and far-reaching, and deserve to be considered carefully.</p><p>Starting with the three core factors which must be taken into account when creating courses, <em>Creating Courses for Adults</em> walks readers through a manageable process for addressing the key decisions which must be made in order to design effective learning.</p><li><p><em>Instructor</em> factors are what the teacher brings to the teaching and learning process, such as experience and preferences.</p></li><li><p><em>Learner</em> factors are the influences that students bring with them, including their past experiences and expectations for the class.</p></li><li><p><em>Context</em> factors include the educational setting, whether in-person or online, as well as the subject matter.</p></li><p>Readers of <em>Creating Courses for Adults</em> will learn a systematic approach to lesson and course design based on research into the ways adults learn and the best ways to reach them, along with pointers and tips for teaching adults in any setting.</p></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>From newborns switched in the nursery to medication mix-ups and hospital-acquired infections, we are all familiar with the horror stories about hospital safety, and unfortunately, the statistics say we aren’t exaggerating. The safety issue in U.S. hospitals has become so profound and embedded, that we cannot hope to fix it without a paradigm shift in our approach. After defining and demonstrating the true depth of this dangerous concern, <strong><em>Safer Hospital Care: Strategies for Continuous Innovation</em></strong> elaborates on the steps required to make that paradigm shift a reality.<br/><br/>A respected and sought out expert on hospital safety, author Dev Raheja draws on his 25 years of experience as a risk management and quality assurance consultant to provide hospital stakeholders with a systematic way to learn the science of safe care. Supported by case studies as well as input from such paradigm pioneers as Johns Hopkins and Seattle Children’s, he explains how to:</p><ul><p>\n</p><li>Adapt evidence-based safety theories and tools taken from the aerospace, nuclear, and chemical industries</li><li>Identify the combination of root causes that result in an adverse event</li><li>Apply analytical tools that can effectively measure hospital efficiency</li><li>Establish evidence between Lean strategies and patient satisfaction</li><li>Make use of various types of innovation including accidental, incremental, strategic, and radical, and establish a culture conducive to innovation</li><p/></ul><p>This practical guide shows how to find solutions that are simple and comprehensive, and can produce a high ROI. To reform hospitals, we must recognize that they are highly dynamic systems that must be fixed systemically. Instead of thinking in terms of continuous improvement, we need to think in terms of continuous innovation. Safe hospital care is not just about doing things right; it is also about breaking old habits, finding new tools and <em>doing the right things.</em></p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><span><p><b>Mixed modelling is very useful, and easier than you think!</b></p><p>Mixed modelling is now well established as a powerful approach to statistical data analysis. It is based on the recognition of random-effect terms in statistical models, leading to inferences and estimates that have much wider applicability and are more realistic than those otherwise obtained.</p><p><em>Introduction to Mixed Modelling</em> leads the reader into mixed modelling as a natural extension of two more familiar methods, regression analysis and analysis of variance. It provides practical guidance combined with a clear explanation of the underlying concepts.</p><p>Like the first edition, this new edition shows diverse applications of mixed models, provides guidance on the identification of random-effect terms, and explains how to obtain and interpret best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs). It also introduces several important new topics, including the following:</p><li><p>Use of the software SAS, in addition to GenStat and R.</p></li><li><p>Meta-analysis and the multiple testing problem.</p></li><li><p>The Bayesian interpretation of mixed models.</p></li><p>Including numerous practical exercises with solutions, this book provides an ideal introduction to mixed modelling for final year undergraduate students, postgraduate students and professional researchers. It will appeal to readers from a wide range of scientific disciplines including statistics, biology, bioinformatics, medicine, agriculture, engineering, economics, archaeology and geography.</p><p><b>Praise for the first edition:</b></p><p>\"One of the main strengths of the text is the bridge it provides between traditional analysis of variance and regression models and the more recently developed class of mixed models...Each chapter is well-motivated by at least one carefully chosen example...demonstrating the broad applicability of mixed models in many different disciplines...most readers will likely learn something new, and those previously unfamiliar with mixed models will obtain a solid foundation on this topic.\"—<b>Kerrie Nelson University of South Carolina, in American Statistician, 2007</b></p></span></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Nonparametric statistics provide a scientific methodology for cases where customary statistics are not applicable. Nonparametric statistics are used when the requirements for parametric analysis fail, such as when data are not normally distributed or the sample size is too small. The method provides an alternative for such cases and is often nearly as powerful as parametric statistics. Another advantage of nonparametric statistics is that it offers analytical methods that are not available otherwise. Nonparametric methods are intuitive and simple to comprehend, which helps researchers in the social sciences understand the methods in spite of lacking mathematical rigor needed in analytical methods customarily used in science. This book is a methodology book and bypasses theoretical proofs while providing comprehensive explanations of the logic behind the methods and ample examples, which are all solved using direct computations as well as by using Stata. It is arranged into two integrated volumes. Although each volume, and for that matter each chapter, can be used separately, it is advisable to read as much of both volumes as possible; because familiarity with what is applicable for different problems will enhance capabilities.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Nonparametric statistics provide a scientific methodology for cases where customary statistics are not applicable. Nonparametric statistics are used when the requirements for parametric analysis fail, such as when data are not normally distributed or the sample size is too small. The method provides an alternative for such cases and is often nearly as powerful as parametric statistics. Another advantage of nonparametric statistics is that it offers analytical methods that are not available otherwise. Nonparametric methods are intuitive and simple to comprehend, which helps researchers in the social sciences understand the methods in spite of lacking mathematical rigor needed in analytical methods customarily used in science. This book is a methodology book and bypasses theoretical proofs while providing comprehensive explanations of the logic behind the methods and ample examples, which are all solved using direct computations as well as by using Stata. It is arranged into two integrated volumes. Although each volume, and for that matter each chapter, can be used separately, it is advisable to read as much of both volumes as possible; because familiarity with what is applicable for different problems will enhance capabilities.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><span><p><b>An original account of willful ignorance and how this principle relates to modern probability and statistical methods</b></p><p>Through a series of colorful stories about great thinkers and the problems they chose to solve, the author traces the historical evolution of probability and explains how statistical methods have helped to propel scientific research. However, the past success of statistics has depended on vast, deliberate simplifications amounting to willful ignorance, and this very success now threatens future advances in medicine, the social sciences, and other fields. Limitations of existing methods result in frequent reversals of scientific findings and recommendations, to the consternation of both scientists and the lay public.</p><p><em>Willful Ignorance: The Mismeasure of Uncertainty</em> exposes the fallacy of regarding probability as the full measure of our uncertainty. The book explains how statistical methodology, though enormously productive and influential over the past century, is approaching a crisis. The deep and troubling divide between qualitative and quantitative modes of research, and between research and practice, are reflections of this underlying problem. The author outlines a path toward the re-engineering of data analysis to help close these gaps and accelerate scientific discovery.</p><p><em>Willful Ignorance: The Mismeasure of Uncertainty</em> presents essential information and novel ideas that should be of interest to anyone concerned about the future of scientific research. The book is especially pertinent for professionals in statistics and related fields, including practicing and research clinicians, biomedical and social science researchers, business leaders, and policy-makers.</p></span></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Bayesian Inference for Partially Identified Models: Exploring the Limits of Limited Data shows how the Bayesian approach to inference is applicable to partially identified models (PIMs) and examines the performance of Bayesian procedures in partially identified contexts. Drawing on his many years of research in this area, the author presents a thorough overview of the statistical theory, properties, and applications of PIMs.</p><p>The book first describes how reparameterization can assist in computing posterior quantities and providing insight into the properties of Bayesian estimators. It next compares partial identification and model misspecification, discussing which is the lesser of the two evils. The author then works through PIM examples in depth, examining the ramifications of partial identification in terms of how inferences change and the extent to which they sharpen as more data accumulate. He also explains how to characterize the value of information obtained from data in a partially identified context and explores some recent applications of PIMs. In the final chapter, the author shares his thoughts on the past and present state of research on partial identification.</p><p>This book helps readers understand how to use Bayesian methods for analyzing PIMs. Readers will recognize under what circumstances a posterior distribution on a target parameter will be usefully narrow versus uselessly wide.</p></span>",

The headlines, and the statistics behind them, however, don’t tell the whole story. The truth is, many women today are breadwinners; and these breadwinners are struggling. They are caught in a perfect storm of male-dominated culture at work, traditional social norms at home, and outdated schedules in the schools. Mogul, Mom, &amp;amp; Maid takes an honest look at how women are balancing home life and career. The pressures of child rearing, coupled with an unfulfilling corporate culture, are too great to be ignored. Author Liz O’Donnell goes beyond statistics and tells the stories of women all across America who are juggling careers, motherhood, marriage, and households. Mogul, Mom, &amp;amp;  Maid looks at the choices women are making, the options they have, and the impact these decisions have on themselves, their families, and the businesses that employ them.</p></span>",

Why statistics? First, they allow you to make better decisions because data can be analyzed using proven mathematical principles and logic. Second, data are generated each moment across all business functions, and statistics allows the trainer quickly relate to business processes. Third, repetition is important for learner comprehension, and incorporating statistics and measures into training delivery helps learners acquire knowledge better and faster. And finally, the judicious use of statistics in presentations is a powerful way to support your case at higher organizational levels</p></span></span></span>",

Examples where this fuzziness is obvious are quality of life data, environmental, biological, medical, sociological and economics data. Also the results of measurements can be best described by using fuzzy numbers and fuzzy vectors respectively.</p><p>Statistical analysis methods have to be adapted for the analysis of fuzzy data. In this book, the foundations of the description of fuzzy data are explained, including methods on how to obtain the characterizing function of fuzzy measurement results. Furthermore, statistical methods are then generalized to the analysis of fuzzy data and fuzzy a-priori information.</p><p>Key Features:</p><li><p>Provides basic methods for the mathematical description of fuzzy data, as well as statistical methods that can be used to analyze fuzzy data.</p></li><li><p>Describes methods of increasing importance with applications in areas such as environmental statistics and social science.</p></li><li><p>Complements the theory with exercises and solutions and is illustrated throughout with diagrams and examples.</p></li><li><p>Explores areas such quantitative description of data uncertainty and mathematical description of fuzzy data.</p></li><p>This work is aimed at statisticians working with fuzzy logic, engineering statisticians, finance researchers, and environmental statisticians.

    "description": "<span><strong>27+ Hours of Video Instruction</strong><br/><br/>\n\nAn outstanding data scientist or machine learning engineer must master more than the basics of using ML algorithms with the most popular libraries, such as scikit-learn and Keras. To train innovative models or deploy them to run performantly in production, an in-depth appreciation of machine learning theory is essential, which includes a working understanding of the foundational subjects of linear algebra, calculus, probability, statistics, data structures, and algorithms.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nWhen the foundations of machine learning are firm, it becomes easier to make the jump from general ML principles to specialized ML domains, such as deep learning, natural language processing, machine vision, and reinforcement learning. The more specialized the application, the more likely its implementation details are available only in academic papers or graduate-level textbooks, either of which assume an understanding of the foundational subjects.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>This master class includes the following courses:</strong>\n<ul><li><em>Linear Algebra for Machine Learning</em></li><li><em>Calculus for Machine Learning LiveLessons</em></li><li><em>Probability and Statistics for Machine Learning</em></li><li><em>Data Structures, Algorithms, and Machine Learning Optimization</em></li></ul>\n<em>Linear Algebra for Machine Learning LiveLessons</em> provides you with an understanding of the theory and practice of linear algebra, with a focus on machine learning applications.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Calculus for Machine Learning LiveLessons </em>introduces the mathematical field of calculus‚Äîthe study of rates of change‚Äîfrom the ground up. It is essential because computing derivatives via differentiation is the basis of optimizing most machine learning algorithms, including those used in deep learning, such as backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Probability and Statistics for Machine Learning (Machine Learning Foundations) LiveLessons </em>provides you with a functional, hands-on understanding of probability theory and statistical modeling, with a focus on machine learning applications.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Data Structures, Algorithms, and Machine Learning Optimization LiveLessons</em> provides you with a functional, hands-on understanding of the essential computer science for machine learning applications.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>About the Instructor</strong>\n\nJon Krohn is Chief Data Scientist at the machine learning company Nebula. He authored the book Deep Learning Illustrated, an instant #1 bestseller that was translated into seven languages. He is also the host of SuperDataScience, the industry‚Äôs most listened-to podcast. Jon is renowned for his compelling lectures, which he offers at Columbia University, New York University, leading industry conferences, via O'Reilly, and via his award-winning YouTube channel. He holds a PhD from Oxford and has been publishing on machine learning in prominent academic journals since 2010; his papers have been cited more than a thousand times.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Course Requirements</strong>\n<ul><li><strong>Mathematics: </strong>Familiarity with secondary school-level mathematics will make the course easier to follow. If you are comfortable dealing with quantitative information‚Äîsuch as understanding charts and rearranging simple equations‚Äîthen you should be well-prepared to follow along with all of the mathematics.</li><li><strong>Programming:</strong> All code demos are in Python so experience with it or another object-oriented programming language would be helpful for following along with the hands-on examples.</li></ul>\n<strong>About Pearson Video Training</strong>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nPearson publishes expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed. These professional and personal technology videos feature world-leading author instructors published by your trusted technology brands: Addison-Wesley, Cisco Press, Pearson IT Certification, Sams, and Que.

    "description": "<span><div>Dive into performance tuning by learning how data is structured and accessed in SQL Server.  Learn from this video how to use execution plans, IO metrics, and query timing to identify problematic queries and trace latency directly to missing or incorrect indexes. Also learn about cardinality and how it affects execution plans and overall query performance. Understanding how indexes and statistics work provides a solid foundation for writing better queries and architecting more effective database objects. </div><div><br/></div><div>The knowledge from this video helps you to dive further into procedural TSQL and identify why a stored procedure or ad-hoc query can perform unexpectedly badly. This video examines such cases through a discussion of the causes of poor performance in TSQL procedures along with solutions such as parameter sniffing. In addition, the video demonstrates how local variables perform differently from parameters and how plan reuse can benefit performance. When plan reuse harms performance, the correct solutions will be presented, allowing you to permanently solve a performance challenge without the use of hacks or temporary fixes.</div><div><br/></div><div><b>What You Will Learn</b></div><div><div><ul><li><div>Create effective table indexes with confidence</div></li><li><div>Identify queries where poor indexing is the cause of latency</div></li><li><div>Display and use statistical metrics to troubleshoot performance challenges</div></li><li><div>Optimize and speed up queries that make poor use of indexes</div></li><li><div>Find and resolve parameter sniffing problems in procedural TSQL</div></li><li><div>Identify when ad-hoc TSQL or local variables can negatively affect performance</div></li><li><div>Understand when plan reuse can inadvertently harm performance</div></li></ul></div></div><div><b>Who This Video Is For</b><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Database administrators, developers, and architects who need to write fast and efficient database queries.

Given the importance of interdisciplinary work in sustainability, the book brings together principles of statistics and probability, multivariate analysis, and spatial analysis methods applicable across a variety of science and engineering disciplines.</p><p><em><strong>Learn How to Use a Variety of Data Analysis and Statistics Methods</strong></em></p><p>Based on the author’s many years of teaching graduate and undergraduate students, this textbook emphasizes hands-on learning. Organized into two parts, it allows greater flexibility using the material in various countries and types of curricula. The first part covers probability, random variables and inferential statistics, applications of regression, time series analysis, and analysis of spatial point patterns. The second part uses matrix algebra to address multidimensional problems. After a review of matrices, it delves into multiple regression, dependent random processes and autoregressive time series, spatial analysis using geostatistics and spatial regression, discriminant analysis, and a variety of multivariate analyses based on eigenvector methods.</p><p><em><strong>Build from Fundamental Concepts to Effective Problem Solving</strong></em></p><p>Each chapter starts with conceptual and theoretical material to give a firm foundation in how the methods work. Examples and exercises illustrate the applications and demonstrate how to go from concepts to problem solving. Hands-on computer sessions allow students to grasp the practical implications and learn by doing. Throughout, the computer examples and exercises use <em>seeg</em> and <em>RcmdrPlugin.seeg</em>, open-source R packages developed by the author, which help students acquire the skills to implement and conduct analysis and to analyze the results.</p><p>This self-contained book offers a unified presentation of data analysis methods for more effective problem solving. With clear, easy-to-follow explanations, the book helps students to develop a solid understanding of basic statistical analysis and prepares them for learning the more advanced and specialized methods they will need in their work.</p></span>",
