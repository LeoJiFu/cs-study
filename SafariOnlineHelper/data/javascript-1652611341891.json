    "title": "JavaScript: The Good Parts",
    "description": "<span><span><span><p>\nMost programming languages contain good and bad parts, but\nJavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been\ndeveloped and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This\nauthoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a\nsubset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and\nmaintainable than the language as a whole-a subset you can use to\ncreate truly extensible and efficient code.\nConsidered <em>the</em> JavaScript expert by many people in the\ndevelopment community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the\nabundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding\nobject-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose\ntyping, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation.\nUnfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright\nawful ideas, like a programming model based on global\nvariables.\nWhen Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web\nby default, making its popularity almost completely independent of\nits qualities as a programming language. In <em>JavaScript: The\nGood Parts</em>, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile\nof good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all\nthe genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including:\n</p><ul><li><p>Syntax</p></li><li><p>Objects</p></li><li><p>Functions</p></li><li><p>Inheritance</p></li><li><p>Arrays</p></li><li><p>Regular expressions</p></li><li><p>Methods</p></li><li><p>Style</p></li><li><p>Beautiful features</p></li></ul><p>The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript\nthat this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to\n<em>unlearn</em> all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find\nout more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply\nconsult any other JavaScript book.\n</p><p>With <em>JavaScript: The Good Parts</em>, you'll discover a\nbeautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that\nlets you create effective code, whether you're managing object\nlibraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast. If you develop\nsites or applications for the Web, this book is an absolute\nmust.</p></span></span></span>",

The purpose of\n\nthis lesson is to provide you with the basics of developing\n\napplications using the Node.js platform. The lesson first covers\n\nsetting up a development environment that enables you to build\n\nNode.js, MongoDB and AngularJS applications. Next, you learn how to\n\nbuild Node.js applications and modules. You also learn how Node.js\n\nimplements callbacks to provide a single threaded model for\n\napplications. Then you learn how to implement events in your\n\nNode.js applications. Finally, you learn how to use readable and\n\nwriteable streams to stream data to and from files.\n\n<br/><br/><b>Lesson 2: MongoDB Fundamentals</b><br/>Lesson 2 introduces you to the MongoDB database. The purpose\n\nof this lesson is to teach you how to use the MongoDB shell to\n\naccess and manage databases. You first learn how to access the\n\nMongoDB shell and execute commands. Then you learn how to use shell\n\ncommands to create databases, collections and documents. Next, you\n\nlearn how to view documents in a collection and then use shell\n\ncommands to modify and delete them. You also learn how to implement\n\nuser accounts and authentication to the MongoDB database. You then\n\nlearn about indexes and how to manage them. Finally, you learn how\n\nto build a MongoDB script that can be executed from a console\n\nprompt to access and manipulate documents. This exercise is very\n\nimportant because it builds a database that will be used in Lesson\n\n3.\n\n<br/><br/><b>Lesson 3: Using MongoDB as the Data Store for Node.js\n\nApplications</b><br/>Lesson 3 teaches you how to integrate the MongoDB database\n\ninto your Node.js applications. In this lesson, you learn how to\n\naccess a MongoDB server from your Node.js applications. You create\n\nsome queries that retrieve documents from a collection. Then you\n\nlearn how to limit the amount of data returned from the database.\n\nYou also learn how to sort the documents returned. Next, you use\n\nthe MongoDB aggregation pipeline to aggregate data before\n\nretrieving it from the server. Finally, you learn how to add,\n\nremove and update documents in a collection.\n\n<br/><b>Lesson 4: Using Express as the Node.js Web Server</b><br/><br/>Lesson 4 dives into using the Node.js module Express to\n\nimplement web servers. You learn how to start the server, handle\n\nvarious types of routes and serve static files. Next, you learn how\n\nto handle parameters in a query. Then you get a chance to implement\n\ntemplates and a template engine to deliver dynamic content. You\n\nalso learn how to handle JSON data in both requests and responses.\n\nFinally, you learn how to implement and manage sessions to store\n\ndata between client requests.\n\n<br/><br/><b>Lesson 5: AngularJS Framework Fundamentals</b><br/>Lesson 5 introduces you to using the AngularJS platform to\n\nextend HTML and build client applications. The lesson begins by\n\nhelping you create your first AngularJS application. Then you learn\n\nhow to bind data from the model to HTML elements. You also learn\n\nhow to build your own custom directives. Next, you learn how to use\n\nthe built-in directives to extend HTML. You then learn how to use\n\nthe AngularJS http service to communicate with the server via AJAX.\n\nFinally, you learn how to build your own custom services that can\n\nbe re-used in your AngularJS applications.\n\n<br/><br/><b>Lesson 6: Implementing the Full Node.js, MongoDB, and AngularJS\n\nStack to Add User Authentication to a Web Site</b><br/>Lesson 6 combines the concepts from all the previous lessons\n\ntogether to build a Node.js, MongoDB, and AngularJS solution that\n\nprovides user accounts and authentication to a web site. In the\n\nfirst step, you build the application server, routes and views.\n\nNext, you add session support to the server to store authentication\n\nstate between requests. Then you build the server-side component to\n\nstore and retrieve user data in the MongoDB database. Finally, you\n\nimplement the necessary AngularJS components to handle interaction\n\nwith the server to update the user data.\n\n<br/><br/><b>Lesson 7: Implementing the Full Node.js, MongoDB, and AngularJS\n\nStack to Provide a Dynamic View of Backend Data</b><br/>In Lesson 7, you use the full Node.js, MongoDB, and AngularJS\n\nstack to access and display data from the MongoDB database in a\n\ndynamic view. You begin by creating a dynamic HTML table that is\n\nbound to data from the MongoDB database. Then you add the\n\ncapability to page through entries in the collection. Next, you add\n\nthe capability to filter data in the application. Finally, you add\n\na sort feature to sort the document based on different field\n\nvalues.\n\n<br/><br/><b>About LiveLessons</b><br/>The LiveLessons Video Training series publishes hundreds of\n\nhands-on, expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of\n\ntechnology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to\n\nsucceed.

    "description": "<span><span><strong>4+ Hours of Video Instruction</strong><br/><br/>\nJavaScript started as a basic language for performing simple computations on web pages, but it’s now become one of the most popular—if not the most popular—programming language. Over the past few years, it’s become possible to do pretty much anything using only JavaScript: We can write entire front-end applications using React, Angular, or Vue. We can create JavaScript servers using Node.js. We can make JavaScript-driven desktop apps using Electron. We can even develop mobile apps in JavaScript using React Native. In other words, JavaScript has become the common tongue of the software-development world, making it possible for a single developer with a single programming language to build programs that only a few years ago would have required an entire department.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Join Shaun Wassell and take a journey into the universe of modern JavaScript. This LiveLessons offers manageable, thorough, step-by-step guides to learning and mastering modern JavaScript.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Description</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Learn JavaScript LiveLessons</strong> gives first-time JavaScript users what they need to become successful developers. Shaun Wassell offers a modern, full-fledged introduction to JavaScript. In particular, the viewer will learn the modern syntax of JavaScript: ES6. Shaun delivers step-by-step guidance that will take the learner from the basic syntax and concepts of JavaScript, all the way through the more advanced concepts that are covered in technical interviews.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>About the Instructor</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n  Shaun Wassell's goal is to create a world where people are empowered to use programming as a way to solve meaningful problems, a world where writing code is just as natural for most people as walking or breathing. To make this a reality, he has dedicated the past few years to helping people learn and master software development skills through video courses for LinkedIn Learning, Pearson live training sessions, and one-on-one tutoring. Shaun has been programming since he was a kid, when creating video games was his gateway into the world of software. Since then, he‚Äôs been fortunate enough to be a contributing member on many amazing software projects and work with some incredible mentors along the way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Skill Level</strong><br/>\n<ul><li>Beginning to Intermediate</li></ul>\n<strong>What You Will Learn</strong><br/>\n<ul><li>Learn modern JavaScript from the ground up</li><li>Build a basic server using JavaScript and Node.js</li><li>Master the best practices of modern JavaScript</li><li>Write high-quality, readable code</li><li>Skillfully answer technical interview questions</li><li>Write and run modern JavaScript programs</li><li>Learn how to take advantage of recent language additions</li><li>Master the finer points of JavaScript ES6+</li></ul>\n<strong>Who Should Take This Course</strong><br/>\n<ul><li>Junior software developers</li><li>Software engineers</li><li>Full-stack developers</li><li>Front-end developers</li><li>Back-end developers</li></ul>\n<strong>Course Requirements</strong>\n<br/>\nPrerequisites:\n<ul><li>Basic knowledge of how programming works</li><li>Some experience with command line (not required)</li></ul>\n<br/>\n<strong>About Pearson Video Training</strong>\n<br/>\nPearson publishes expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

Nowadays, JavaScript programmers actively embrace functional, object-oriented, and asynchronous programming, while deprecating error-prone concepts from the past. <i><b>Modern JavaScript for the Impatient</b></i> is a complete yet concise guide to JavaScript E6 and beyond. Rather than first requiring you to learn and transition from older versions, it helps you quickly get productive with today's far more powerful versions and rapidly move from languages such as Java, C#, C, or C++.</p><p>Bestselling programming author Cay S. Horstmann covers all you need to know, provided in small chunks organized for quick access and easy understanding. Horstmann's practical insights and sample code help you take advantage of all that's new, avoid common pitfalls and obsolete features, and make the most of modern JavaScript's robust toolchains and frameworks.</p><ul><li>Quickly master modern JavaScript's implementation of fundamental programming constructs</li><li>Avoid legacy techniques that create unnecessary complexity and risk</li><li>Make the most of functional, object-oriented, and asynchronous techniques</li><li>Use modules to efficiently organize and run complex programs</li><li>Write more powerful, flexible, and concise programs with metaprogramming</li><li>Extend JavaScript's power via JavaScript libraries, frameworks, and platforms</li></ul><p>Whether you're just getting started with JavaScript or you're an experienced developer, this guide will help you write tomorrow's most robust, efficient, and secure JavaScript code.<br/><br/><i>Register your book for convenient access to downloads, updates, and/or corrections as they become available.

This practical guide shows you how to write unit tests with Jasmine that automatically check for bugs in your application. If you have JavaScript experience—with knowledge of some advanced features—you’ll learn how to write specifications for individual components, and then use those specs to test the code you write.</p><p>Throughout the book, author Evan Hahn focuses primarily on methods for testing browser-based JavaScript applications, but you’ll also discover how to use Jasmine with CoffeeScript, Node.js, Ruby on Rails, and Ruby without Rails. You won’t find a more in-depth source for Jasmine anywhere.</p><ul><li>Get an overview of both test-driven and behavior-driven development</li><li>Write useful specs by determining what you need to test—and what you don’t</li><li>Test the behavior of new and existing code against the specs you create</li><li>Apply Jasmine matchers and discover how to build your own</li><li>Organize code suites into groups and subgroups as your code becomes more complex</li><li>Use a Jasmine spy in place of a function or an object—and learn why it’s valuable</li></ul></div></span></span>",

With the coding know-how contained here you’ll have a lot more power to your programmer’s elbow. For beginners or intermediates.</p><ul><li>Learn to think in JavaScript, the language of the web browser</li><li>Object-oriented programming made accessible and understandable to web developers</li><li>Do it yourself: experiment with examples that can be used in your own scripts</li><li>Write better, more maintainable JavaScript code</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Once listed in the \"nice to have\" sections of job postings, these days the knowledge of JavaScript is a deciding factor when it comes to hiring web developers. And rightly so. Where in the past we used to have the occasional few lines of JavaScript embedded in a web page, now we have advanced libraries and extensible architectures, powering the \"fat-client\", AJAX-type rich internet applications.</p><p>JavaScript is the language of the browser, but it's also heavily employed in many other environments: server-side programming, desktop applications, application extensions and widgets. It's a pretty good deal: you learn one language and then code all kinds of different applications. While this book has one chapter specifically dedicated to the web browser environment including DOM, events, and AJAX tutorials, the rest is applicable to all the other environments too.</p><p>This book treats JavaScript as a serious object-oriented language, showing you how to build robust, maintainable, and powerful libraries and applications. Along the way, we cover many of the recent innovations such as AJAX, JSON, and interesting design and coding patterns. After reading this book, you'll be prepared to ace your JavaScript job interview and even impress with some bits that the interviewer maybe didn't know. You should read this book if you want to be able to take your JavaScript skills to a new level of sophistication.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Node.js. It’s the latest in a long line of “Are you cool enough to use me?” programming languages, APIs, and toolkits. In that sense, it lands squarely in the tradition of Rails, and Ajax, and Hadoop, and even to some degree iPhone programming and HTML5.<br/><br/>Dig a little deeper, and you’ll hear that Node.js (or, as it’s more briefly called by many, simply “Node”) is a server-side solution for JavaScript, and in particular, for receiving and responding to HTTP requests. If that doesn’t completely boggle your mind, by the time the conversation heats up with discussion of ports, sockets, and threads, you’ll tend to glaze over. Is this really JavaScript? In fact, why in the world would anyone want to run JavaScript outside of a browser, let alone the server?<br/><br/>The good news is that you’re hearing (and thinking) about the right things. Node really is concerned with network programming and server-side request/response processing. The bad news is that like Rails, Ajax, and Hadoop before it, there’s precious little clear information available. There will be, in time — as there now is for these other “cool” frameworks that have matured — but why wait for a book or tutorial when you might be able to use Node today, and dramatically improve the maintainability.</p></span>",

The push model allows you to eliminate polling for data that may not even be available. Splitting the business logic into separate functions makes the code easier to read and modify.

This self-paced tutorial includes over 7 hours of video teaching, neatly broken into digestible 5-7 minute lessons. If you've been struggling to wrap your head around ES6, or you're just looking for a fast way to level-up your JavaScript, it's time to get moving.</p>\n<b>ES6, aka ECMAScript 2015</b>, is the latest JavaScript language standard, offering dozens of powerful new language features. ES6 introduces proper classes, template strings, types, full support for Unicode, and more. For developers working with Node on server-side applications, the ES6 support for promises, arrow functions, and modules is a game-changer. ES6 keeps the simplicity and reliability you love about JavaScript, and adds the high-value professional language features you've been craving.\n<br/><br/>\nWhat you will learn:\n<ul><li>Use arrow functions to write functional code\n</li><li>Clean apps using modules, classes, and variable scoping\n</li><li>Master asynchronous programming with promises\n</li><li>Rebuild arrays and objects with destructuring\n</li></ul>\n\nThis course is suitable for developers comfortable with using client-side JavaScript or Node.js. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Wes Higbee</b> is an experienced teacher and developer with two decades of JavaScript under his belt.\n<br/><br/>\n<i>This is a good introduction to the new changes coming to ES6. The course is well organized and covers a very good range of topics.</i><br/>\nVijay Patel, Front-End Engineer<br/><br/>\n<i>A valuable addition for everyone who is fresh to JavaScript, and more seasoned developers who are not familiar with all new ES6 features.</i><br/>\nArne de Wall, Software Developer<br/><br/>\n  </span>",

You've found the right book to get started quickly and dive deep into the essence of modern JavaScript. Learn practical tips to apply the elegant parts of the language and the gotchas to avoid.</p><p>JavaScript is a black swan that no one, including the author of the language, thought would become a popular and ubiquitous language. Not long ago, it was the most hated and feared language you could use to program the web. JavaScript ES6 and beyond has gone through a significant makeover. Troublesome features have been replaced with better, elegant, more reliable alternatives. This book includes many practical examples and exercises to help you learn in depth. It will not bore you with idiosyncrasies and arcane details intended for bad interview questions. Instead, it takes you into key features that you can readily use in your day-to-day projects.</p><p>Whether you program the frontend or the server side, you can now write concise, elegant, and expressive JavaScript with newer features like default parameters, template literals, rest and spread operators, destructuring, arrow functions, and generators. Take it up a notch with features like infinite series, promises, async, and metaprogramming to create flexible, powerful, and extensible libraries. While the evolved features of the language will draw you in, the hundreds of examples in this book will pin the concepts down, for you to use on your projects. Take command of modern JavaScript and unlock your potential to create powerful applications.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>To try out the examples in the book you will need a computer with Node.js, a text editor, and a browser like Chrome installed in it.</p></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><strong>Nearly 4 Hours of Video Instruction</strong><br/><br/>\n\nShaun Wassell covers what developers need to successfully create and manage front-end codebases using Vue.js, currently one of the most popular front-end JavaScript frameworks.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Description</strong>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nVue allows developers to create beautiful, performant, and easily maintainable websites incredibly quickly. It also has the added benefit of allowing developers to incorporate the code into their sites incrementally. For some time, Vue.js was almost hidden in obscurity by the overwhelming amount of attention given to React and Angular. But lately, the number of people talking about, writing about, and building great apps with Vue.js has exploded. Vue.js is an incredibly simple and approachable framework. It works well when simply adding interactivity to a page, and it is more than appropriate for “full-scale” apps.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Learn Vue.js Essentials LiveLessons</strong> is a hands-on, comprehensive guide to learning and mastering the Vue library, including screen-casting, slides, and hands-on coding demonstrations.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nDownload the code associated for this LiveLesson from <a href=\"https://github.com/shaunwa/vue-livelessons\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/shaunwa/vue-livelessons</a>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>About the Instructor</strong>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Shaun Wassell</strong> is a senior software developer who specializes in full-stack development and software architecture. He manages teams of developers, as well as teaches many hundreds of thousands more how to create enterprise-ready applications.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nShaun’s online courses have more than 300,000 learners, largely because of his passion for development and his focus on helping people apply their programming skills in the real world. He is a life-long programmer and problem-solving addict whose goal is to help people solve meaningful problems by mastering the art of software development. Please don’t hesitate to get in touch with him about any opportunities or if you’d like to stay up-to-date on his other courses and live trainings.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Skill Level</strong>\n<ul><li>Beginner to Intermediate</li></ul>\n<strong>What You Will Learn</strong>\n<ul><li>Code a full-scale Vue application</li><li>Build and deploy this application so that it can be accessed from anywhere</li><li>Learn to recognize good and bad patterns in Vue code</li><li>Use composition to increase code reuse and flexibility</li><li>Learn about directives and how they work</li></ul>\n<strong>Who Should Take This Course</strong>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nSoftware developers who are familiar with the basics of web development, such as HTML, CSS, basic JavaScript, and who want to increase their effectiveness and make their skills relevant again by learning the modern way of developing websites using Vue.\n\n<ul><li>Software developers</li><li>Web developers</li><li>Full-stack developers</li><li>Front-end developers</li></ul>\n\nSecondary audience: Developers who have never done any kind of web development before and want to jump into the most advanced technology.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Course Requirements</strong>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nLearners should know the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and have a strong understanding of basic programming concepts, such as variables, arrays, control flow, etc.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>About Pearson Video Training</strong>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nPearson publishes expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

If you simply want to be productive with JavaScript as it exists today, then you don’t want to relive history with books or courses that teach older JavaScript versions, or that assume familiarity with those older versions and focus on recently introduced features.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis course assumes that you are a competent programmer who understands branches and loops, functions, data structures, and the basics of object-oriented programming. You will get up to speed with modern JavaScript in the shortest possible time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Description</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Modern JavaScript for the Impatient LiveLessons</strong> focuses on how to be productive with JavaScript as it exists today. After reviewing the fundamentals of values, variables, and control flow, the video thoroughly covers functions, objects, and classes. The standard library and the most commonly used tools are also covered, as well as key topics related to asynchronous programming, internationalization, and modules.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Related Content</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nThis training pairs with Cay Horstmann’s book <a href=\"http://www.informit.com/store/modern-javascript-for-the-impatient-9780136502142\"><strong>Modern JavaScript for the Impatient</strong></a>(9780136502142)\n<br/>\n<strong>About the Instructor</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cay S.

    "title": "JavaScript Application Cookbook",
    "description": "<span><span><span><span><div><p>There is a serious information gap for Webmasters learning client-side JavaScript skills and trying to solve common Web-related problems. Knowing the syntax is one thing, being able to build a useful application is another. And while there are dozens of \"how- to\" JavaScript books available, few literally hand the Webmaster a set of ready-to-go, client-side JavaScript applications with thorough documentation that enable the reader to fully understand and extend those applications. By providing such a set of applications, <em>JavaScript Application Cookbook</em> allows Webmasters to immediately add extra functionality to their Web sites. This book targets readers with two different skill sets. The primary target is JavaScript-knowledgeable Webmasters and designers who can immediately begin constructing their own versions of the applications. The secondary target is those with little or no JavaScript experience. The included applications are ready for immediate use and require little customization. This book explores both the code and the techniques that are centered around core JavaScript functionality, a functionality that will not become incompatible or obsolete. The source file design of most applications and libraries will help modularize reader Web sites and facilitate easier site management and coding practices. Chapters are organized by application. Among the included applications are:</p><ul><li><p>A client-side search engine that will show coders how to build their own search engine and get excellent results, all with a client-side tool</p></li><li><p>A drag-and-drop greeting application that lets users custom build and send DHTML email greetings</p></li><li><p>A GUI image rollover tool that generates cross-browser image rollover code for all versions of JavaScript</p></li><li><p>A robust client-side shopping cart application that lets shoppers browse and shop, while the application keeps a tab of the shopper's selections and a running bill, including tax and shipping</p></li><li><p>An online test application that auto-administers, grades, and displays answers to online exams or surveys</p></li></ul><p>An additional value to this book is an online resource (http://www.serve.com/hotsyte/) that discusses the applications and points to other resources. With its focus on providing practical real-world solutions for Webmasters, <em>JavaScript Application Cookbook</em> is destined to become a staple for every JavaScript developer, regardless of experience.</p></div>Visit the catalog page for JavaScript Application CookbookVisit the errata page for JavaScript Application CookbookDownload the supplemental content for JavaScript Application Cookbook</span></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>JavaScript lies at the heart of almost every modern web application, from social apps like Twitter to browser-based game frameworks like Phaser and Babylon. Though simple for beginners to pick up and play with, JavaScript is a flexible, complex language that you can use to build full-scale applications.</p><p>This much anticipated and thoroughly revised third edition of<i> Eloquent JavaScript</i> dives deep into the JavaScript language to show you how to write beautiful, effective code. It has been updated to reflect the current state of Java¬Script and web browsers and includes brand-new material on features like class notation, arrow functions, iterators, async functions, template strings, and block scope. A host of new exercises have also been added to test your skills and keep you on track.</p><p>As with previous editions, Haverbeke continues to teach through extensive examples and immerses you in code from the start, while exercises and full-chapter projects give you hands-on experience with writing your own programs. You start by learning the basic structure of the JavaScript language as well as control structures, functions, and data structures to help you write basic programs. Then you’ll learn about error handling and bug fixing, modularity, and asynchronous programming before moving on to web browsers and how JavaScript is used to program them. As you build projects such as an artificial life simulation, a simple programming language, and a paint program, you’ll learn how to:</p><p>•Understand the essential elements of programming, including syntax, control, and data<br/>•Organize and clarify your code with object-oriented and functional programming techniques<br/>•Script the browser and make basic web applications<br/>•Use the DOM effectively to interact with browsers<br/>•Harness Node.js to build servers and utilities</p><p>Isn’t it time you became fluent in the language of the Web?</p><p><i>All source code is available online in an interactive sandbox, where you can edit the code, run it, and see its output instantly.</i></p></div></span></span>",

From easily adding it to an existing website or application to just control a part of it, such as adding new components, through to using it for medium or large single-page applications, you can improve productivity in several ways.</p><p>The course will guide you through building two challenging yet exciting projects, which will help you apply everything you learn.</p><p>You’ll begin with a guest list app where users can add their name to an event guest list. Although this is a simple app, you’ll learn several Vue.js essentials while building it such as two-way data binding, event handling, templates and the Virtual DOM, and instance properties - data, computed, watchers, methods, and filters.</p><p>You will then build on your knowledge by creating a greeting card application where users can create and edit their custom greeting card. They will be able to add their text and images to create a personalised card. This project will get you up to speed with components (local, global, and single file), installing Node and NPM, passing data with $emit, and storing and retrieving images from Firebase. In addition to this, you’ll make use of Vue CLI to scaffold your projects with build tools such as Webpack and Babel.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will be well-versed with Vue.js and have gained hands-on experience in applying it effectively in your projects.</p></span>",

You may end up wasting time on out-of-date courses and incomplete YouTube tutorials that talk about JavaScript features without effectively demonstrating how to use them for building real-world applications. Sounds familiar?</p><p>The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp (2019) starts with the basics and gradually builds on your knowledge of the JavaScript language. You'll not only learn the features of the language, but also how to use those features together to develop a complete application.</p><p>As you progress, you’ll cover modern ES6 and ES7 JavaScript features used in the real world. Next, you’ll build three JavaScript applications, before going on to discovering the 80 challenges designed to help you get started with writing code, adding app features, and solving different problems.

Learn to write modern JavaScript not by memorizing a list of new syntax, but with practical examples of how syntax changes can make code more expressive. Starting from variable declarations that communicate intention clearly, see how modern principles can improve all parts of code. Incorporate ideas with curried functions, array methods, classes, and more to create code that does more with less while yielding fewer bugs.</p><p>It's time to write JavaScript code that's clean and exprssive. Modern JavaScript is simpler and more predictable and readable than ever. Discover how to write better code with clear examples using principles that show how updated syntax can make code better with fewer bugs.</p><p>Starting from the ground up, learn new syntax (or how to reuse older syntax) to transform code from clunky bug-susceptible scripts to clear and elegant programs that are easy to read and easy to extend.</p><p>Create a foundation for readable code with simple variable declarations that reduce side effects and subtle bugs. Select collections with clear goals instead of defaulting to objects or arrays. See how to simplify iterations from complex loops to single line array methods. Master techniques for writing flexible and solid code ranging from high-order functions, to reusableclasses, to patterns for architecting large applications creating applications that will last while through rounds of refactoring and changing requirements.</p><p>The best part is there's no need to read this book straight through. Jump around and incorporate new functionality at will. Most importantly, understand not just what the new syntax is, but when and how to use it. Start writing better code from the first page.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>For the best experience, have the latest version of Node installed (at least version 7). You can test most examples in the console of Chrome or other modern web browser.

We cover the traditional way of building Vue apps-the Options API-as well as the new Composition API and even see how you can mix and match them together.</p><p>There are 8 modules in this course; 4 introduce fundamental skills (Options API, Composition API, Vuex, and Vue Router). The remaining four modules are projects so that you can see how to apply the fundamental skills in real apps.</p><p>After learning both Options and Composition API, we will see how to use them both with Vuex and Vue Router and talk about the different use-cases and trade-offs to consider.</p><p>Finally, as we progress through, our focus starts to shift from not only how to build apps with Vue but also to thinking about how we architect things, how components should communicate, where data should be saved (also known as state management), and how it flows through the app.</p><p>After covering Vue, we will look at Vuex, Vue's state management solution, and Vue Router, for front-end routing. The course culminates with a capstone project, using the three core Vue libraries (Vue, Vuex, Vue Router) to build an application.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will gain a solid foundation in coding with Vue.js and apply these skills in your future projects.</p><p><b>Audience</b></p><p>This course is suitable for beginner- or intermediate-level web developers. Developers looking to try out new Vue.js 3 features can also opt for this course.</p><p>Basic knowledge of web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS) and terminal proficiency is required.</p></span>",

Project 1 - Vidjot An application where content creators can register and jot down and manage ideas for future videos.The first project is quite simple as it is meant to be an introduction where the author explains everything about Express routing, middleware, templates, Mongoose, and so on. We implement Passport and a local strategy where we store emails as usernames and encrypted passwords in our database. We will prepare and deploy this app to Heroku and add a domain name. Project 2 - Storybooks: A much more sophisticated project. A social network for creating public and private stories. This app uses a Google OAuth 2.0 strategy for authentication. Users can login and create stories which can be set to public or private. They can also choose if comments are allowed to be posted. We will create a dashboard for users to manage their stories. We will create helpers for authentication and access control as well as handlebars template helpers.

It allows you to create efficient code, enabling a more sustainable way of writing software made of only one language across the full stack, along with extreme levels of reusability, pragmatism, simplicity, and collaboration. Node.js is revolutionizing the web and the way people and companies create their software.</p><p>In this book, we will take you on a journey across various ideas and components, and the challenges you would commonly encounter while designing and developing software using the Node.js platform. You will also discover the \"Node.js way\" of dealing with design and coding decisions.</p><p>The book kicks off by exploring the fundamental principles and components that define the platform. It then shows you how to master asynchronous programming and how to design elegant and reusable components using well-known patterns and techniques. The book rounds off by teaching you the various approaches to scale, distribute, and integrate your Node.js application.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Design and implement a series of server-side JavaScript patterns so you understand why and when to apply them in different use case scenarios</li><li>Understand the fundamental Node.js components and use them to their full potential</li><li>Untangle your modules by organizing and connecting them coherently</li><li>Reuse well-known solutions to circumvent common design and coding issues</li><li>Deal with asynchronous code with comfort and ease</li><li>Identify and prevent common problems, programming errors, and anti-patterns</li></ul><p>Downloading the example code for this book.

Build tools, package managers, loaders, bundlers, linters, compilers, transpilers, typecheckers - how do you make sense of it all?\n</p><p>In this book, we will build a simple API and React application from scratch. We begin by setting up our development environment using Git, yarn, Babel, and ESLint. Then, we will use Express, Elasticsearch and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to build a stateless API service. For the front-end, we will use React, Redux, and Webpack.\n</p><p>A central theme in the book is maintaining code quality. As such, we will enforce a Test-Driven Development (TDD) process using Selenium, Cucumber, Mocha, Sinon, and Istanbul. As we progress through the book, the focus will shift towards automation and infrastructure. You will learn to work with Continuous Integration (CI) servers like Jenkins, deploying services inside Docker containers, and run them on Kubernetes.\n</p><p>By following this book, you would gain the skills needed to build robust, production-ready applications.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Practice Test-Driven Development (TDD) throughout the entire book\n</li><li>Use Cucumber, Mocha and Selenium to write E2E, integration, unit and UI tests\n</li><li>Build stateless APIs using Express and Elasticsearch\n</li><li>Document your API using OpenAPI and Swagger\n</li><li>Build and bundle front-end applications using React, Redux and Webpack\n</li><li>Containerize services using Docker\n</li><li>Deploying scalable microservices using Kubernetes</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>If you're a JavaScript developer looking to expand your skillset and become a senior JavaScript developer by building production-ready web applications, then this book is for you.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book You can download the example code files for all Packt books you have purchased from your account at http://www.PacktPub.com.

Whether you use Node.js, Express, MongoDB, jQuery, AngularJS, or directly manipulate the DOM, you can test-drive JavaScript. Learn the craft of writing meaningful, deterministic automated tests with Karma, Mocha, and Chai. Test asynchronous JavaScript, decouple and properly mock out dependencies, measure code coverage, and create lightweight modular designs of both server-side and client-side code. Your investment in writing tests will pay high dividends as you create code that's predictable and cost-effective to change.<br/><br/>Design and code JavaScript applications with automated tests. Writing meaningful tests is a skill that takes learning, some unlearning, and a lot of practice, and with this book, you'll hone that skill. Fire up the editor and get hands-on through practical exercises for effective automated testing and designing maintainable, modular code.<br/><br/>Start by learning when and why to do manual testing vs. automated verification. Focus tests on the important things, like the pre-conditions, the invariants, complex logic, and gnarly edge cases. Then begin to design asynchronous functions using automated tests. Carefully decouple and mock out intricate dependencies such as the DOM, geolocation API, file and database access, and Ajax calls to remote servers.<br/><br/>Step by step, test code that uses Node.js, Express, MongoDB, jQuery, and AngularJS. Know when and how to use tools such as Chai, Istanbul, Karma, Mocha, Protractor, and Sinon. Create tests with minimum effort and run them fast without having to spin up web servers or manually edit HTML pages to run in browsers. Then explore end-to-end testing to ensure all parts are wired and working well together.<br/><br/>Don't just imagine creating testable code, write it.<br/><br/><b>What You Need:</b><br/><br/>A computer with a text editor and your favorite browser. The book provides instructions to install the necessary automated testing-related tools.</p></span>",

    "title": "Reactive Programming with RxJS 5",
    "description": "<span><div><p>Reactive programming is revolutionary. It makes asynchronous programming clean, intuitive, and robust. Use RxJS 5 to write complex programs in a simple way, and master the Observable: a powerful data type that substitutes callbacks and promises. Think about your programs as streams of data that change and adapt to produce what you want. Manage real-world concurrency and write complex flows of events in your applications with ease. Take advantage of Schedulers to make asynchronous testing easier. The code in this new edition is completely updated for RxJS 5 and ES6.</p><p>Create concurrent applications with ease using RxJS 5, a powerful event composition library. Real-world JavaScript applications require you to master asynchronous programming, and chances are that you'll spend more time coordinating asynchronous events than writing actual functionality. This book introduces concepts and tools that will greatly simplify the process of writing asynchronous programs.</p><p>Find out about Observables, a unifying data type that simplifies concurrent code and eases the pain of callbacks. Learn how Schedulers change the concept of time itself, making asynchronous testing sane again. Find real-world examples for the browser and Node.js along the way: how about a real-time earthquake visualization in 20 lines of code, or a frantic shoot-'em-up space videogame? You'll also use Cycle.js - a modern, reactive, web framework - to make a new breed of web applications.</p><p>By the end of the book, you'll know how to think in a reactive way, and to use RxJS 5 to build complex programs and create amazing reactive user interfaces. You'll also understand how to integrate it with your existing projects and use it with the frameworks you already know. All the code in this new edition has been thoroughly revised and updated for RxJS 5, ES6, and Cycle.js Unified.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p><br/><br/>NodeJS 6.x and a modern web browser</p></div></span>",

With this environment in mind, the new edition of this book offers bite-sized solutions to very specific scripting problems that web developers commonly face. Each recipe includes a focused piece of code that you can insert right into your application.<br/><br/>Why is <em>JavaScript &amp; DHTML Cookbook</em> so popular? After reading thousands of forum threads over the years, author and scripting pioneer Danny Goodman has compiled a list of problems that frequently vex scripters of various experience levels. For every problem he addresses, Goodman not only offers code, but a discussion of how and why the solution works. Recipes range from simple tasks, such as manipulating strings and validating dates in JavaScript, to entire libraries that demonstrate complex tasks, such as cross-browser positioning of HTML elements, sorting tables, and implementing Ajax features on the client.<br/><br/>Ideal for novices as well as experienced scripters, this book contains more than 150 recipes for:</p><ul><li>Working with interactive forms and style sheets</li><li>Presenting user-friendly page navigation</li><li>Creating dynamic content via Document Object Model scripting</li><li>Producing visual effects for stationary content</li><li>Positioning HTML elements</li><li>Working with XML data in the browser</li></ul>Recipes in this Cookbook are compatible with the latest W3C standards and browsers, including Internet Explorer 7, Firefox 2, Safari, and Opera 9. Several new recipes provide client-side Ajax solutions, and many recipes from the previous edition have been revised to help you build extensible user interfaces for Web 2.0 applications. If you want to write your own scripts and understand how they work, rather than rely on a commercial web development framework, the <em>JavaScript &amp; DHTML Cookbook</em> is a must.</div></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>If you’ve limited or no experience with JavaScript, this book will put you on the road to being an expert. A wonderfully compiled introduction to objects in JavaScript, it teaches through examples and practical play.</p><ul><li>Think in JavaScript</li><li>Make object-oriented programming accessible and understandable to web developers</li><li>Apply design patterns to solve JavaScript coding problems </li><li>Learn coding patterns that unleash the unique power of the language</li><li>Write better and more maintainable JavaScript code</li><li>Type in and play around with examples that can be used in your own scripts</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>JavaScript is the behavior, the third pillar in today's paradigm that looks at web pages as something that consists of clearly distinguishable parts: content (HTML), presentation (CSS) and behavior (JavaScript). Using JavaScript, you can create not only web pages but also desktop widgets, browser and application extensions, and other pieces of software. It's a pretty good deal: you learn one language and then code all kinds of different applications. While there's one chapter specifically dedicated to the web browser environment including DOM, Events and AJAX tutorials, the rest is applicable to the other environments</p><p>Many web developers have tried coding or adopting some bits of JavaScript, but it is time to \"\"man up\"\" and learn the language properly because it is the language of the browser and is, virtually, everywhere. This book starts from zero, not assuming any prior JavaScript programming knowledge and takes you through all the in-depth and exciting futures hidden behind the facade.</p><p>Once listed in the \"nice to have\" sections of job postings, these days the knowledge of JavaScript is a deciding factor when it comes to hiring web developers. After reading this book you'll be prepared to ace your JavaScript job interview and even impress with some bits that the interviewer maybe didn't know. You should read this book if you want to be able to take your JavaScript skills to a new level of sophistication.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p>Innovative JavaScript behaviors are the hallmark of Web 2.0 interface designs. Visit Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, or any other web titan, and you will find JavaScript implementations providing a smooth, tactile, engaging web experience. Knowledge of JavaScript is essential for developing modern, interactive, sticky web sites, but many beginners are put off by the daunting need to learn a programming language before they can achieve anything.</p><p>This book takes a practical approach by showing you how to use JavaScript in simple stages, starting with the basics of storing and manipulating data and moving on to reacting to events and using JavaScript to alter CSS and HTML on the fly. It assumes no prior knowledge of JavaScript, and avoids bombarding you with unnecessary technical details.</p><p>At the same time, it explains the main points and acts as a reference that you can come back to when you need to refresh your memory. More advanced concepts are introduced gradually, so that by the end of the book you'll have a solid understanding of all the main aspects of JavaScript. Particular attention is paid to debugging and avoiding common beginners' pitfalls, enabling you to create web sites that not only look good, but are dynamic and exciting for visitors.</p><ul><li><p>Requires no previous knowledge of JavaScript</p></li><li><p>Gives you instant results—starts showing how to change values and react to events stage by stage</p></li><li><p>Doesn't bombard you with endless rules and jargon</p></li></ul></span></span></span>",

But there is more power waiting to be unlocked—JavaScript is capable of full object–oriented capabilities, and by applying object-oriented principles, best practices, and design patterns to your code, you can make it more powerful, more efficient, and easier to work with alone or as part of a team.</p><p>With <em>Pro JavaScript Design Patterns</em>, you'll start with the basics of object–oriented programming in JavaScript applicable to design patterns, including making JavaScript more expressive, inheritance, encapsulation, information hiding, and more. With that covered, you can kick–start your JavaScript development in the second part of the book, where you'll find detail on how to implement and take advantage of several design patterns in JavaScript, including composites, decorators, façades, adapters, and many more.</p><p>Each chapter is packed with real–world examples of how the design patterns are best used and expert advice on writing better code, as well as what to watch out for.

Instead of covering the basics, this course will help you to progress to understand advanced concepts such as asynchronicity, the event loop, clean error handling with Express Middleware and functional reactive programming.</p><p>You will start off by working through the process of creating a subscription management system, where you will optimize directory structures. This will help you with the organization, as Node.js apps usually don’t follow filename and directory conventions. As you delve deeper into the course, you’ll learn how to build an API in the form of microservices, managed through PM2. As you progress, you will connect and utilize two of the most widely used technologies in the Node.js World; MySQL, the most commonly used relational database, and Redis, a popular technology used in caching. Once you’ve built a solid infrastructure, you’ll be able to build an authentication service with the help of Passport and JSON Web Tokens.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will be able to tackle harder challenges in your Node.js projects by efficiently using the best tools available, while also meeting demanding industry standards for a clean and scalable code.</p><p><b>Audience</b></p><p>If you are a JavaScript developer with basic experience in Node.js and want to take it to the next level by writing well-managed code for fast, scalable and responsive web applications, this is the course for you.</p></span>",

This guide is aimed at programmers, involved in developing reactive frontend apps, server-side apps that wrangle with reliability and concurrency, and everything in between.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Get a run through of the basic JavaScript language constructs</li><li>Code using the powerful object-oriented feature in JavaScript</li><li>Master DOM manipulation, cross-browser strategies, and ES6</li><li>Understand the basic concurrency constructs in Javascript and best performance strategies</li><li>Harness the power of patterns for tasks ranging from application building to code testing</li><li>Build large-scale apps seamlessly with the help of reactive patterns</li><li>Explore advanced design patterns, including dependency injection</li><li>Develop more powerful applications with currying and function composition</li><li>Create more reliable code with closures and immutable data</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, lightweight, and interpreted programming language and functional programming is a style that emphasizes and enables smarter code that minimizes complexity and increases modularity. It's a way of writing cleaner code through clever ways of mutating, combining, and using functions. And JavaScript provides an excellent medium for this approach. By learning how to expose JavaScript's true identity as a functional language, we can implement web apps that are more powerful, easier to maintain and more reliable.</p><p>The java script: Functional Programming for JavaScript Developers course will take you on a journey to show how functional programming when combined with other techniques makes JavaScript programming more efficient.\n\t\tThe first module Mastering JavaScript, stress on practical aspects of Javascript development like - Functions and Closures, Runtime debugging techniques, project layout, events and DOM processing, build tools, Object-oriented patterns, isomorphism - everything that a modern Javascript project would need.</p><p>The second module, Mastering JavaScript Design Patterns - Second Edition, will explore how design patterns can help you improve and organize your JavaScript code. You'll get to grips with creational, structural, and behavioral patterns as you discover how to put them to work in different scenarios. This updated edition will also delve into reactive design patterns and microservices as they are a growing phenomenon in the world of web development. It will also show you some advanced patterns, including dependency injection and live post processing.</p><p>The third module, Functional Programming in JavaScript, will help you to write real-world applications by utilizing a wide range of functional techniques and styles. It explores the core concepts of functional programming common to all functional languages, with examples of their use in JavaScript.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This course will begin with providing insights and practical tips on advanced JavaScript features to build highly scalable web and mobile system and move on to some design patterns with JavaScript.

    "description": "<span><div><p>How often do you hear people say things like this?<i> \"Our JavaScript is a mess, but we’re thinking about using [framework of the month].\"</i></p><p>Like it or not, JavaScript is not going away. No matter what framework or ”compiles-to-js” language or library you use, bugs and performance concerns will always be an issue if the underlying quality of your JavaScript is poor. Rewrites, including porting to the framework of the month, are terribly expensive and unpredictable. The bugs won’t magically go away, and can happily reproduce themselves in a new context. To complicate things further, features will get dropped, at least temporarily.</p><p>The other popular method of fixing your JS is playing “JavaScript Jenga,” where each developer slowly and carefully takes their best guess at how the out-of-control system can be altered to allow for new features, hoping that this doesn’t bring the whole stack of blocks down. This book provides clear guidance on how best to avoid these pathological approaches to writing JavaScript:</p><ul><li>Recognize you have a problem with your JavaScript quality.</li><li>Forgive the code you have now, and the developers who made it.</li><li>Learn repeatable, memorable, and time-saving refactoring techniques.</li><li>Apply these techniques as you work, fixing things along the way.</li><li>Internalize these techniques, and avoid writing as much problematic code to begin with.</li></ul><p>Bad code doesn’t have to stay that way. And making it better doesn’t have to be intimidating or unreasonably expensive.</p></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>\nJavaScript is a powerful, object-based scripting language;\nJavaScript programs can be embedded directly in HTML web pages.\nWhen combined with the Document Object Model (DOM) defined by a web\nbrowser, JavaScript allows you to create Dynamic HTML content and\ninteractive client-side web applications. JavaScript syntax is\nbased on the popular programming languages C, C++, and Java, which\nmakes it familiar and easy to learn for experienced programmers. At\nthe same time, JavaScript is an interpreted scripting language,\nproviding a flexible, forgiving programming environment in which\nnew programmers can learn. <em>JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</em>\nprovides a thorough description of the core JavaScript language and\nboth the legacy and standard DOMs implemented in web browsers. The\nbook includes sophisticated examples that show you how to handle\ncommon tasks, like validating form data, working with cookies, and\ncreating portable DHTML animations. The book also contains detailed\nreference sections that cover the core JavaScript API, the legacy\nclient-side API, and the W3C standard DOM API, documenting every\nJavaScript object, method, property, constructor, constant,\nfunction, and event handler in those APIs. This fourth edition of\nthe bestselling JavaScript book has been carefully updated to cover\nJavaScript 1.5 (ECMAScript version 3). The book also provides\ncomplete coverage of the W3C DOM standard (Level 1 and Level 2),\nwhile retaining material on the legacy Level 0 DOM for backward\ncompatibility. <em>JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</em> is a\ncomplete programmer's guide and reference manual for JavaScript. It\nis particularly useful for developers working with the latest\nstandards-compliant web browsers, like Internet Explorer 6,\nNetscape 6, and Mozilla. HTML authors can learn how to use\nJavaScript to build dynamic web pages. Experienced programmers can\nquickly find the information they need to start writing\nsophisticated JavaScript programs. This book is an indispensable\nreference for all JavaScript programmers, regardless of experience\nlevel.\n</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><i>Really great introduction to Firebase and how to use each of its components.</i><br/>\nJonathan Wood, Software Engineer<br/><br/>\n<p>In the video course Building Web Applications with Firebase you’ll code along with expert instructor Gareth Brown as you use Firebase to add hosting, cloud storage, database services, and user authentication to a complete music-and-chat web app. The super-reliable Firebase backend-as-a-service handles your app’s data storage and retrieval infrastructure so you can focus on building an amazing user experience.<br/>\n</p><h3>about the subject</h3>\nFor many web apps, the backend functionality—storing, processing, and retrieving data—is predictable. Firebase is a fully managed backend service that gives you best-in-class infrastructure for your web apps, handling everything from user authentication and server scaling, right through to crash analytics and a reliable testing environment. Just set it and forget it. Backed by Google and used by some of the top apps available, you can trust Firebase to work flawlessly every time.<br/><br/>\n<h3>about the video</h3>\n<p>Building Web Applications with Firebase cures the headache of creating—and re-creating—custom backend infrastructure. Code along as expert instructor Gareth Brown creates an entire music-and-chat web app on screen, showing you step-by-step how Firebase can carry the load of your hosting, cloud storage, database services, and user authentication. Each module adds new backend functionality to your app, which you can easily implement with the frontend skills you already know. There are no assumptions made about the rest of your stack; you’ll learn transferable Firebase skills that work seamlessly with your favorite frameworks. When you’re done, you’ll have a fully working app for your portfolio that can show off your new Firebase skills!<br/>\n</p><h3>what you will learn</h3>\n<ul><li>Setup a new project using the Firebase console\n</li><li>Install and use the Firebase SDK\n</li><li>Configure Firebase inside a JavaScript project \n</li><li>Host a website in Firebase\n</li><li>Set up user authentication for user sign in\n</li><li>Save data to the Firestore database\n</li><li>Store audio content in Firebase cloud storage\n</li></ul>\n<h3>prerequisites</h3>\nFor frontend web developers with intermediate JavaScript skills and a basic knowledge of backend requirements.<br/>\n<br/>\n<h3>about the instructor</h3>\n<b>Gareth Brown</b> is a software engineer with years of experience developing all kinds of web applications.<br/><br/>\n<i>If you have no knowledge about Firebase, this is the course for you!</i><br/>\nEmanuele Origgi, Software Developer, Datlas<br/><br/>\n<i>Starts with the fundamentals of Firebase and gives you enough context in order to be able to proceed to the actual platform without further questions.</i><br/>\nKonstantinos Leimonis, Senior Software Engineer, DAZN<br/><br/>\n<i>An easy way to get started with firebase.</i><br/>\nAlex Saez, Full Stack Developer<br/><br/>\n  </span>",

Ext JS combines an extensive library of\nsuper-high-quality widgets, an intuitive, extensible component\nmodel, and an easy-to-use API to create a full, rock-solid platform\nfor JavaScript-based web apps. Ext JS has been adopted by such\nhousehold names as Adobe, Aetna, Amazon.com, Best Buy Hallmark,\nPanasonic, Pixar Animation Studios, Siemens, Sony, and Visa.\n<br/>\n\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t<em>Ext JS in Action</em> teaches the reader about Ext from the\nground up. By following the common design patterns demonstrated in\nthe Ext source and in many commercial applications, the book\nteaches you to achieve the same results you see in world-class\ncommercial JavaScript applications. This book will guide you\nthrough the Ext component model and layouts. You'll learn how core\ncomponents, such as the Container class, serve as building blocks\nfor building complex user interfaces. The book fully covers Ext\nutility classes, AJAX, Observable (the Ext events model), DOM\nhelpers and Function Helpers and illustrates how use of JavaScript\nObject Notation (JSON), a powerful and lightweight data format, can\nallow your application to efficiently communicate over the network\nto the web server. Finally, you'll build on this foundation to\ncustomize or extend Ext widgets.\n<br/>\n\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t<em>Ext JS in Action</em> assumes that you have a solid foundation\nin JavaScript, but requires no previous exposure to Ext JS.\n</p></span>",

Along with HTML and CSS, it is one of the three essential technologies of World Wide Web content production, and is an open source and cross-platform technology. The majority of websites employ JavaScript, and it is well supported by all modern web browsers without plugins. However, the JavaScript landscape has changed dramatically in recent years, and you need to adapt to the new world of JavaScript that people now expect. Mastering modern JavaScript techniques and the toolchain are essential to develop web-scale applications.</p><p>Mastering JavaScript will be your companion as you master JavaScript and build innovative web applications. To begin with, you will get familiarized with the language constructs and how to make code easy to organize. You will gain a concrete understanding of variable scoping, loops, and best practices on using types and data structures, as well as the coding style and recommended code organization patterns in JavaScript. The book will also teach you how to use arrays and objects as data structures. You will graduate from intermediate-level skills to advanced techniques as you come to understand crucial language concepts and design principles. You will learn about modern libraries and tools so you can write better code.</p><p>By the end of the book, you will understand how reactive JavaScript is going to be the new paradigm.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This is a comprehensive guide with a clear focus on practical use cases and patterns. Each chapter consists of best practices, useful advice, and a bunch of easy-to-follow examples that will build up your skills as you advance through the book.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><b>Modularize your JavaScript code for better readability, greater maintainability, and enhanced testability</b></p><p><b>About This Book</b></p><ul><li>Design and build fully modular, modern JavaScript applications using modular design concepts</li><li>Improve code portability, maintainability, and integrity while creating highly scalable and responsive web applications</li><li>Implement your own loosely coupled code blocks that can power highly maintainable and powerful applications in a flexible and highly responsive modular architecture</li></ul><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>If you are an intermediate to advanced JavaScript developer who has experience of writing JavaScript code but probably not in a modular, portable manner, or you are looking to develop enterprise level JavaScript applications, then this book is for you.</p><p>A basic understanding of JavaScript concepts such as OOP, prototypal inheritance, and closures is expected.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Understand the important concepts of OOP in JavaScript, such as scope, objects, inheritance, event delegation, and more</li><li>Find out how the module design pattern is used in OOP in JavaScript</li><li>Design and augment modules using both tight augmentation and loose augmentation</li><li>Extend the capabilities of modules by creating sub-modules using techniques such as cloning and inheritance</li><li>Move from isolated module pieces to a cohesive, well integrated application modules that can interact and work together without being tightly coupled</li><li>See how SandBoxing is used to create a medium for all the modules to talk to each other as well as to the core</li><li>Use the concepts of modular application design to handle dependencies and load modules asynchronously</li><li>Become familiar with AMD and CommonJS utilities and discover what the future of JavaScript holds for modular programming and architecture</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Programming in the modular manner is always encouraged for bigger systems - it is easier to achieve scalability with modular programming. Even JavaScript developers are now interested in building programs in a modular pattern. Modules help people who aren't yet familiar with code to find what they are looking for and also makes it easier for programmers to keep things that are related close together.</p><p>Designing and implementing applications in a modular manner is highly encouraged and desirable in both simple and enterprise level applications.</p><p>This book covers some real-life examples of modules and how we can translate that into our world of programming and application design. After getting an overview of JavaScript object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and their practical usage, you should be able to write your own object definitions using the module pattern. You will then learn to design and augment modules and will explore the concepts of cloning, inheritance, sub-modules, and code extensibility. You will also learn about SandBoxing, application design, and architecture based on modular design concepts. Become familiar with AMD and CommonJS utilities.</p><p>By the end of the book, you will be able to build spectacular modular applications in JavaScript.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This in-depth step-by-step guide will teach you modular programming with JavaScript. Starting from the basics, it will cover advanced modular patterns that can be used in sophisticated JavaScript applications.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><span><span><p>For many years JavaScript was considered a second-league interpreted language with the main purpose of making web pages a little prettier. In reality, JavaScript became the main programming language for the majority of the UI developed for web applications. You can run JavaScript on the server-side too. JavaScript is a flexible, dynamically typed language that supports both object-oriented and functional programming.But mastering JavaScript can present a challenge to developers who started with classical object-oriented languages like Java, C++, or C#, as they quickly find themselves in the Wild West Land of dynamic programming. Why learn JavaScript? First, learning how things are done in a different language makes you a better developer in your primary language. Second, adding JavaScript to your skill set makes you a more valuable software developer.This fast-paced presentation will introduce you to JavaScript, highlighting how it differs from the classical object-oriented way of programming.</p></span></span></span></span></span>",

While similar books focus on either JavaScript as a language of the browser or how to use JavaScript Frameworks, <em>Pro JavaScript with MooTools</em> fills the gap between these topics and moves beyond—exploring the advanced features of JavaScript and how the MooTools framework uses these features to further improve the language itself.</p><p>The book itself takes a unique three-pronged approach. It first walks you through the advanced features of JavaScript and the MooTools framework, including native augmentation and type creation, a comprehensive discussion of JavaScript functions, Object-Oriented programming with native JavaScript and MooTools Classes, and the MooTools Class internals. You'll then learn all about Javascript in the DOM: the Elements classes and its internals, the MooTools Event system, Selector engines and MooTools Slick, Ajax and the Request Object, and Animation and the Fx classes.</p><p>The final section really sets the book apart from all others, as it discusses JavaScript outside the browsers. You'll take an in-depth look at CommonJS and MooTools, using MooTools outside the browser to build ORM, creating simple CommonJS applications via the MooTools Deck framework, and creating complex Server-Side applications using Raccoon.</p></span></span></span></span>",

In contrast, Peter-Paul Koch's book uses eight\nreal-world scripts he created for real-world clients in order to\nearn real-world money.

Then follow practical chapters on\nCore, BOM, Events, DOM, CSS Modification, and Data Retrieval, all\nof which are explained through a combination of theoretical\ninstruction and the taking apart of the relevant sections of the\nexample scripts.</p></span></span>",

The fact that a major part of the app runs inside a single web page makes it very interesting and appealing. Also, the accelerated growth of browser capabilities is pushing us closer to the day when all apps will run entirely in the browser.</p><p>This book will take your JavaScript development skills to the next level by teaching you to create a single-page application within a full-stack JavaScript environment. Using only JavaScript, you can go from being a front-end developer to a full-stack application developer with relative ease.</p><p>You will learn to cross the boundary from front-end development to server-side development through the use of JavaScript on both ends. Use your existing knowledge of JavaScript by learning to manage a JSON document data store with MongoDB, writing a JavaScript powered REST API with Node.js and Express, and designing a front-end powered by AngularJS.</p><p>This book will teach you to leverage the MEAN stack to do everything from document database design, routing REST web API requests, data-binding within views, and adding authentication and security to building a full-fledged, complex, single-page web application.</p><p>In addition to building a full-stack JavaScript app, you will learn to test it with JavaScript-powered testing tools such as Mocha, Karma, and Jasmine. Finally, you will learn about deployment and scaling so that you can launch your own apps into the real world.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>Following a structured approach, this book helps readers gain expertise in SPA development. Its thorough coverage of SPA architecture and design, along with practical use cases, provides readers with a clear path to building applications with the library of their choice. For readers who are afraid to take the plunge straightaway, the book also offers step-by-step guidance on developing a complex web app.</p></span>",

    "title": "Pro Single Page Application Development: Using Backbone.js and ASP.NET",
    "description": "<span><span><p>One of the most important and exciting trends in web development in recent years is the move towards single page applications, or SPAs. Instead of clicking through hyperlinks and waiting for each page to load, the user loads a site once and all the interactivity is handled fluidly by a rich JavaScript front end. If you come from a background in ASP.NET development, you'll be used to handling most interactions on the server side. <em>Pro Single Page Application Development</em> will guide you through your transition to this powerful new application type.</p><p>The book starts in Part I by laying the groundwork for SPA development. You'll master some JavaScript techniques that will come in useful later on, and get to know the building blocks of a single page application, including modules, routing and MV* frameworks.</p><p>In Part II, you'll build the client for your application. This is where the magic happens, as the authors take you through the process step by step. Backbone.js is the ideal library for demonstrating SPA development in practice, but you can apply the same principles with other frameworks in your future applications. Part III takes you through the process of building the server side of your application using ASP.NET Web API, and hooking up the two parts of your application to create a working whole.</p><p>SPA development also comes with its own particular challenges, including tracking history, user interface performance, and how to handle search engine optimization. In the final chapters, the authors guide you through some of these issues and advanced techniques and finish by showing you how to deploy your application. As SPAs become the <em>de facto</em> standard of web application development, the in-depth <em>Pro Single Page Application Development</em> will be your one-stop shop for creating fluid, modern applications on the web.</p><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><li><p>Reasons to master single page application development</p></li><li><p>SPA architecture and key concepts</p></li><li><p>Mastering modular JavaScript development techniques</p></li><li><p>Meet the popular Backbone.js library and how to use it to build an SPA</p></li><li><p>Create a back end with ASP.NET Web API and consume it from your SPA</p></li><li><p>How to unit test and performance tune your application</p></li><li><p>Overcome the difficulties of search engine optimization in single page applications</p></li><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p>This book will suit professional web developers familiar with HTML and JavaScript.

It is the modern day web dev alternative to the old LAMP stack. It works by allowing AngularJS to handle the front end, and selecting Mongo, Express, and Node to handle the back-end development, which makes increasing sense to forward-thinking web developers. The MEAN stack is great if you want to prototype complex web applications.</p><p>This book will enable you to build a better foundation for your AngularJS apps. Each chapter covers a complete, single, advanced end-to-end project. You'll learn how to build complex real-life applications with the MEAN stack and few more advanced projects. You will become familiar with WebSockets and build real-time web applications, as well as create auto-destructing entities. Later, we will combine server-side rendering techniques with a single page application approach. You'll build a fun project and see how to work with monetary data in Mongo. You will also find out how to a build real-time e-commerce application.</p><p>By the end of this book, you will be a lot more confident in developing real-time, complex web applications using the MEAN stack.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This book is filled with independent hands-on projects that teach you how to build real-life end-to-end complex web applications using the MEAN stack.</p></span>",

Loaded with three\nmillion lines of source code, it presents a wealth of programming\nlanguage technology that targets developers interested in the\ninternal workings of the Microsoft .NET Framework, academics\nworking with advanced compiler technology, and people developing\ntheir own CLI implementations. The CLI, at its heart, is an\napproach to building software that enables code from many\nindependent sources to co-exist and interoperate safely. <em>Shared\nSource CLI Essentials</em> is a companion guide to Rotor's code.\nThis concise and insightful volume provides a road map for anyone\nwishing to navigate, understand, or alter the Shared Source CLI\ncode. This book illustrates the design principles used in the CLI\nstandard and discusses the complexities involved when building\nvirtual machines. Included with the book is a CD-ROM that contains\nall the source code and files. After introducing the CLI, its core\nconcepts, and the Shared Source CLI implementation, <em>Shared\nSource CLI Essentials</em> covers these topics:\n</p><ul><li><p>The CLI type system</p></li><li><p>Component packaging and assemblies</p></li><li><p>Type loading and JIT Compilation</p></li><li><p>Managed code and the execution engine</p></li><li><p>Garbage collection and memory management</p></li><li><p>The Platform Adaptation Layer (PAL): a portability layer for\nWin32®, Mac OS® X, and FreeBSD</p></li></ul><p>\nWritten by members of the core Microsoft® team that designed the\n.NET Framework, <em>Shared Source CLI Essentials</em> is for anyone\nwho wants a deeper understanding of what goes on under the hood of\nthe .NET runtime and the ECMA CLI. Advanced .NET programmers,\nresearchers, the academic community, and CLI implementers who have\nasked hard questions about the .NET Framework will find that this\nbehind-the-scenes look at the .NET nucleus provides them with\nexcellent resources from which they can extract answers.\n</p></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><strong>6+ Hours of Video Instruction</strong><br/><br/>\n\nLearn to write performant back-end applications in JavaScript by leveraging the Node.js runtime. Shaun Wassell teaches JavaScript developers how to write and run server-side JavaScript applications for the powerful Node.js runtime. It includes topics such as working with the file system, creating web servers, installing, using, and publishing NPM packages, Google V8 engine, testing, and much more.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Description</strong>\n<br/>\n\nSeveral years ago, it wasn’t possible to write JavaScript programs for the back-end. JavaScript was strictly limited to running in a browser, and if a developer wanted to write back-end software, they had little choice but to learn another programming language, such as PHP. Now, that has all changed. Thanks to Node.js, which allows JavaScript to be run outside the browser, JavaScript developers can write web-servers, server-side scripts, and any number of other useful back-end programs.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nThis LiveLessons video shows developers how to write and run server-side JavaScript applications for the powerful Node.js runtime.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nThe code repository for this LiveLesson can be accessed at <a href=\"https://github.com/shaunwa/node-course\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/shaunwa/node-course</a>.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>About the Instructor</strong>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Shaun Wassell</strong>'s goal is to create a world where people are empowered to use programming as a way to solve meaningful problems--a world where writing code is just as natural for most people as walking or breathing.

    "title": "Modern Asynchronous JavaScript",
    "description": "<span><div><p>JavaScript today must interact with data-intensive APIs and networks. The solution is a program that can work <i>asynchronously</i> instead of finishing tasks in order. In modern JavaScript, instead of callbacks you'll use promises to improve your application's performance and responsiveness. JavaScript features introduced in ES2020, ES2021, and ESNext like Promise.allSettled(), Promise.any(), and top-level await help you develop small, fast, low-profile applications. With the AbortController API, cancel a pending async request before it has completed. <i>Modern Asynchronous JavaScript</i> gives you an arsenal of tools to build programs that always respond to user requests, recover quickly from difficult conditions, and deliver maximum performance.</p><p>Applications today must work with information on remote servers, and users expect a quick response to complex interactions at all times, whether on a high-speed 5G cellular network or slow public WiFi. JavaScript provides developers with advanced tools to coordinate the asynchronous parts of their code efficiently and deliver responsive programs. Faster applications equal happier users, which is the promise of asynchronous JavaScript.</p><p>With <i>Modern Asynchronous JavaScript</i> you'll learn techniques for managing your async code. Features like ES2021 Promise.any() allow you to safeguard your async code from external issues that are out of your control like server downtime. You'll discover secret weapons like top-level await to initialize resources, define dependency paths dynamically, and load dependencies with a fallback implementation. You'll even learn to how to set a time limit for async requests and react if they take too long to complete.</p><p>Fast, reliable applications are a must in today's world, where users demand increasingly greater amounts of data on mobile devices. Asynchronous programming may require more cautious planning than synchronous programming but the outcome is rewarding. Asynchronous JavaScript allows you to write code that is nimble but reliable, leading to programs that load faster, respond quicker, and most importantly that you can trust to function properly.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>You'll need an intermediate level of JavaScript programming skills and a browser that supports features from ES2020, ES2021, and ESNext.</p></div></span>",

The language is a staple in most of the front-ends; if not vanilla JavaScript, you won’t be surprised to find one of its derivatives on the next website you visit. This ubiquity makes JavaScript a sought-after skill. This course is designed to teach you that skill from scratch.</p><p>You’ll begin by learning how to set up your coding playground and then gain some familiarity with the JavaScript syntax. Once you’ve gotten your hands dirty, you’ll discover how to store data in variables, comment out your code, and do more with your variables by learning about operators.</p><p>Next, you’ll learn about data structures and conditional statements, further shoring up your JavaScript skills. By learning about the Document Object Model (The DOM), you will be able to change the elements of a webpage and add interactivity to it. You’ll also learn to work with strings and arrays, and then, to make your code concise, learn how to write your own functions. Toward the end of the course, you’ll work on a final project wherein you’ll get to use all these skills together.</p><p>By completing this course, not only will you have a solid understanding of modern JavaScript language, you’ll also be able to use it to create engaging, interactive webpages.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><b>Discover how to take advantage of common cryptographic operations to build safer apps that respect users' privacy with the help of examples in JavaScript for Node.js and browsers</b></p><h4>Key Features</h4><ul><li>Understand how to implement common cryptographic operations in your code with practical examples</li><li>Learn about picking modern safe algorithms, which libraries you should rely on, and how to use them correctly</li><li>Build modern and secure applications that respect your users' privacy with cryptography</li></ul><h4>Book Description</h4><p>If you're a software developer, this book will give you an introduction to cryptography, helping you understand how to make the most of it for your applications. The book contains extensive code samples in JavaScript, both for Node.js and for frontend apps running in a web browser, although the core concepts can be used by developers working with any programming language and framework.</p><p>With a purely hands-on approach that is focused on sharing actionable knowledge, you'll learn about the common categories of cryptographic operations that you can leverage in all apps you're developing, including hashing, encryption with symmetric, asymmetric and hybrid ciphers, and digital signatures. You'll learn when to use these operations and how to choose and implement the most popular algorithms to perform them, including SHA-2, Argon2, AES, ChaCha20-Poly1305, RSA, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography. Later, you'll learn how to deal with password and key management. All code in this book is written in JavaScript and designed to run in Node.js or as part of frontend apps for web browsers.</p><p>By the end of this book, you'll be able to build solutions that leverage cryptography to protect user privacy, offer better security against an expanding and more complex threat landscape, help meet data protection requirements, and unlock new opportunities.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Write JavaScript code that uses cryptography running within a Node.js environment for the server-side or in frontend applications for web browsers</li><li>Use modern, safe hashing functions for calculating digests and key derivation, including SHA-2 and Argon2</li><li>Practice encrypting messages and files with a symmetric key using AES and ChaCha20-Poly1305</li><li>Use asymmetric and hybrid encryption, leveraging RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography with ECDH and ECIES</li><li>Calculate and verify digital signatures using RSA and ECDSA/EdDSA</li><li>Manage passwords and encryption keys safely</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This cryptography book is an introductory guide for software developers who don't necessarily have a background in cryptography but are interested in learning how to integrate it in their solutions, correctly and safely. You'll need to have at least intermediate-level knowledge of building apps with JavaScript and familiarity with Node.js to make the most of this book.</p></span>",

    "title": "Web Development with ReasonML",
    "description": "<span><div><p>ReasonML is a new, type-safe, functional language that compiles to efficient, readable JavaScript. ReasonML interoperates with existing JavaScript libraries and works especially well with React, one of the most popular front-end frameworks. Learn how to take advantage of the power of a functional language while keeping the flexibility of the whole JavaScript ecosystem. Move beyond theory and get things done faster and more reliably with ReasonML today.</p><p>ReasonML is a new syntax for OCaml, a battle-tested programming language used in industry for over 20 years. Designed to be familiar to JavaScript programmers, ReasonML code compiles to highly readable JavaScript.  With ReasonML, you get OCaml's powerful functional programming features: a strong static type system with an excellent type inference engine, pattern matching, and features for functional programming with immutable variables. ReasonML also allows flexibility with opt-in side effects, mutation, and object-oriented programming. ReasonML hits the sweet spot between the pure theoretical world and the laissez-faire approach of JavaScript.</p><p/>Start using ReasonML's powerful type system as you learn the essentials of the language: variables and arithmetic operations. Gain expressive power as you write functions with named parameters and currying. Define your own data types, and integrate all these capabilities into a simple web page. Take advantage of ReasonML's functional data structures with map and reduce functions. Discover new ways to write algorithms with ReasonML's recursion support. Interoperate with existing JavaScript libraries with bindings, and write reactive web applications using ReasonML in tandem with React. Reinforce concepts with examples that range from short, tightly focused functions to complete programs, and practice your new skills with exercises in each chapter.With ReasonML, harness the awesome power of a functional language while retaining the best features of JavaScript to produce concise, fast, type-safe programs.<p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>You'll need to have node.js (version 10.0 or above) and npm (version 5.6 or above). Once you install the bs-platform package and fire up a text editor, you're ready to go. (There are plugins for many popular editors that will make editing easier.)</p></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p><b>Create more robust applications with a test-first approach to JavaScript</b></p><p><em>Reliable JavaScript, How to Code Safely in the World's Most Dangerous Language</em> demonstrates how to create test-driven development for large-scale JavaScript applications that will stand the test of time and stay accurate through long-term use and maintenance. Taking a test-first approach to software architecture, this book walks you through several patterns and practices and explains what they are supposed to do by having you write unit tests. Write the code to pass the unit tests, so you not only develop your technique for structuring large-scale applications, but you also learn how to test your work. You'll come away with hands-on practice that results in code that is correct from the start, and has the test coverage to ensure that it stays correct during subsequent maintenance. All code is provided both in the text and on the web, so you can immediately get started designing more complete, robust applications.</p><p>JavaScript has graduated from field-validation scripts to full-scale applications, but many developers still approach their work as if they were writing simple scripts.

    "description": "<span><span><p/><p>This brief book explains the advantages of the object model, inheritance, both classical and prototypical, and shows how these concepts can be implemented in JavaScript. It also shows how object programming (OP) opens a new world of design possibilities that go far beyond inheritance.</p><p>This book will help the intermediate JavaScript programmer learn to use both types of inheritance. For classical inheritance, it is accompanied by a substantial online system (a windowing UI library) that shows classical inheritance at its best. The same system shows how OP \"capabilities\" can eliminate much of the need for inheritance. </p><p>For experienced JavaScript programmers, this book shows why most of the old views of JavaScript's inheritance have not done it justice. JavaScript classes inherit from JavaScript's prototypes, a fact that makes JavaScript's prototypes, when used correctly, functional equivalents to C++ classes (not to prototypes in true prototypal languages, like Self). </p><p>JavaScript's object programming (not inheritance) is what separates it from classical OOP languages like C++ and Java. Most important, basing inheritance on JavaScript's prototypal chain is possible, but is not the best choice for prototypal inheritance or classical inheritance.</p></span></span>",

    "title": "Async JavaScript",
    "description": "<span><p>With the advent of HTML5, front-end MVC, and Node.js, JavaScript is ubiquitous--and still messy. This book will give you a solid foundation for managing async tasks without losing your sanity in a tangle of callbacks. It's a fast-paced guide to the most essential techniques for dealing with async behavior, including PubSub, evented models, and Promises. With these tricks up your sleeve, you'll be better prepared to manage the complexity of large web apps and deliver responsive code.<br/><br/>With <i>Async JavaScript</i>, you'll develop a deeper understanding of the JavaScript language. You'll start with a ground-up primer on the JavaScript event model--key to avoiding many of the most common mistakes JavaScripters make. From there you'll see tools and design patterns for turning that conceptual understanding into practical code.<br/><br/>The concepts in the book are illustrated with runnable examples drawn from both the browser and the Node.js server framework, incorporating complementary libraries including jQuery, Backbone.js, and Async.js. You'll learn how to create dynamic web pages and highly concurrent servers by mastering the art of distributing events to where they need to be handled, rather than nesting callbacks within callbacks within callbacks.<br/><br/><i>Async JavaScript</i> will get you up and running with real web development quickly. By the time you've finished the Promises chapter, you'll be parallelizing Ajax requests or running animations in sequence. By the end of the book, you'll even know how to leverage Web Workers and AMD for JavaScript applications with cutting-edge performance. Most importantly, you'll have the knowledge you need to write async code with confidence.<br/><br/><b>What You Need:</b><br/><br/>Basic knowledge of JavaScript is recommended. If you feel that you're not up to speed, see the \"Resources for Learning JavaScript\" section in the preface.</p></span>",

You will get acquainted with features of ECMAScript 8 such as async, SharedArrayBuffers, and Atomic operations that enhance asynchronous and parallel operations. In addition to this, this book will introduce you to SharedArrayBuffers, which allow web workers to share data directly, and Atomic operations, which help coordinate behavior across the threads. You will also work with OOP and Collections, followed by new functions and methods on the built-in Object and Array types that make common operations more manageable and less error-prone. You will then see how to easily build more sophisticated and expressive program structures with classes and inheritance. In the end, we will cover Sets, Maps, and Symbols, which are the new types introduced in ECMAScript 6 to add new behaviors and allow you to create simple and powerful modules.</p><p>By the end of the book, you will be able to produce more efficient, expressive, and simpler programs using the new features of ECMAScript.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This book will follow a modular approach covering independent recipes on different features of ECMAScript throughout the book.</p></span>",

If you remove that from JavaScript, then what remains is the international JavaScript programming standard – the lightweight and fast ECMAScript. </p><p>In this video course, we will show you how you can start implementing ECMAScript programming techniques, use the ES 2017 features, and progress towards becoming a skilled web developer with JavaScript. You will be introduced to the latest Async functions, the new object rules and relationships, and how to use them properly in your program.</p><p>You'll learn how building modular applications is much easier with the native module system and how your code can become cleaner, more succinct, and more enjoyable to work with. Moving on, we teach you how to create reflection objects, use them to expose hidden object properties, and test the security of these objects. Next, the videos demonstrate code samples and demos of the corresponding features, and their use cases.</p><p>By the end of the course, you will be familiar with the new features that are available in ES 2017.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><span><p/><p>A big challenge in writing web applications today is the intense\npressure to go for the short term win: you quickly pull something\ntogether that looks good, launch, and move on. But the risk is that\nnow you're locked in — making major changes over the lifetime of\nthe code base requires radical surgery, or sometimes just starting\nover. Is it possible to meet your deadlines and get long term\nmaintenance and reuse?Fortunately, modern JavaScript libraries\noffer some excellent patterns that can help you safely extend &amp;\nreuse components for months and years to come — without\nover-engineering or sacrificing much development speed. The key is\nto build upon a solid foundation that gives you lots of flexibility\ndown the road. In this interactive webcast presented by Evan Goer,\nauthor of YUI 3 Cookbook, we'll walk through some specific examples\nfrom the YUI Library that cleanly separate concerns, and then show\nhow that pays off: first by radically altering a component's\nfunctionality without affecting its core plumbing, and then neatly\npackaging up that change as a plugin, as a \"class-like\" extension,\nand as a mixin.</p></span></span></span></span>",

If you’re\nfamiliar with GoLive, JavaScript, and C and C++ programming,\nyou’ll find the information you need to create custom tools\nand extensions tailored to your specific GoLive tasks.

And since nearly all of the user\ncommands in GoLive are made available in JavaScript, you can use\nJavaScript to automate repetitive tasks--for example, editing all\nthe documents on your Web site automatically, or customizing menu\nitems in GoLive according to the contents of a specific database.\nThese are just a few of the ways that scripting can save you from\nhours of time-consuming tasks in GoLive.</p></span></span>",

Or do you worry that there is not enough: not enough time, not enough money, not enough opportunity, not enough…whatever? Consciously and unconsciously, dozens of times a day, we tell ourselves that we are lacking, that our lives are lacking, that the universe is lacking. We lull ourselves into what Victoria Castle calls the “Trance of Scarcity”—a numbed state in which we're crippled by the pervasive assumption that lack, struggle, and separation are our unavoidable fate. But what if it is the very story we tell ourselves—both as individuals and as a society—that keeps us trapped in this limited state? Here Castle shows you how to embody a new story—one that is about abundance, inspiration, and your own innate ability to create your reality. Once you break free from the Trance of Scarcity, you'll be able to live a more meaningful and fulfilling life.<br/>\n  </span>",

Books\ncurrently out on the shelf are not up to the latest in browser\ntechnology; thus, frustrating readers because everything done in\nJavaScript is dependent on browser capabilities. The web site will\ncontain all the source code used in the book.</p></span></span>",

    "title": "JavaScript Pocket Reference, 2nd Edition",
    "description": "<span><span><p>JavaScript--the powerful, object-based scripting language that can be embedded directly into HTML pages--has earned its place in the web developer's toolkit, to the extent that it's now considered required knowledge for web developers.  You can use JavaScript to create dynamic, interactive applications that run completely within a web browser.  JavaScript is also the language of choice for developing Dynamic HTML content.  Because its syntax is based on the popular programming languages C, C++, and Java, JavaScript is familiar and easy to learn for experienced programmers. At the same time, it's an interpreted scripting language, providing a flexible, forgiving programming environment for new programmers.  <br/><br/>The <i>JavaScript Pocket Reference</i>, 2nd Edition, provides a complete overview of the core JavaScript language and client-side scripting environment, as well as quick-reference material on core and client-side objects, methods, and properties.  The new edition has been revised to cover JavaScript 1.5, and is particularly useful for developers working with the standards-compliant web browsers, such as Internet Explorer 6, Netscape 7, and Mozilla.  Ideal as an introduction for beginners and a quick reference for advanced developers, this pocket-sized book is easy to take anywhere and serves as the perfect companion volume to the bestselling <i>JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</i>, 4th Edition.<br/><br/>O'Reilly's Pocket References have become a favorite among developers everywhere.  By providing a wealth of important details in a concise, well-organized format, these handy books deliver just what you need to complete the task at hand. When you've reached a sticking point and need to get to the answer quickly, the new <i>JavaScript Pocket Reference</i> is the book you'll want close at hand.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>On numerous online forums for JavaScript and DHTML, the majority of questions begin with \"How do I...?\"  This new Cookbook provides the answers.  After reading thousands of forum threads over the years, author and scripting pioneer Danny Goodman has compiled a list of problems that frequently vex scripters of various experience levels.  He has now applied state-of-the-art ECMA and W3C DOM standards and used best practices to create this extensive collection of practical recipes that can bring your web pages to life.The <i>JavaScript &amp; DHTML Cookbook</i> is all about adding value to the content of a web page.  The book focuses on practical and sensible applications of scripting, rather than flying images and gratuitous color changes.  For every problem Goodman addresses, there's a solution or \"recipe\"--a focused piece of code that web developers can insert directly into their applications.  Yet, rather than just cut-and-paste code, you also get explanations of how and why the code works, so you can learn to adapt the problem-solving techniques to your designs.The recipes range from simple tasks, such as manipulating strings and validating dates in JavaScript, to entire libraries that demonstrate complex tasks, such as cross-browser positioning of HTML elements and sorting tables.  This book contains over 150 recipes on the following topics:</p><ul><li>Working with interactive forms and style sheets</li><li>Presenting user-friendly page navigation</li><li>Creating dynamic content</li><li>Producing visual effects for stationary content</li><li>Positioning HTML elements</li><li>Managing browser windows and multiple frames</li></ul>This book is the ideal companion to O'Reilly's <i>JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</i> and <i>Dynamic HTML: The Definitive Reference</i>.  If you own either of these books, the <i>JavaScript &amp; DHTML Cookbook</i> is a must.</div></span></span>",

Simplicity, reactivity, and ?exibility are some of the key benefits that Vue offers to developers. This book will help you learn everything you need to know to build stunning reactive web apps with Vue.js 2 quickly and easily.\n</p><p>This book will take you through the Vue 2 framework. You will start by learning the different Vue installation options: CDN, NPM, and Vue CLI. Then we will look at the core concepts of Vue: templates and components – ways to modularize Vue code. You will learn how to utilize directives, which are Vue-specific HTML attributes with additional features. Also, you will see how Vue uses a streamlined approach to development, with reusable methods, computed properties, and watchers, and how it controls state with the help of its data option.\n</p><p>You will learn about the concepts of reactive programming in Vue, and how to understand communication between parent and child components. We will take a look at props and slots, working with CSS, filters, and mixins. We will also look at ways to add transitions and animations to Vue apps. Then you will extend Vue by building custom directives and your own plugins. \n</p><p>Finally, you will learn about Vuex – a Vue plugin that allows us to centralize state, and also introduce Nuxt, which is a framework that builds on top of Vue and solves some issues of single-page applications. After learning about these components, you will be ready to build your own reactive web apps with Vue.js 2.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Develop apps with Vue.js\n</li><li>Reuse components using slots\n</li><li>Use filters, mixins, and global mixins in Vue\n</li><li>Build custom directives in Vue\n</li><li>Work with CSS animations\n</li><li>Work with templates, directives, methods, data, computed properties, and watchers\n</li><li>Use Nuxt and Vue-Router\n</li><li>Build and deploy an SSR Vue app</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book is for people who want to learn and experience developing with Vue.js.

High performance on a platform like Node.js is knowing how to take advantage of every aspect of your hardware, helping memory management act at its best, and correctly deciding how to architect a complex application. Do not panic if your applications start consuming a lot of memory; instead spot the leak and solve it fast with Node.js by monitoring and stopping it before it becomes an issue.</p><p>This book will provide you with the skills you need to analyze the performance of your application and monitor the aspects that can and should be. Starting with performance analysis concepts and their importance in helping Node.js developers eliminate performance bottlenecks, this book will take you through development patterns to avoid performance penalties. You will learn the importance of garbage collection and its behaviour,and discover how to profile your processor, allowing better performance and scalability.</p><p>You will then learn about the different types of data storage methods. Moving on, you will get to grips with testing and benchmarking applications to avoid unknown application test zones. Lastly, you will explore the limits that external components can impose in your application in the form of bottlenecks.</p><p>By following the examples in each chapter, you will discover tips to getting better performing applications by avoiding anti-patterns and stretching the limits of your environment as much as possible.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Develop applications using well-defined and well-tested development patterns</li><li>Explore memory management and garbage collection to improve performance</li><li>Monitor memory changes and analyze heap snapshots</li><li>Profile the CPU and improve your code to avoid patterns that force intensive processor usage</li><li>Understand the importance of data and when you should cache information.</li><li>Learn to always test your code and benchmark when needed</li><li>Extend your application's scope and know what other elements can influence performance</li></ul><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>This book is for Node.js developers who want a more in-depth knowledge of the platform to improve the performance of their applications. Whether you have a base Node.js background or you are an expert who knows the garbage collector and wants to leverage it to make applications more robust, the examples in this book will benefit you.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This is a practical guide to learning high performance, which even the least experienced developer will comprehend. Small and simple examples help you test concepts yourself and easily adapt them to any application, boosting its performance and preparing it for the real-world.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p/><p><em/><em>Pro Express.js </em>is for the reader who wants to quickly get up-to-speed with Express.js, the flexible Node.js framework. Author Azat Mardan clearly explains how to start developing with Express.js with a basic 'Hello World', and then delves into a deep API reference, before looking at common and abstract development problems. Lastly, you will learn how to build a series of real-world apps in order to cement your knowledge.</p><em/><p>In order to get the best from this book, you will be familiar with Node.js scripts and able to install packages using npm. In the deep API reference, each aspect of the Express.js API is explained clearly with a simple exercise to demonstrate its usage. This includes configuration, settings and environments; different middleware and its uses; templating engines; extracting parameters and routing; request and response; error handling; and running an app. In the next part you'll delve into abstraction, streams, authentication, multithreading, Socket.io, security, and more complex modules. You will also learn about smaller frameworks built using Express.js, such as Sails.js, and Derby. Finally you'll build real-world apps including a REST API, Todo App, and Instagram gallery. </p><p>Express.js is used by a range of well-known companies such as MySpace and Storify, and it's becoming more and more likely that it'll be a required skill for new developers. With this book you can skip learning via complicated documentation, and get the information from a developer who's been using Express.js for long enough to explain things well. Add <em>Pro Express.js</em> to your library today. </p></span></span>",

It allows web designers to access the backend of their projects while also allowing developers, who are willing to learn JavaScript, a chance to design. There are many frameworks that have popped up in recent years, but what makes Node.js unique is that it opens up a whole new frontier for web development and takes a hybrid approach.</p><p>This book will help you get to grips with Node.js and implement the knowledge to build efficient web applications. You start with developing a backend web application followed by a frontend interface, and later on deploy it to the cloud platform. This book takes a holistic approach to server-side programming using Node.js in conjunction with different frameworks and tools.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Build and implement your custom middleware for Express</li><li>Integrate Socket.IO with Express and use the same authentication</li><li>Create a secure local store for passwords</li><li>Use message queues to break down your application into manageable pieces</li><li>Leverage the power of Redis to create a shared state across many different servers</li><li>Implement Backbone, Socket.IO, and React together for a fast, dynamic, and real-time frontend</li><li>Automate your build process with the use of the Grunt.js task runner</li><li>Build deployment scripts to get servers running your application in the cloud</li></ul></span>",

Getting MEAN will take you there.\"</i><br/>\nMatt Merkes, MyNeighbor<br/><br/>\n<p><b>Getting MEAN</b> teaches you how to develop web applications using the MEAN stack. First, you'll create the skeleton of a static site in Express and Node, and then push it up to a live web server. Next, add a MongoDB database and build an API before using Angular to handle data manipulation and application logic in the browser. Finally you'll add an authentication system to the application, using the whole stack. When you finish, you'll have all the skills you need to build a dynamic data-driven web application.<br/>\n</p><p>Traditional web dev stacks use a different programming language in every layer, resulting in a complex mashup of code and frameworks. Together, the MongoDB database, the Express and AngularJS frameworks, and Node.js constitute the MEAN stack - a powerful platform that uses only one language, top to bottom: JavaScript. Developers and businesses love it because it's scalable and cost-effective. End users love it because the apps created with it are fast and responsive. It's a win-win-win!</p>\nInside:\n<ul><li>Full-stack development using JavaScript\n</li><li>Responsive web techniques\n</li><li>Everything you need to get started with MEAN\n</li><li>Best practices for efficiency and reusability\n</li></ul>\nLearners should have some web development experience.

    "description": "<span><p>Used in laptop and desktop computers, low-end servers, and mobile devices, Serial ATA (Advance Technology Attachment), or SATA, is the pervasive disk storage technology in use today. SATA has also penetrated the enterprise computing environment by adding hardware components for fail-over, extending command processing capabilities, and increasing device performance and link speeds. If you work in a data center or manage your company’s storage resources, you will likely encounter storage solutions that require SATA software or hardware.</p><p>In this book, leading storage networking technologist David Deming presents a comprehensive guide to designing, analyzing, and troubleshooting any SATA or SATA Express (SATAe) storage solution. Written by an engineer, this book is for those who aren't afraid of digging into the technical details. It explains how SATA/SATAe powers data center applications and how it influences and interacts with all protocol layers and system components. </p><p>This book covers all of the tasks associated with installing, configuring, and managing SATA/SATAe storage applications. If you are a test engineer, design engineer, system architect, or even a technically skilled gamer who likes to build your own systems, this book will answer your technical questions about SATA/SATAe. With this book, you should have everything you need to implement a SATA or SATAe storage solution.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p>Application Express, or APEX, is one of the most innovative products to come out of Oracle in years. APEX is an application development framework for developing database–backed applications. It's easy enough to get started in that power users can quit storing data in random spreadsheets and instead centralize their data in the powerful Oracle database, all without developer help. Developers aren't left out, however. Those who choose to do so can go deep and leverage the full power and flexibility of Oracle's database engine.</p><p>Getting started with APEX is easy; learning how to take full advantage of APEX is the problem. It was the problem, that is, until this book came along. In <em>Pro Oracle Application Express</em>, authors <b>John Scott</b> and <b>Scott Spendolini</b> open the \"hood\" of APEX and expose the full power behind its easy–to–use GUI. They show you what you need to know to produce powerful, professionally polished applications—such as user-authentication models, approaches to layout and navigation, how to integrate Ajax, how to deal with localization issues such as time zones and translations, how to customize the look and feel of an APEX web site, and much, much more.</p><p>The authors are well–qualified to write on APEX. John Scott runs ShellPrompt, a hosting service that handles many large-scale APEX applications, some of which he is paid to develop. John is a hard–core APEX developer. His co-author, Scott Spendolini, is one of the original creators of APEX. Both John and Scott now base their full-time careers on developing APEX applications. <em>Pro Oracle Application Express</em> is your opportunity to learn APEX from the very best.</p></span></span></span>",

These components, which are not actually part\nof the business solution, but are required to support the\napplication program, are called middleware.</p><p>The process of obtaining, installing, configuring, and\nsupporting the middleware components is a complex process for the\nsolution provider, who currently has to absorb the cost of setting\nup the environment. The provider has to work with multiple\nsuppliers who have multiple terms and conditions, different license\nstructures, and multiple departments to work with on the contracts\nand support structures, all of which leads to added infrastructure\ncosts and inefficiency.</p><p>IBM designed the Express Runtime offering to address the needs\nof the solution providers serving mid-market customers. The main\ndesign criteria were reducing complexity for the providers by\noffering a pre-integrated and pre-configured middleware solution\nwith a single contract, one license, one set of contracts, and a\nvery competitive price.</p><p>With Express Runtime, you get WebSphere Application Server -\nExpress, DB2 UDB Express, and IBM HTTP Server with a single\ninstall, one contract, and a significantly lower cost compared to\npurchasing the individual components. Express Runtime includes\nquick start samples and documentation to get you up and running\nquickly and easily.</p><p>Please note that the additional material referenced in the text is not available from IBM.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span>\n    \"We had no vehicle. We didn't know how or if we could continue heading south. I was in a vast, seemingly endless desert. I didn't know when or if we'd make it to the other side. I didn't even know where the other side was. It wasn't in Algeria. I knew that much. Was it in Niger? Where does the Sahara actually end?\"<br/>We live in a culture, Donahue writes, which loves \"climbing mountains.\" We want to see the peak, map out a route, and follow it to the top. Sometimes this approach works, but not always, particularly when we are enduring a personal crisis-divorce, job loss, addiction, illness, or death. We may not know exactly where we are going, how to get there, or even how we'll know we've arrived.<br/>And it's not just in times of crisis. There are many deserts in our lives, situations with no clear paths or boundaries. Finding a job is usually a mountain, but changing careers can be a desert. Having a baby is a mountain, especially for the mom. But raising a child is a desert. Battling cancer is a mountain. Living with a chronic illness is a desert.<br/>In the desert, we need to follow different rules than we follow when conquering a mountain. We need to be more intuitive, more patient, more spontaneous. Donahue outlines six \"rules of desert travel\" that will help us discover our direction by wandering, find our own personal oases, and cross our self-imposed borders.<br/>\"The sun appears like a silent explosion, a slow motion fireworks display dazzling the volcanic crags of the Hoggar. I stand up and walk to the path and begin descending to Klaus' car. I've made my decision. Tallis and I will travel, somehow, to Agadez. I don't have a logical explanation for my decision or a plan to get to the last oasis. I know I am on the right journey-I am following my compass.\"<br/>Shifting Sands shows us how to slow down, reflect, and embrace the changes of life graciously, naturally, and courageously.\n  </span>",

This is a great option for developers as they're more familiar with code, rather than using special tools for generating diagrams. Besides, diagrams in code simplify maintenance and ensure that the code is supported by version control systems. In some cases, Mermaid makes refactoring support for name changes possible while also enabling team collaboration for review distribution and updates.</p><p>Developers working with any system will be able to put their knowledge to work with this practical guide to using Mermaid for documentation. The book is also a great reference for looking up the syntax for specific diagrams when authoring diagrams.</p><p>You'll start by learning the importance of accurate and visual documentation. Next, the book introduces Mermaid and establishes how to use it to create effective documentation. By using different tools, editors, or a custom documentation platform, you'll also understand how to use Mermaid syntax for various diagrams. Later chapters cover advanced configuration settings and theme options to manipulate your diagram as per your needs.</p><p>By the end of this book, you'll be well-versed with Mermaid diagrams and how they can be used in your workflows.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Understand good and bad documentation, and the art of effective documentation</li><li>Become well-versed with maintaining complex diagrams with ease</li><li>Discover how to draw different types of Mermaid diagrams such as flowcharts, class diagrams, Gantt charts, and more</li><li>Implement Mermaid diagrams in your workflows</li><li>Understand how to set up themes for a Mermaid diagram or an entire site</li><li>Get to grips with setting up a custom documentation system</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book is for content generators such as technical writers, developers, architects, business analysts, and managers who want to learn effective documentation or how to effectively represent diagrams using simple text code snippets and extract them. Familiarity with documentation using Markdown will be helpful, but not necessary.</p></span>",
