    "description": "<span><div><p>Capturing a wealth of experience about the design of object-oriented software, four top-notch designers present a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to commonly occurring design problems. Previously undocumented, these 23 patterns allow designers to create more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable designs without having to rediscover the design solutions themselves.</p><p>The authors begin by describing what patterns are and how they can help you design object-oriented software. They then go on to systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. With Design Patterns as your guide, you will learn how these important patterns fit into the software development process, and how you can leverage them to solve your own design problems most efficiently.</p><p>Each pattern describes the circumstances in which it is applicable, when it can be applied in view of other design constraints, and the consequences and trade-offs of using the pattern within a larger design. All patterns are compiled from real systems and are based on real-world examples. Each pattern also includes code that demonstrates how it may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages like C++ or Smalltalk.</p></div></span>",

Eric thinks that learning about your problem domain is as\nlikely to happen at the end of your project as at the beginning,\nand so refactoring is a big part of his technique.</p><p>“The book is a fun read. Eric has lots\nof interesting stories, and he has a way with words. I see this\nbook as essential reading for software developers—it is a\nfuture classic.”</p><p>—<b>Ralph Johnson</b>, author of\n<em>Design Patterns</em></p><p>“If you don’t think you are\ngetting value from your investment in object-oriented programming,\nthis book will tell you what you’ve forgotten to do.</p><p>“Eric Evans convincingly argues for\nthe importance of domain modeling as the central focus of\ndevelopment and provides a solid framework and set of techniques\nfor accomplishing it. This is timeless wisdom, and will hold up\nlong after the methodologies du jour have gone out of\nfashion.”</p><p>—<b>Dave Collins</b>, author of\n<em>Designing Object-Oriented User Interfaces</em></p><p>“Eric weaves real-world experience\nmodeling—and building—business applications into a\npractical, useful book. Written from the perspective of a trusted\npractitioner, Eric’s descriptions of ubiquitous language, the\nbenefits of sharing models with users, object life-cycle\nmanagement, logical and physical application structuring, and the\nprocess and results of deep refactoring are major contributions to\nour field.”</p><p>—<b>Luke Hohmann</b>, author of\n<em>Beyond Software Architecture</em></p><p>“This book belongs on the shelf of\nevery thoughtful software developer.”</p><p>—<b>Kent Beck</b></p><p>“What Eric has managed to capture is a\npart of the design process that experienced object designers have\nalways used, but that we have been singularly unsuccessful as a\ngroup in conveying to the rest of the industry. We've given away\nbits and pieces of this knowledge...but we've never organized and\nsystematized the principles of building domain logic. This book is\nimportant.”</p><p>—<b>Kyle Brown</b>, author of\n<em>Enterprise Java™ Programming with IBM<sup>®</sup>\nWebSphere<sup>®</sup></em></p><p>The software development community widely\nacknowledges that domain modeling is central to software design.\nThrough domain models, software developers are able to express rich\nfunctionality and translate it into a software implementation that\ntruly serves the needs of its users. But despite its obvious\nimportance, there are few practical resources that explain how to\nincorporate effective domain modeling into the software development\nprocess.</p><p><b><em>Domain-Driven Design</em></b> fills\nthat need. This is not a book about specific technologies. It\noffers readers a systematic approach to domain-driven design,\npresenting an extensive set of design best practices,\nexperience-based techniques, and fundamental principles that\nfacilitate the development of software projects facing complex\ndomains. Intertwining design and development practice, this book\nincorporates numerous examples based on actual projects to\nillustrate the application of domain-driven design to real-world\nsoftware development.</p><p>Readers learn how to use a domain model to\nmake a complex development effort more focused and dynamic. A core\nof best practices and standard patterns provides a common language\nfor the development team. A shift in emphasis—refactoring not\njust the code but the model underlying the code—in\ncombination with the frequent iterations of Agile development leads\nto deeper insight into domains and enhanced communication between\ndomain expert and programmer. <b><em>Domain-Driven Design</em></b>\nthen builds on this foundation, and addresses modeling and design\nfor complex systems and larger organizations.Specific topics\ncovered include:</p><li><p>Getting all team members to speak the same language</p></li><li><p>Connecting model and implementation more deeply</p></li><li><p>Sharpening key distinctions in a model</p></li><li><p>Managing the lifecycle of a domain object</p></li><li><p>Writing domain code that is safe to combine in elaborate\nways</p></li><li><p>Making complex code obvious and predictable</p></li><li><p>Formulating a domain vision statement</p></li><li><p>Distilling the core of a complex domain</p></li><li><p>Digging out implicit concepts needed in the model</p></li><li><p>Applying analysis patterns</p></li><li><p>Relating design patterns to the model</p></li><li><p>Maintaining model integrity in a large system</p></li><li><p>Dealing with coexisting models on the same project</p></li><li><p>Organizing systems with large-scale structures</p></li><li><p>Recognizing and responding to modeling breakthroughs</p></li><p>With this book in hand, object-oriented\ndevelopers, system analysts, and designers will have the guidance\nthey need to organize and focus their work, create rich and useful\ndomain models, and leverage those models into quality, long-lasting\nsoftware implementations.</p></span></span>",

He consults and teaches around Domain-Driven Design and reactive software development, helping teams and organizations realize the potential of business-driven and reactive systems as they transition from technology-driven legacy web implementation approaches. As he does so, he puts strong emphasis on embracing simplicity whenever possible. Vaughn has taught his 3-day Implementing Domain-Driven Design Workshop around the globe to hundreds of software developers. Some of his early exposure to domain modeling, the foundation of domain-driven design, came since 1991 with the use of the Smalltalk programming language. He has continually practiced the tenets of domain modeling since then, and was naturally drawn to Eric Evans’ work on DDD. He is an experienced speaker, having presented at many conferences. He is the founder and principal consultant and trainer at for {comprehension}, a Colorado-based business solutions provider. Vaughn is the author of <em>Implementing Domain Driven Design</em> (Addison-Wesley, 2013), <em>Domain Driven Design Distilled</em> (Addison-Wesley, 2016) and <em>Reactive Messaging Patterns with the Actor Model: Applications and Integration in Scala and Akka</em> (Addison-Wesley, 2015).</p><p><strong>Skill Level</strong></p><ul><li>Intermediate</li></ul><p><strong>What You Will Learn</strong></p><ul><li>What DDD can do for you and your organization‚Äîand why it’s so important</li><li>The cornerstones of strategic design with DDD: Bounded Contexts and Ubiquitous Language</li><li>Strategic design with Subdomains</li><li>Context Mapping: helping teams work together and integrate software more strategically</li><li>Tactical design with Aggregates and Domain Events</li><li>Using project acceleration and management tools to establish and maintain team cadence</li></ul><p><strong>Who Should Take This Course</strong></p><ul><li>Domain-Driven Design Distilled LiveLessons brings DDD to life.

Each principle is backed up\nby realistic Java examples–all applicable to C#\ndevelopers–and all content is tied together by a single case\nstudy: the delivery of a large-scale Scrum-based SaaS system for a\nmultitenant environment.</p><p>The author takes you far beyond\n“DDD-lite” approaches that embrace DDD solely as a\ntechnical toolset, and shows you how to fully leverage DDD’s\n“strategic design patterns” using Bounded Context,\nContext Maps, and the Ubiquitous Language. Using these techniques\nand examples, you can reduce time to market and improve quality, as\nyou build software that is more flexible, more scalable, and more\ntightly aligned to business goals.</p><p>Coverage includes</p><li><p>Getting started the right way with DDD, so you can rapidly gain\nvalue from it</p></li><li><p>Using DDD within diverse architectures, including Hexagonal,\nSOA, REST, CQRS, Event-Driven, and Fabric/Grid-Based</p></li><li><p>Appropriately designing and applying Entities–and\nlearning when to use Value Objects instead</p></li><li><p>Mastering DDD’s powerful new Domain Events technique</p></li><li><p>Designing Repositories for ORM, NoSQL, and other databases</p></li></span></span>",

Many Python developers are taking an interest in high-level software design patterns such as hexagonal/clean architecture, event-driven architecture, and the strategic patterns prescribed by domain-driven design (DDD). But translating those patterns into Python isn’t always straightforward.<br/><br/>With this hands-on guide, Harry Percival and Bob Gregory from MADE.com introduce proven architectural design patterns to help Python developers manage application complexity—and get the most value out of their test suites. <br/><br/>Each pattern is illustrated with concrete examples in beautiful, idiomatic Python, avoiding some of the verbosity of Java and C# syntax. Patterns include:</p><ul><li>Dependency inversion and its links to ports and adapters (hexagonal/clean architecture)</li><li>Domain-driven design’s distinction between Entities, Value Objects, and Aggregates </li><li>Repository and Unit of Work patterns for persistent storage</li><li>Events, commands, and the message bus</li><li>Command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS)</li><li>Event-driven architecture and reactive microservices</li></ul></div></span>",

Vaughn Vernon, author of the best-selling <i>Implementing Domain-Driven Design,</i> draws on his twenty years of experience applying DDD principles to real-world situations. He is uniquely well-qualified to demystify its complexities, illuminate its subtleties, and help you solve the problems you might encounter.</p><p>Vernon guides you through each core DDD technique for building better software. You’ll learn how to segregate domain models using the powerful Bounded Contexts pattern, to develop a Ubiquitous Language within an explicitly bounded context, and to help domain experts and developers work together to create that language. Vernon shows how to use Subdomains to handle legacy systems and to integrate multiple Bounded Contexts to define both team relationships and technical mechanisms.</p><p><b><i>Domain-Driven Design Distilled</i></b> brings DDD to life. Whether you’re a developer, architect, analyst, consultant, or customer, Vernon helps you truly understand it so you can benefit from its remarkable power.</p><p>Coverage includes</p><ul><li>What DDD can do for you and your organization–and why it’s so important</li><li>The cornerstones of strategic design with DDD: Bounded Contexts and Ubiquitous Language</li><li>Strategic design with Subdomains</li><li>Context Mapping: helping teams work together and integrate software more strategically</li><li>Tactical design with Aggregates and Domain Events</li><li>Using project acceleration and management tools to establish and maintain team cadence</li></ul></span>",

    "title": "Design Patterns Explained: A New Perspective on Object-Oriented Design, Second Edition",
    "description": "<span><p>\"One of the great things about the book is\nthe way the authors explain concepts very simply using analogies\nrather than programming examples–this has been very inspiring\nfor a product I'm working on: an audio-only introduction to OOP and\nsoftware development.\"</p><p>–Bruce Eckel</p><p>\"...I would expect that readers with a basic\nunderstanding of object-oriented programming and design would find\nthis book useful, before approaching design patterns completely.\n<em>Design Patterns Explained</em> complements the existing design\npatterns texts and may perform a very useful role, fitting between\nintroductory texts such as UML Distilled and the more advanced\npatterns books.\"</p><p>–James Noble</p><p>Leverage the quality and productivity\nbenefits of patterns–without the complexity! <em>Design\nPatterns Explained, Second Edition</em> is the field's simplest,\nclearest, most practical introduction to patterns. Using dozens of\nupdated Java examples, it shows programmers and architects exactly\nhow to use patterns to design, develop, and deliver software far\nmore effectively.</p><p>You'll start with a complete overview of the\nfundamental principles of patterns, and the role of object-oriented\nanalysis and design in contemporary software development. Then,\nusing easy-to-understand sample code, Alan Shalloway and James\nTrott illuminate dozens of today's most useful patterns: their\nunderlying concepts, advantages, tradeoffs, implementation\ntechniques, and pitfalls to avoid. Many patterns are accompanied by\nUML diagrams.</p><p>Building on their best-selling First\nEdition, Shalloway and Trott have thoroughly updated this book to\nreflect new software design trends, patterns, and implementation\ntechniques. Reflecting extensive reader feedback, they have\ndeepened and clarified coverage throughout, and reorganized content\nfor even greater ease of understanding. New and revamped coverage\nin this edition includes</p><li><p>Better ways to start \"thinking in patterns\"</p></li><li><p>How design patterns can facilitate agile development using\neXtreme Programming and other methods</p></li><li><p>How to use commonality and variability analysis to design\napplication architectures</p></li><li><p>The key role of testing into a patterns-driven development\nprocess</p></li><li><p>How to use factories to instantiate and manage objects more\neffectively</p></li><li><p>The Object-Pool Pattern–a new pattern not identified by\nthe \"Gang of Four\"</p></li><li><p>New study/practice questions at the end of every chapter</p></li><p>Gentle yet thorough, this book assumes no\npatterns experience whatsoever. It's the ideal \"first book\" on\npatterns, and a perfect complement to Gamma's classic <em>Design\nPatterns</em>. If you're a programmer or architect who wants the\nclearest possible understanding of design patterns–or if\nyou've struggled to make them work for you–read this\nbook.</p></span>",

Design patterns allow developers to efficiently address common problems faced during developing applications.</p><p>Go Design Patterns will provide readers with a reference point to software design patterns and CSP concurrency design patterns to help them build applications in a more idiomatic, robust, and convenient way in Go.</p><p>The book starts with a brief introduction to Go programming essentials and quickly moves on to explain the idea behind the creation of design patterns and how they appeared in the 90's as a common \"language\" between developers to solve common tasks in object-oriented programming languages. You will then learn how to apply the 23 Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns in Go and also learn about CSP concurrency patterns, the \"killer feature\" in Go that has helped Google develop software to maintain thousands of servers.</p><p>With all of this the book will enable you to understand and apply design patterns in an idiomatic way that will produce concise, readable, and maintainable software.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This book will teach widely used design patterns and best practices with Go in a step-by-step manner. The code will have detailed examples, to allow programmers to apply design patterns in their day-to-day coding.</p></span>",

The solution facilitates the development of highly cohesive modules</li><li>Use design patterns to provide a structure by which problems can be solved</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Design Patterns give a software developer an array of tried and tested solutions to common problems, thus reducing the technical risk to the project by not having to employ a new and untested design. This course is a practical guide to learning design pattern with 100% coding involved. We encourage users to do coding in parallel while learning the course.</p><p>In this course, you will start by exploring the benefits of using design patterns for developers in their regular development environment. You will move on to see which design patterns are suited for which circumstances. You will see the different categories to which the Design Patterns belong. Throughout this course, each type of Design Pattern will be accompanied by a practical example and information on when to use a given Design Pattern. You will also be shown scenarios in which specific Design Patterns are to be avoided.</p><p>In the end, you will learn how to overcome any issues that may be encountered while using design patterns initially.</p><p><b>Audience</b></p><p>This course is for those programmers/developers who have a basic knowledge of OOPs (preferably in Java) and are looking to refine their code through design patterns in their day to day coding practice.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Praise for <b><em>Design Patterns in Ruby</em></b></p><p>\"<b><em>Design Patterns in Ruby</em></b> documents smart ways to\nresolve many problems that Ruby developers commonly encounter. Russ\nOlsen has done a great job of selecting classic patterns and\naugmenting these with newer patterns that have special relevance\nfor Ruby. He clearly explains each idea, making a wealth of\nexperience available to Ruby developers for their own daily\nwork.\"</p><p>—Steve Metsker, Managing Consultant with Dominion Digital,\nInc.</p><p>\"This book provides a great demonstration of the key 'Gang of\nFour' design patterns without resorting to overly technical\nexplanations. Written in a precise, yet almost informal style, this\nbook covers enough ground that even those without prior exposure to\ndesign patterns will soon feel confident applying them using Ruby.\nOlsen has done a great job to make a book about a classically 'dry'\nsubject into such an engaging and even occasionally humorous\nread.\"</p><p>—Peter Cooper</p><p>\"This book renewed my interest in understanding patterns after a\ndecade of good intentions. Russ picked the most useful patterns for\nRuby and introduced them in a straightforward and logical manner,\ngoing beyond the GoF's patterns. This book has improved my use of\nRuby, and encouraged me to blow off the dust covering the GoF\nbook.\"</p><p>—Mike Stok</p><p>\"<em><b>Design Patterns in Ruby</b></em> is a great way for\nprogrammers from statically typed objectoriented languages to learn\nhow design patterns appear in a more dynamic, flexible language\nlike Ruby.\"</p><p>—Rob Sanheim, Ruby Ninja, Relevance</p><p>Most design pattern books are based on C++ and Java. But Ruby is\ndifferent—and the language's unique qualities make design\npatterns easier to implement and use. In this book, Russ Olsen\ndemonstrates how to combine Ruby's power and elegance with\npatterns, and write more sophisticated, effective software with far\nfewer lines of code.</p><p>After reviewing the history, concepts, and goals of design\npatterns, Olsen offers a quick tour of the Ruby\nlanguage—enough to allow any experienced software developer\nto immediately utilize patterns with Ruby. The book especially\ncalls attention to Ruby features that simplify the use of patterns,\nincluding dynamic typing, code closures, and \"mixins\" for easier\ncode reuse.</p><p>Fourteen of the classic \"Gang of Four\" patterns are considered\nfrom the Ruby point of view, explaining what problems each pattern\nsolves, discussing whether traditional implementations make sense\nin the Ruby environment, and introducing Ruby-specific\nimprovements. You'll discover opportunities to implement patterns\nin just one or two lines of code, instead of the endlessly repeated\nboilerplate that conventional languages often require.</p><p><b><em>Design Patterns in Ruby</em></b> also identifies innovative\nnew patterns that have emerged from the Ruby community. These\ninclude ways to create custom objects with metaprogramming, as well\nas the ambitious Rails-based \"Convention Over Configuration\"\npattern, designed to help integrate entire applications and\nframeworks.</p><p>Engaging, practical, and accessible, <em><b>Design Patterns in\nRuby</b></em> will help you build better software while making your\nRuby programming experience more rewarding.</p></span>",

They speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. This course starts at the nuts-and-bolts level and shows you everything through to advanced patterns and features, going in-depth to give you the knowledge you need.</p><p>You will begin this course with an introduction to SOLID principles, which will introduce you to clean-code concepts and will elevate your skills. With this knowledge in your toolbox, you will be ready to move on to studying creational design patterns, patterns related to the creation of objects, such as Singleton, Factory, and Dependency Injection. You will then acquire more in-depth knowledge of one specific creational pattern, the Dependency Inversion pattern, which will teach you how to write highly extensible, maintainable, and testable code. Moving on, you will get your hands dirty with structural design patterns and you will complete this course by learning the last group of patterns: behavioral design patterns.</p><p>By the end of this course you will be very confident in implementing a new feature in C# and .NET Core because, every time you have a problem, the correct design pattern will spontaneously come to mind.</p><p>This course uses .NET Core 2.0, and VS2017 community edition+, while not the latest version available, it provides relevant and informative content for legacy users of .NET Core, and Visual Studio.</p><p><b>Audience</b></p><p>This course is for C#, .Net professionals and students alike who would like to gain profound insights into design patterns via code walkthroughs and fast-paced knowledge acquisition through listening and watching.</p><p>This course is also suitable for Java developers as C# and Java are very much alike, and the course focuses more on core principles and patterns rather than language specifics. In this case, a quick review of C# features is recommended before starting the course.</p></span>",

Kent Beck distilled his\nexperience into a cohesive collection of implementation patterns.\nThese nuggets of advice will make your code truly worth\nreading.”</p><p>–<em>Gregor Hohpe, author of</em>\nEnterprise Integration Patterns</p><p>“In this book Kent Beck shows how\nwriting clear and readable code follows from the application of\nsimple principles. <em>Implementation Patterns</em> will help\ndevelopers write intention revealing code that is both easy to\nunderstand and flexible towards future extensions. A must read for\ndevelopers who are serious about their code.”</p><p>–<em>Sven Gorts</em></p><p>“<em>Implementation Patterns</em>\nbridges the gap between design and coding. Beck introduces a new\nway of thinking about programming by basing his discussion on\nvalues and principles.”</p><p>–<em>Diomidis Spinellis, author of</em>\nCode Reading <em>and</em> Code Quality</p><p><b>Software Expert Kent Beck Presents a\nCatalog of Patterns Infinitely Useful for Everyday\nProgramming</b></p><p>Great code doesn’t just function: it\nclearly and consistently communicates your intentions, allowing\nother programmers to understand your code, rely on it, and modify\nit with confidence. But great code doesn’t just happen. It is\nthe outcome of hundreds of small but critical decisions programmers\nmake every single day. Now, legendary software innovator Kent\nBeck–known worldwide for creating Extreme Programming and\npioneering software patterns and test-driven\ndevelopment–focuses on these critical decisions, unearthing\npowerful “implementation patterns” for writing programs\nthat are simpler, clearer, better organized, and more cost\neffective.</p><p>Beck collects 77 patterns for handling\neveryday programming tasks and writing more readable code. This new\ncollection of patterns addresses many aspects of development,\nincluding class, state, behavior, method, collections, frameworks,\nand more. He uses diagrams, stories, examples, and essays to engage\nthe reader as he illuminates the patterns. You’ll find proven\nsolutions for handling everything from naming variables to checking\nexceptions.</p><p>This book covers</p><li><p>The value of communicating through code and the philosophy\nbehind patterns</p></li><li><p>How and when to create classes, and how classes encode\nlogic</p></li><li><p>Best practices for storing and retrieving state</p></li><li><p>Behavior: patterns for representing logic, including\nalternative paths</p></li><li><p>Writing, naming, and decomposing methods</p></li><li><p>Choosing and using collections</p></li><li><p>Implementation pattern variations for use in building\nframeworks</p></li><p><b><em>Implementation Patterns</em></b> will\nhelp programmers at all experience levels, especially those who\nhave benefited from software patterns or agile methods. It will\nalso be an indispensable resource for development teams seeking to\nwork together more efficiently and build more maintainable\nsoftware. No other programming book will touch your day-to-day work\nmore often.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>Recent discussions about service mesh have been dominated by vendors, each trying to frame service mesh as a new technology that provides security, reliability, and observability for east-west traffic. However, just as microservices are an architectural pattern and not a specific technology, service mesh is a new way to deploy features that in the past fell into the category of API management.</p><p>In a service mesh, a proxy is deployed locally with each service in an application. Each service only communicates directly with the proxy on its host, and proxies communicate with each other to pass traffic between services over the network.</p><p>Marco Palladino (Kong) explores the service mesh pattern and discusses the problems the pattern is designed to solve, including security (proxies can encrypt all network traffic without services being aware of it), observability (proxies collect metrics, logs, and tracing data from network traffic), reliability (proxies can enforce rate limiting, retries, and handle network drops), composability (swap or reuse services with nothing but a proxy configuration change), standardization (east-west traffic can all be secured in the same way), and efficient development (service developers can focus on business logic instead of interservice communication). Finally, he explains the requirements for any technology that supports this pattern: services can be any size, in any language, or run on any infrastructure or a mix; proxies need to be lightweight, since an instance will be deployed with each service; proxies should be flexible and composable to provide security, reliability, and observability benefits; proxies should be simple to deploy and replace in containerized environments; and proxies should be self-reliant and resilient to network slowdowns and failures.</p><p>This session was recorded at the 2019 O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference in San Jose.</p></div></span></span>",

Microsoft is honored to contribute to the <em>SOA Design Patterns</em> book, and to continue working with the community to realize the value of Real World SOA.”</p><p><em>- Steven Martin, Senior Director, Developer Platform Product Management, Microsoft</em></p><p>“<em>SOA Design Patterns</em> provides the proper guidance with the right level of abstraction to be adapted to each organization’s needs, and Oracle is pleased to have contributed to the patterns contained in this book.”</p><p><em>- Dr. Mohamad Afshar, Director of Product Management, Oracle Fusion Middleware, Oracle</em></p><p>“Red Hat is pleased to be involved in the <em>SOA Design Patterns</em> book and contribute important SOA design patterns to the community that we and our customers have used within our own SOA platforms. I am sure this will be a great resource for future SOA practitioners.”</p><p><em>- Pierre Fricke Director, Product Line Management, JBoss SOA Platform, Red Hat</em></p><p>“A wealth of proven, reusable SOA design patterns, clearly explained and illustrated with examples. An invaluable resource for all those involved in the design of service-oriented solutions.”</p><p><em>- Phil Thomas, Consulting IT Specialist, IBM Software Group</em></p><p>“This obligatory almanac of SOA design patterns will become the foundation on which many organizations will build their successful SOA solutions. It will allow organizations to build their own focused SOA design patterns catalog in an expedited fashion knowing that it contains the wealth and expertise of proven SOA best practices.”</p><p><em>- Stephen Bennett, Director, Technology Business Unit, Oracle Corporation</em></p><p>“The technical differences between service orientation and object orientation are subtle</p><p>enough to confuse even the most advanced developers. Thomas Erl’s book provides a great service by clearly articulating SOA design patterns and differentiating them from similar OO design patterns.”</p><p><em>- Anne Thomas Manes, VP &amp; Research Director, Burton Group</em></p><p>“<em>SOA Design Patterns</em> does an excellent job of laying out and discussing the areas of SOA design that a competent SOA practitioner should understand and employ.”</p><p><em>- Robert Laird, SOA Architect, IBM</em></p><p>“As always, Thomas delivers again. In a well-structured and easy-to-understand way, this book provides a wonderful collection of patterns each addressing a typical set of SOA design problems with well articulated solutions. The plain language and hundreds of diagrams included in the book help make the complicated subjects of SOA design comprehensible even to those who are new to the SOA design world. It’s a must-have reference book for all SOA practitioners, especially for enterprise architects, solution architects, developers, managers, and business process experts.”</p><p><em>- Canyang Kevin Liu, Solution Architecture Manager, SAP</em></p><p>“The concept of service oriented architecture has long promised visions of agile organizations being able to swap out interfaces and applications as business needs change. SOA also promises incredible developer and IT productivity, with the idea that key services would be candidates for cross-enterprise sharing or reuse. But many organizations’ efforts to move to SOA have been mired–by organizational issues, by conflicting vendor messages, and by architectures that may amount to little more than Just a Bunch of Web Services. There’s been a lot of confusion in the SOA marketplace about exactly what SOA is, what it’s supposed to accomplish, and how an enterprise goes about in making it work.</p><p><em>SOA Design Patterns</em> is a definitive work that offers clarity on the purpose and functioning of service oriented architecture. SOA Design Patterns not only helps the IT practitioner lay the groundwork for a well-functioning SOA effort across the enterprise, but also connects the dots between SOA and the business requirements in a very concrete way. Plus, this book is completely technology agnostic—<em>SOA Design Patterns</em> rightly focuses on infrastructure and architecture, and it doesn’t matter whether you’re using components of one kind or another, or Java, or .NET, or Web services, or REST-style interfaces.</p><p>While no two SOA implementations are alike, Thomas Erl and his team of contributors have effectively identified the similarities in composition services need to have at a sub-atomic level in order to interact with each other as we hope they will. The book identifies 85 SOA design patterns which have been developed and thoroughly vetted to ensure that a service-oriented architecture does achieve the flexibility and loose coupling promised. The book is also compelling in that it is a living document, if you will, inviting participation in an open process to identify and formulate new patterns to this growing body of knowledge.”</p><p><em>- Joe McKendrick, Independent Analyst, Author of ZDNet’s SOA Blog</em></p><p>“If you want to truly educate yourself on SOA, read this book.”</p><p><em>- Sona Srinivasan, Global Client Services &amp; Operations, CISCO</em></p><p>“An impressive decomposition of the process and architectural elements that support serviceoriented analysis, design, and delivery. Right-sized and terminologically consistent.</p><p>Overall, the book represents a patient separation of concerns in respect of the process and architectural parts that underpin any serious SOA undertaking. Two things stand out. First, the pattern relationship diagrams provide rich views into the systemic relationships that structure a service-oriented architecture: these patterns are not discrete, isolated templates to be applied mechanically to the problem space; rather, they form a network of forces and constraints that guide the practitioner to consider the task at hand in the context of its inter-dependencies. Second, the pattern sequence diagrams and accompanying notes provide a useful framework for planning and executing the many activities that comprise an SOA engagement.”</p><p><em>- Ian Robinson, Principal Technology Consultant, ThoughtWorks</em></p><p>“Successful implementation of SOA principles requires a shift in focus from software system means, or the way capabilities are developed, to the desired end results, or real-world effects required to satisfy organizational business processes. In <em>SOA Design Patterns</em>, Thomas Erl provides service architects with a broad palette of reusable service patterns that describe service capabilities that can cut across many SOA applications. Service architects taking advantage of these patterns will save a great deal of time describing and assembling services to deliver the real world effects they need to meet their organization’s specific business objectives.”</p><p><em>- Chuck Georgo, Public Safety and National Security Architect</em></p><p>“In IT, we have increasingly come to see the value of having catalogs of good solution patterns in programming and systems design. With this book, Thomas Erl brings a comprehensive set of patterns to bear on the world of SOA. These patterns enable easily communicated, reusable, and effective solutions, allowing us to more rapidly design and build out the large, complicated and interoperable enterprise SOAs into which our IT environments are evolving.”</p><p><em>- Al Gough, Business Systems Solutions CTO, CACI International Inc.</em></p><p>“This book provides a comprehensive and pragmatic review of design issues in service-centric design, development, and evolution. The Web site related to this book [SOAPatterns.org] is a wonderful platform and gives the opportunity for the software community to maintain this catalogue….”</p><p><em>- Veronica Gacitua Decar, Dublin City University</em></p><p>“Erl’s <em>SOA Design Patterns</em> is for the IT decision maker determined to make smart architecture design choices, smart investments, and long term enterprise impact. For those IT professionals committed to service-orientation as a value-added design and implementation option, Patterns offers a credible, repeatable approach to engineering an adaptable business enterprise. This is a must read for all IT architect professionals.”</p><p><em>- Larry Gloss, VP and General Manager, Information Manufacturing, LLC</em></p><p>“These SOA patterns define, encompass, and comprise a complete repertoire of best practices for developing a world-class IT SOA portfolio for the enterprise and its organizational units through to service and schema analysis and design. After many years as an architect on many SOA projects, I strongly recommend this book be on the shelf of every analyst and technical member of any SOA effort, right next to the SOA standards and guidelines it outlines and elucidates the need for. Our SOA governance standards draw heavily from this work and others from this series.”</p><p><em>- Robert John Hathaway III, Enterprise Software Architect, SOA Object Systems</em></p><p>“A wise man once told me that wisdom isn’t all about knowledge and intelligence, it is just as much about asking questions. Asking questions is the true mark of wisdom and during the writing of the <em>SOA Design Patterns</em> book Thomas Erl has shown his real qualities. The community effort behind this book is huge meaning that Thomas has had access to the knowledge and experience of a large group of accomplished practitioners. The result speaks for itself. This book is packed with proven solutions to recurring problems, and the documented pros and cons of each solution have been verified by persons with true experience. This book could give SOA initiatives of any scale a real boost.”</p><p><em>- Herbjörn Wilhelmsen, Architect and Senior Consultant, Objectware</em></p><p>“This book is an absolute milestone in SOA literature. For the first time we are provided with a practical guide on how the principle centric description of service orientation from a vendor-agnostic viewpoint is actually made to work in a language based on patterns. This book makes you talk SOA! There are very few who understand SOA like Thomas Erl does, he actually put’s it all together!”</p><p><em>- Brian Lokhorst, Solution Architect, Dutch Tax Office</em></p><p>“Service oriented architecture is all about best practices we have learned since IT’s existence. This book takes all those best practices and bundles them into a nice pattern catalogue. [It provides] a really excellent approach as patterns are not just documented but are provided with application scenarios through case studies [which] fills the gap between theory and practice.”</p><p><em>- Shakti Sharma, Senior Enterprise Architect, Sysco Corp</em></p><p>“An excellent and important book on solving problems in SOA [with a] solid structure. Has the potential of being among the major influential books.”</p><p><em>- Peter Chang, Lawrence Technical University</em></p><p>“<em>SOA Design Patterns</em> presents a vast amount of knowledge about how to successfully implement SOA within an organization. The information is clear, concise, and most importantly, legitimate.”</p><p><em>- Peter B. Woodhull, President and Principal Architect, Modus21</em></p><p>“<em>SOA Design Patterns</em> offers real insights into everyday problems that one will encounter when investing in services oriented architecture. [It] provides a number of problem descriptions and offers strategies for dealing with these problems. SOA design patterns highlights more than just the technical problems and solutions. Common organizational issues that can hinder progress towards achieving SOA migration are explained along with potential approaches for dealing with these real world challenges. Once again Thomas Erl provides in-depth coverage of SOA terminology and helps the reader better understand and appreciate the complexities of migrating to an SOA environment.”</p><p><em>- David Michalowicz, Air and Space Operations Center Modernization Team Lead,</em></p><p><em>MITRE Corporation</em></p><p>“This is a long overdue, serious, comprehensive, and well-presented catalog of SOA design patterns. This will be required reading and reference for all our SOA engineers and architects. The best of the series so far!</p><p>[The book] works in two ways: as a primer in SOA design and architecture it can easily be read front-to-back to get an overview of most of the key design issues you will encounter, and as a reference catalog of design techniques that can be referred to again and again…”</p><p><em>- Wendell Ocasio, Architecture Consultant, DoD Military Health Systems, Agilex Technologies</em></p><p>“Thomas has once again provided the SOA practitioner with a phenomenal collection of</p><p>knowledge. This is a reference that I will come back to time and time again as I move forward in SOA design efforts.</p><p>What I liked most about this book is its vendor agnostic approach to SOA design patterns. This approach really presents the reader with an understanding of why or why not to implement a pattern, group patterns, or use compound patterns rather than giving them a marketing spiel on why one implementation of a pattern is better than another (for example, why one ESB is better than another). I think as SOA adoption continues to advance, the ability for architects to understand when and why to apply specific patterns will be a driving factor in the overall success and evolution of SOA. Additionally, I believe that this book provides the consumer with the understanding required to chose which vendor’s SOA products are right for their specific needs.”</p><p><em>- Bryan Brew, SOA Consultant, Booz Allen Hamilton</em></p><p>“A must have for every SOA practitioner.”</p><p><em>- Richard Van Schelven, Principal Engineer, Ericsson</em></p><p>“This book is a long-expected successor to the books on object-oriented design patterns and integration patterns. It is a great reference book that clearly and thoroughly describes design patterns for SOA. A great read for architects who are facing the challenge of transforming their enterprise into a service-oriented enterprise.”</p><p><em>- Linda Terlouw, Solution Architect, Ordina</em></p><p>“The maturation of Service-Orientation has given the industry time to absorb the best practices of service development. Thomas Erl has amassed this collective wisdom in <em>SOA Design Patterns</em>, an absolutely indispensible addition to any Service Oriented bookshelf.”</p><p><em>- Kevin P. Davis, Ph.D</em></p><p>“The problem with most texts on SOA is one of specificity. Architects responsible for SOA implementation in most organizations have little time for abstract theories on the subject, but are hungry for concrete details that they can relate to the real problems they face in their environment. <em>SOA Design Patterns</em> is critical reading for anyone with service design responsibilities. Not only does the text provide the normal pattern templates, but each pattern is applied in detail against a background case study to provide exceptionally meaningful context to the information. The graphic visualizations of the problems and pattern solutions are excellent supplementary companions to the explanatory text. This book will greatly stretch the knowledge of the reader as much for raising and addressing issues that may have never occurred to the reader as it does in treating those problems that are in more common occurrence. The real beauty of this book is in its plain English prose. Unlike so many technical reference books, one does not find themselves re-reading sections multiple times trying to discern the intent of the author. This is also not a reference that will sit gathering dust on a shelf after one or two perusings. Practitioners will find themselves returning over and over to utilize the knowledge in their projects. This is as close as you’ll come to having a service design expert sitting over your shoulder.”</p><p><em>- James Kinneavy, Principal Software Architect, University of California</em></p><p>“As the industry converges on SOA patterns, Erl provides an outstanding reference guide to composition and integration–and yet another distinctive contribution to the SOA practice.”</p><p><em>- Steve Birkel, Chief IT Technical Architect, Intel Corp.</em></p><p>“With <em>SOA Design Patterns</em>, Thomas Erl adds an indispensable SOA reference volume to the technologist’s library. Replete with to-the-point examples, it will be a helpful aid to any IT organization.”</p><p><em>- Ed Dodds, Strategist, Systems Architect, Conmergence</em></p><p>“Again, Thomas Erl has written an indispensable guide to SOA. Building on his prior successes, his patterns go into even more detail. Therefore, this book is not only helpful to the SOA beginner, but also provides new insight and ideas to professionals.”</p><p><em>- Philipp Offermann, Research Scientist, Technische Universität Berlin, Germany</em></p><p>“<em>SOA Design Patterns</em> is an extraordinary contribution to SOA best practices! Once again, Thomas has created an indispensable resource for any person or organization interested in or actively engaged in the practice of Service Oriented Architecture. Using case studies based on three very different business models, Thomas guides the reader through the process of selecting appropriate implementation patterns to ensure a flexible, well-performing, and secure SOA ecosystem.”</p><p><em>- Victor Brown, Managing Partner and Principal Consultant,</em></p><p><em>Cypress Management Group Corporation</em></p><p>In cooperation with experts and practitioners throughout the SOA community, best-selling author Thomas Erl brings together the de facto catalog of design patterns for SOA and service-orientation. More than three years in development and subjected to numerous industry reviews, the 85 patterns in this full-color book provide the most successful and proven design techniques to overcoming the most common and critical problems to achieving modern-day SOA. Through numerous examples, individually documented pattern profiles, and over 400 color illustrations, this book provides in-depth coverage of: • Patterns for the design, implementation, and governance of service inventories–collections of services representing individual service portfolios that can be independently modeled, designed, and evolved. • Patterns specific to service-level architecture which pertain to a wide range of design areas, including contract design, security, legacy encapsulation, reliability, scalability, and a variety of implementation and governance issues. • Service composition patterns that address the many aspects associated with combining services into aggregate distributed solutions, including topics such as runtime messaging and message design, inter-service security controls, and transformation. • Compound patterns (such as Enterprise Service Bus and Orchestration) and recommended pattern application sequences that establish foundational processes. The book begins by establishing SOA types that are referenced throughout the patterns and then form the basis of a final chapter that discusses the architectural impact of service-oriented computing in general. These chapters bookend the pattern catalog to provide a clear link between SOA design patterns, the strategic goals of service-oriented computing, different SOA types, and the service-orientation design paradigm.</p><p>This book series is further supported by a series of resources sites, including <strong>soabooks.com, soaspecs.com, soapatterns.org, soamag.com,</strong> and <strong>soaposters.com.</strong></p></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><div>See how Domain-Driven Design (DDD) combines with Jakarta EE MicroProfile or Spring Boot to offer a complete suite for building enterprise-grade applications. In this book you will see how these all come together in one of the most efficient ways to develop complex software, with a particular focus on the DDD process.   </div><div><br/></div><div><i>Practical Domain-Driven Design in Enterprise Java </i>starts by building out the Cargo Tracker reference application as a monolithic application using the Jakarta EE platform. By doing so, you will map concepts of DDD (bounded contexts, language, and aggregates) to the corresponding available tools (CDI, JAX-RS, and JPA) within the Jakarta EE platform. </div><br/><div>Once you have completed the monolithic application, you will walk through the complete conversion of the monolith to a microservices-based architecture, again mapping the concepts of DDD and the corresponding available tools within the MicroProfile platform (config, discovery, and fault tolerance). To finish this section, you will examine the same microservices architecture on the Spring Boot platform. </div><div><br/></div><div>The final set of chapters looks at what the application would be like if you used the CQRS and event sourcing patterns. Here you’ll use the Axon framework as the base framework. </div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><b>What You Will Learn</b><br/></div><div><ul><li>Discover the DDD architectural principles and use the DDD design patterns<br/></li><li>Use the new Eclipse Jakarta EE platform <br/></li><li>Work with the Spring Boot framework<br/></li><li>Implement microservices design patterns, including context mapping, logic design, entities, integration, testing, and security<br/></li><li>Carry out event sourcing<br/></li><li>Apply CQRS <br/></li></ul></div><div><br/></div><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b></div><div><br/></div><div>Junior developers intending to start working on enterprise Java; senior developers transitioning from monolithic- to microservices-based architectures; and architects transitioning to a DDD philosophy of building applications.</div><div><br/></div></span>",

[It] shows you how\nto begin applying such things as TDD, object relational mapping,\nand DDD to .NET projects...techniques that many developers think\nare the key to future software development.... As the technology\ngets more capable and sophisticated, it becomes more important to\nunderstand how to use it well. This book is a valuable step toward\nadvancing that understanding.”</em></p><p>\n–Martin Fowler, author of <em>Refactoring</em> and <em>Patterns\nof Enterprise Application Architecture</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p>Patterns, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and\nTest-Driven Development (TDD) enable architects and developers to\ncreate systems that are powerful, robust, and maintainable. Now,\nthere’s a comprehensive, practical guide to leveraging all\nthese techniques primarily in Microsoft .NET environments, but the\ndiscussions are just as useful for Java developers.</p><p>Drawing on seminal work by Martin Fowler\n(<em>Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</em>) and Eric\nEvans (<em>Domain-Driven Design</em>), Jimmy Nilsson shows how to\ncreate real-world architectures for any .NET application. Nilsson\nilluminates each principle with clear, well-annotated code examples\nbased on C# 1.1 and 2.0. His examples and discussions will be\nvaluable both to C# developers and those working with other .NET\nlanguages and any databases–even with other platforms, such\nas J2EE.

Design patterns are commonly accepted solutions to well-recognized design problems. In essence, they are a library of reusable components, only for software architecture, and not for a concrete implementation.\n</p><p>The focus of this book is on the design patterns that naturally lend themselves to the needs of a C++ programmer, and on the patterns that uniquely benefit from the features of C++, in particular, the generic programming. Armed with the knowledge of these patterns, you will spend less time searching for a solution to a common problem and be familiar with the solutions developed from experience, as well as their advantages and drawbacks. The other use of design patterns is as a concise and an efficient way to communicate. A pattern is a familiar and instantly recognizable solution to specific problem; through its use, sometimes with a single line of code, we can convey a considerable amount of information. The code conveys: \"This is the problem we are facing, these are additional considerations that are most important in our case; hence, the following well-known solution was chosen.\"\n</p><p>By the end of this book, you will have gained a comprehensive understanding of design patterns to create robust, reusable, and maintainable code.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Recognize the most common design patterns used in C++\n</li><li>Understand how to use C++ generic programming to solve common design problems\n</li><li>Explore the most powerful C++ idioms, their strengths, and drawbacks\n</li><li>Rediscover how to use popular C++ idioms with generic programming\n</li><li>Understand the impact of design patterns on the program's performance\n</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book is for experienced C++ developers and programmers who wish to learn about software design patterns and principles and apply them to create robust, reusable, and easily maintainable apps.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>Architects of buildings and architects of software have more in common than most people think. Both professions require attention to detail, and both practitioners will see their work collapse around them if they make too many mistakes.  It's impossible to imagine a world in which buildings get built without blueprints, but it's still common for software applications to be designed and built without blueprints, or in this case, design patterns.A software design pattern can be identified as \"a recurring solution to a recurring problem.\" Using design patterns for software development makes sense in the same way that architectural design patterns make sense--if it works well in one place, why not use it in another?  But developers have had enough of books that simply catalog design patterns without extending into new areas, and books that are so theoretical that you can't actually do anything better after reading them than you could before you started.Crawford and Kaplan's <i>J2EE Design Patterns</i> approaches the subject in a unique, highly practical and pragmatic way. Rather than simply present another catalog of design patterns, the authors broaden the scope by discussing ways to choose design patterns when building an enterprise application from scratch, looking closely at the real world tradeoffs that Java developers must weigh when architecting their applications. Then they go on to show how to apply the patterns when writing realworld software.  They also extend design patterns into areas not covered in other books, presenting original patterns for data modeling, transaction / process modeling, and interoperability.<i>J2EE Design Patterns</i> offers extensive coverage of the five problem areas enterprise developers face:</p><ul><li>Maintenance (Extensibility)</li><li>Performance (System Scalability)</li><li>Data Modeling (Business Object Modeling)</li><li>Transactions (process Modeling)</li><li>Messaging (Interoperability)</li></ul>And with its careful balance between theory and practice, <i>J2EE Design Patterns</i> will give developers new to the Java enterprise development arena a solid understanding of how to approach a wide variety of architectural and procedural problems, and will give experienced J2EE pros an opportunity to extend and improve on their existing experience.</div></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><span><span><p>As UX becomes increasingly Agile, a need arises to quickly create and iterate new interface elements. Many popular frameworks exist to document front-end design patterns. Most of them connect directly to the website's CSS, and help developers easily create new interface elements and templates. But what happens when the design and UX team aren't working in the site's CSS? How can we create truly cross-functional design documentation that works both for developers and designers?In this webcast, Harvard Business Review's Senior UX Designer, Dani Nordin, will describe the process we have been working on to document existing design patterns and create a working set of elements that allow both for rapid iteration of design prototypes and implementation of templates in code.Target audience:UX designers in cross-functional teams who need to create and iterate on interfaces in rapid, Agile environments.Product owners and project managers who need ways to speed up the development of new features without sacrificing great designFront-end developers who want to help designers \"design in the browser\" without learning a bunch of specialized code.Key takeaways:The benefits of working in repeatable design patternsThe basic structure of pattern libraries: what goes in it and whyMoving beyond colors and fonts; extending the approach</p></span></span></span></span></span>",

Basic object-oriented C# programming experience and an elementary familiarity with the .NET framework library is required.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Put patterns and pattern catalogs into the right perspective</li><li>Apply patterns for software development under C#/.NET</li><li>Use GoF and other patterns in real-life development scenarios</li><li>Be able to enrich your design vocabulary and well articulate your design thoughts</li><li>Leverage object/functional programming by mixing OOP and FP</li><li>Understand the reactive programming model using Rx and RxJs</li><li>Writing compositional code using C# LINQ constructs</li><li>Be able to implement concurrent/parallel programming techniques using idioms under .NET</li><li>Avoiding pitfalls when creating compositional, readable, and maintainable code using imperative, functional, and reactive code.</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Knowing about design patterns enables developers to improve their code base, promoting code reuse and making their design more robust.</p><p>This book focuses on the practical aspects of programming in .NET. You will learn about some of the relevant design patterns (and their application) that are most widely used. We start with classic object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques, evaluate parallel programming and concurrency models, enhance implementations by mixing OOP and functional programming, and finally to the reactive programming model where functional programming and OOP are used in synergy to write better code.</p><p>Throughout this book, we'll show you how to deal with architecture/design techniques, GoF patterns, relevant patterns from other catalogs, functional programming, and reactive programming techniques.</p><p>After reading this book, you will be able to convincingly leverage these design patterns (factory pattern, builder pattern, prototype pattern, adapter pattern, facade pattern, decorator pattern, observer pattern and so on) for your programs. You will also be able to write fluid functional code in .NET that would leverage concurrency and parallelism!</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This tutorial-based book takes a step-by-step approach. It covers the major patterns and explains them in a detailed manned along with code examples.</p></span>",

For each pattern you will see at least one real-world scenario, a computer-world example, and a complete implementation including output.</p><p>This book has three parts. The first part covers 23 Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns. The second part includes three alternative design patterns. The third part presents criticisms of design patterns with an overview of anti-patterns. You will work through easy-to-follow examples to understand the concepts in depth and you will have a collection of programs to port over to your own projects.</p><p>A Q&amp;A session is included in each chapter and covers the pros and cons of each pattern. The last chapter presents FAQs about the design patterns. The step-by-step approach of the book helps you apply your skills to learn other patterns on your own, and to be familiar with the latest version of Java and Eclipse.<br/></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What You'll Learn </b><br/></p><p></p><ul><li>Work with each of the design patterns<br/></li><li>Implement design patterns in real-world applications<br/></li><li>Choose from alternative design patterns by comparing their pros and cons<br/></li><li>Use the Eclipse IDE to write code and generate output<br/></li><li>Read the in-depth Q&amp;A session in each chapter with pros and cons for each design pattern<br/></li></ul><div><br/></div><div><b>Who This Book Is For </b></div><div><br/></div><div>Software developers, architects, and programmers</div></span>",

It will be very useful to engineers with beginner level proficiency in Python and who love to work with Python 3.5</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li><p>Enhance your skills to create better software architecture</p></li><li><p>Understand proven solutions to commonly occurring design issues</p></li><li><p>Explore the design principles that form the basis of software design, such as loose coupling, the Hollywood principle and the Open Close principle among others</p></li><li><p>Delve into the object-oriented programming concepts and find out how they are used in software applications</p></li><li><p>Develop an understanding of Creational Design Patterns and the different object creation methods that help you solve issues in software development</p></li><li><p>Use Structural Design Patterns and find out how objects and classes interact to build larger applications</p></li><li><p>Focus on the interaction between objects with the command and observer patterns</p></li><li><p>Improve the productivity and code base of your application using Python design patterns</p></li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>With the increasing focus on optimized software architecture and design it is important that software architects think about optimizations in object creation, code structure, and interaction between objects at the architecture or design level. This makes sure that the cost of software maintenance is low and code can be easily reused or is adaptable to change. The key to this is reusability and low maintenance in design patterns.\nBuilding on the success of the previous edition, Learning Python Design Patterns, Second Edition will help you implement real-world scenarios with Python's latest release, Python v3.5.\n</p><p>We start by introducing design patterns from the Python perspective. As you progress through the book, you will learn about Singleton patterns, Factory patterns, and Façade patterns in detail. After this, we'll look at how to control object access with proxy patterns. It also covers observer patterns, command patterns, and compound patterns.\nBy the end of the book, you will have enhanced your professional abilities in software architecture, design, and development.\n</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This is an easy-to-follow guide to design patterns with hands-on examples of real-world scenarios and their implementation in Python v3.5. Each topic is explained and placed in context, and for the more inquisitive, there are more details on the concepts used.</p></span>",

This approach is fundamentally flawed, because you can't see how the design patterns actually function in the real world. Most programmers learn by looking at computer programs.</p><p><i>Holub on Patterns: Learning Design Patterns by Looking at Code</i> teaches you design patterns in exactly this way: by looking at computer programs and analyzing them in terms of the patterns that they use. Consequently, you learn how the patterns actually occur in the real world and how to apply the patterns to solve real problems.</p><p>This book also looks at the broader context of object-oriented (OO) design and how patterns solve commonplace OO design problems. It covers many of the principles of OO design—principles not covered by most books on Java—and shows you how to apply these principles to make your code easier to maintain and debug.</p></span></span>",

However, understanding and learning design patterns can be time-consuming and intimidating, but this course has got you covered! With Creational Design Patterns in Modern C++, you’ll learn how to understand and implement creational design patterns in C++ with the help of engaging examples.</p><p>The course begins with an introduction to creational patterns, giving you a tour of UML class diagrams and SOLID principles. You’ll become familiar with logger classes, multithreading, and patterns and gain a solid understanding of singletons in C++. As you progress, you’ll get to grips with the factory method and find out how to implement it in the application framework. Once you’ve covered the intent, structure, and implementation of the object pool pattern, you’ll discover how to use the abstract factory pattern. Finally, you’ll delve into prototype implementation with the help of a gaming example and apply the builder pattern.</p><p>By the end of this course, you’ll have developed skills needed to create and implement patterns in modern C++.</p></span>",

You'll explore the component scale as you discover patterns oriented toward small chunks of the software, and then move to application-scale patterns and techniques to understand higher-level patterns and how to structure the application as a whole. The book covers a range of significant GoF (Gangs of Four) design patterns such as strategy, singleton, decorator, facade, and composite. The chapters are organized based on scale and topics, allowing you to start small and build on a strong base, the same way that you would develop a program. With the help of use cases, the book will show you how to combine design patterns to display alternate usage and help you feel comfortable working with a variety of design patterns.

The completeness that Arlow and Neustadt\nprovide in these patterns is impressive. The explanations for why\nthe patterns are formed the way they are and how they’re\ninterconnected are incredibly thorough. The patterns presented here\nhave the potential to impact business applications in the same way\nthe ‘Gang of Four’ patterns have impacted general\nsoftware development.”</p><p>\n         —<b>Steve\nVinoski</b><br/>\n             Chief\nEngineer of Product Innovation<br/>\n              IONA\nTechnologies</p><p>&amp;#8220<em>Enterprise Patterns and MDA</em> is a detailed, yet\nvery readable, guide to designing business applications using\nreusable model components and Model Driven Architecture.

Now that Model Driven Architecture is raising software\ndesign to ever-higher levels of abstraction, it is only natural\nthat pattern concepts should find application in advanced modeling\ntechniques. With this book, Arlow and Neustadt have greatly\nadvanced the state of the art of MDA by defining both a theory and\na methodology for applying the concept of Archetype Patterns to\nbusiness software modeling.”</p><p>\n         —<b>John\nPoole</b><br/>\n             Distinguished\nSoftware Engineer<br/>\n             Hyperion\nSolutions Corporation<br/></p><p>“The burgeoning field of Model Driven Architecture tools\nand worldwide support for the Unified Modeling Language are finally\nbeing met with high-quality books that explain standard modeling\ntechniques in a way any developer can follow. This book meets an\nurgent need squarely and clearly, and explains with copious\nexamples a powerful approach to building usable (and reusable!)\nassets and applications. Every enterprise developer needs this\nbook.”</p><p>\n         —<b>Richard\nMark Soley, Ph.D.</b><br/>\n           \nChairman and CEO<br/>\n           \nObject Management Group</p><p>This book is a practical guide to applying Model Driven\nArchitecture (MDA) and patterns in order to create business\napplications more easily. It provides you with a proven catalog of\narchetype patterns: high-value model components that can be easily\nincorporated into Unified Modeling Language (UML) models. Each\narchetype pattern allows you to understand and model a specific\npart of an enterprise system.</p><p><b><em>Enterprise Patterns and MDA</em></b> teaches you how to\ncustomize any archetype pattern—such as Customer, Product,\nand Order—to reflect the idiosyncrasies of your own business\nenvironment. Because all the patterns work harmoniously together\nand have clearly documented relationships to each other,\nyou’ll come away with a host of reusable solutions to common\nproblems in business-software design.</p><p>This book shows you how using a pattern or a fragment of a\npattern can save you months of work and help you avoid costly\nerrors. You’ll also discover how—when used in literate\nmodeling—patterns can solve the difficult challenge of\ncommunicating UML models to broad audiences.</p><p>The configurable patterns can be used manually to create\nexecutable code. However, the authors draw on their extensive\nexperience to show you how to tap the significant power of MDA and\nUML for maximum automation. Not surprisingly, the patterns included\nin this book are highly valuable; a blue-chip company recently\nvalued a similar, but less mature, set of patterns at hundreds of\nthousands of dollars.</p><p>Use this practical guide to increase the efficiency of your\ndesigns and to create robust business applications that can be\napplied immediately in a business setting.</p><p><br/><br/></p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p><b>A Hands-On Guide and Introduction to Quartz 2D</b></p><p>On Mac OS X, Macintosh\ndevelopers depend on the graphics and imaging frameworks of the\nCore Graphics system to implement multimedia features in their\napplications. With Core Graphics Apple has answered the increasing\ndemands of graphics developers with a powerful collection of tools,\nincluding Quartz 2D and Core Image. Quartz 2D is a modern drawing\nAPI with a powerful imaging model. Beginning with Mac OS X 10.4,\nTiger, Quartz 2D replaces the QuickDraw® graphics library in\nlegacy applications and provides the functionality developers need\nto take advantage of the latest hardware.</p><p><em>Quartz 2D Graphics\nfor Mac OS X® Developers</em> is a hands-on guide and\nintroduction to Quartz 2D. Differences between the interfaces and\nfeatures of QuickDraw and Quartz 2D are making the switch\nchallenging for developers. Through in-depth practical coverage,\nMac developer and consultant Scott Thompson leads you smoothly\nthrough the transition and sets you on the path to developing\ncutting edge graphics in Core Image.</p><p>Through this invaluable\nguide, you will learn how to</p><li><p>Forge connections between Quartz 2D and graphics devices using\nCGContexts</p></li><li><p>Simplify the drawing process using transformations</p></li><li><p>Draw line art using path-drawing operations on Bezier\npaths</p></li><li><p>Use pixel data to create images</p></li><li><p>Import and export images from Quartz 2D with Image I/O and\nQuickTime</p></li><li><p>Generate text and implement special text effects</p></li><li><p>Draw in offscreen environments, such as CGLayers and offscreen\nbitmaps</p></li><li><p>Create shadings and patterns</p></li><li><p>Create PDFs from Quartz 2D drawings or import PDFs into your\ndrawings</p></li><p>If you depend on\nQuickDraw for your graphics needs, or are interested in a system\nthat pushes the envelope in computer graphics, now is the time to\nmake the switch to Core Graphics (Quartz 2D, Core Image). This is\nthe book that walks you through that change–step-by-step!</p><p>The companion CD-ROM\ncontains projects and source code covered in this book so you can\nrun each sample. The samples demonstrate how to call Quartz 2D from\nboth Carbon and Cocoa applications as well as from Mac OS X’s\nPython scripting interface.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p><i>“Ninety-five percent of the words are spent extolling the benefits of ‘modularity’ and that little, if anything, is said about how to achieve it”—Glenford J. Myers, 1978.</i></p><p>The above quote is 40 years old. Today, four decades later, nothing has changed except terminology. Time to fix this.</p><p>Vladik Khononov (Invesus Group) explains how to decompose a system into loosely coupled components: how to draw boundaries between services, how to decide whether some logic belongs to one service or another, and how domain-driven design can help us make those decisions. Finally, he takes a stab at answering the age-old question of what part of a microservice should be “micro” and how it can be measured.</p><p>You’ll hear about neither Docker nor Kubernetes. Actually, nothing related to infrastructure. Instead, you’ll dive into the difference between microservices and bounded contexts, discover when each pattern should be used, and get takeaways from Vladik’s experience optimizing microservices-quotebased architectures at Naxex.</p><p>This session was recorded at the 2019 O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference in San Jose.</p></div></span>",

All patterns present extensive examples and known uses in multiple programming languages, including C++, C, and Java.</p><p>The book can be used to tackle specific software development problems or read from cover to cover to provide a fundamental understanding of the best practices for constructing concurrent and networked applications and middleware.</p><p>About the Authors</p><p>This book has been written by the award winning team responsible for the first POSA volume \"A System of Patterns\", joined in this volume by Douglas C. Schmidt from University of California, Irvine (UCI), USA.</p><p>Visit our Web Page</p></span></span></span>",

Design patterns exemplify the principles and strong practices that developers can depend on to build high-quality solutions. Developers can rely on these essential skills to guide their design considerations. Scott L.

Software developers, architects, and technical management teams rely on high-level software design patterns such as microservices architecture, event-driven architecture, and the strategic patterns prescribed by domain-driven design (DDD) to make their work easier.</p><p>This book covers these proven architecture design patterns with a forward-looking approach to help Python developers manage application complexity—and get the most value out of their test suites.</p><p>Starting with the initial stages of design, you will learn about the main blocks and mental flow to use at the start of a project. The book covers various architectural patterns like microservices, web services, and event-driven structures and how to choose the one best suited to your project. Establishing a foundation of required concepts, you will progress into development, debugging, and testing to produce high-quality code that is ready for deployment. You will learn about ongoing operations on how to continue the task after the system is deployed to end users, as the software development lifecycle is never finished.</p><p>By the end of this Python book, you will have developed \"architectural thinking\": a different way of approaching software design, including making changes to ongoing systems.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Think like an architect, analyzing software architecture patterns</li><li>Explore API design, data storage, and data representation methods</li><li>Investigate the nuances of common architectural structures</li><li>Utilize and interoperate elements of patterns such as microservices</li><li>Implement test-driven development to perform quality code testing</li><li>Recognize chunks of code that can be restructured as packages</li><li>Maintain backward compatibility and deploy iterative changes</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book will help software developers and architects understand the structure of large complex systems and adopt architectural patterns that are scalable. Examples in the book are implemented in Python so a fair grasp of basic Python concepts is expected. Proficiency in any programming languages such as Java or JavaScript is sufficient.</p></span>",

Therefore, over time programmers applied varying solutions to these problems, and this is how design patterns were born.</p><p>This course will walk you through some centrally significant design patterns so that you can easily resolve programming issues encountered in your day-to-day tasks. You'll learn these patterns in one of the most modern languages: Kotlin! We cover the three major areas in design patterns: creational patterns, structural patterns, and behavioral patterns. We also implement one structural pattern—Decorators—that plays an important role in adding functionalities to your programs. We take a look at different kinds of problem and implement the required patterns while avoiding common pitfalls.

However, understanding and learning design patterns is tough and time-consuming. This course will help you to get acquainted with the design patterns and teach you some useful techniques to implement them in modern C++.</p><p>The course starts with an introduction to design patterns and explains the structure of a pattern with the help of a Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagram. Then, you will understand how to implement a design pattern, how to examine the issues, and how to refactor the code by studying different types of design patterns such as adapter, facade, proxy, decorator, composite, bridge, and flyweight. In addition to this, you will also learn about the pros and cons of each pattern.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will be well-versed with various structural design patterns and will have developed the skills to implement them in modern C++.</p></span>",

Prior knowledge of Salesforce and Force.com platform is recommended.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Apply OOPs principal in Apex to design a robust and efficient solution to address various facets to a business problem</li><li>Get to grips with the benefits and applicability of using different design patterns in Apex</li><li>Solve problems while instantiating, structuring and giving dynamic behavior to Apex classes</li><li>Understand the implementation of creational, structural, behavioral, concurrency and anti-patterns in your application</li><li>Follow the Apex best practices to resolve governor limit issues</li><li>Get clued up about the Inheritance, abstract classes, polymorphism in Apex to deal with the object mechanism</li><li>Master various design patterns and determine the best out of them</li><li>Explore the anti patterns that could not be applied to Apex and their appropriate solutions</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Apex is an on-demand programming language providing a complete set of features for building business applications ? including data models and objects to manage data. Apex being a proprietor programming language from Salesforce to be worked with multi tenant environment is a lot different than traditional OOPs languages like Java and C#. It acts as a workflow engine for managing collaboration of the data between users, a user interface model to handle forms and other interactions, and a SOAP API for programmatic access and integration.</p><p>Apex Design Patterns gives you an insight to several problematic situations that can arise while developing on Force.com platform and the usage of Design patterns to solve them. Packed with real life examples, it gives you a walkthrough from learning design patterns that Apex can offer us, to implementing the appropriate ones in your own application. Furthermore, we learn about the creational patterns that deal with object creation mechanism and structural patterns that helps to identify the relationship between entities. Also, the behavioural and concurrency patterns are put forward explaining the communication between objects and multi-threaded programming paradigm respectively. We later on, deal with the issues regarding structuring of classes, instantiating or how to give a dynamic behaviour at a runtime, with the help of anti-patterns. We learn the basic OOPs principal in polymorphic and modular way to enhance its capability. Also, best practices of writing Apex code are explained to differentiate between the implementation of appropriate patterns. This book will also explain some unique patterns that could be applied to get around governor limits.</p><p>By the end of this book, you will be a maestro in developing your applications on Force.com for Salesforce</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This book is a step-by-step guide, complete with well-tested programs and real world situations to solve your common occurring problems in Apex design by using the anti-patterns. It gets crackling from exploring every appropriate solution to comparing the best one as per OOps principal.</p></span>",

This book focuses on design patterns applied to the Delphi language. The book will provide you with insights into the language and its capabilities of a runtime library.\n</p><p>You'll start by exploring a variety of design patterns and understanding them through real-world examples. This will entail a short explanation of the concept of design patterns and the original set of the 'Gang of Four' patterns, which will help you in structuring your designs efficiently. Next, you'll cover the most important 'anti-patterns' (essentially bad software development practices) to aid you in steering clear of problems during programming. You'll then learn about the eight most important patterns for each creational, structural, and behavioral type. After this, you'll be introduced to the concept of 'concurrency' patterns, which are design patterns specifically related to multithreading and parallel computation. These will enable you to develop and improve an interface between items and harmonize shared memories within threads. Toward the concluding chapters, you'll explore design patterns specific to program design and other categories of patterns that do not fall under the 'design' umbrella.\n</p><p>By the end of this book, you'll be able to address common design problems encountered while developing applications and feel confident while building scalable projects.\n</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Gain insights into the concept of design patterns\n</li><li>Study modern programming techniques with Delphi\n</li><li>Keep up to date with the latest additions and program design techniques in Delphi\n</li><li>Get to grips with various modern multithreading approaches\n</li><li>Discover creational, structural, behavioral, and concurrent patterns\n</li><li>Determine how to break a design problem down into its component parts</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>Hands-On Design Patterns with Delphi is aimed at beginner-level Delphi developers who want to build scalable and robust applications. Basic knowledge of Delphi is a must.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><b>Create various design patterns to master the art of solving problems using Python</b></p><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Python is an object-oriented, scripting language that is used in wide range of categories. In software engineering, a design pattern is a recommended solution to a software design problem. Although not new, design patterns remain one of the hottest topics in software engineering and they come as a ready reference for software developers to solve the common problems they face at work.</p><p>This book will take you through each and every design pattern explained with the help of real-world examples. The aim of the book is to introduce more low-level detail and concepts on how to write Pythonic code, not just focusing on common solutions as implemented in Java and C++. It includes small sections on troubleshooting, best practices, system architecture, and its design aspects. With the help of this book, you will be able to understand Python design pattern concepts and the framework, as well as issues and their resolution. You'll focus on all 16 design patterns that are used to solve everyday problems.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Explore Factory Method and Abstract Factory for object creation</li><li>Clone objects using the Prototype pattern</li><li>Make incompatible interfaces compatible using the Adapter pattern</li><li>Secure an interface using the Proxy pattern</li><li>Choose an algorithm dynamically using the Strategy pattern</li><li>Extend an object without subclassing using the Decorator pattern</li><li>Keep the logic decoupled from the UI using the MVC pattern</li></ul></span>",

In this O'Reilly report, authors Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Robson show you how object-oriented design patterns are ideal for solving specific problems in application design.</p><p>Instead of algorithms or code, design patterns are all about reusing the experience of developers who have devised well thought-out, time-tested solutions to object-oriented programming problems. Using O'Reilly's unique Head First methodology, this report details how a particular design pattern can solve a non-obvious design problem. You also get a Patterns Cheat Sheet that briefly describes several design patterns and provides tips for using patterns in general.</p><p>This report explains why:</p><ul><li>Design patterns tell you how to structure classes and objects to solve certain problems</li><li>They allow you to create flexible designs that are maintainable and cope with change</li><li>It’s your job to adapt a pattern to fit your particular application</li><li>All design patterns provide a way to let some part of a system vary independently from all other parts</li><li>Patterns provide a shared vocabulary that lets your team think at the pattern level, rather than at the nitty-gritty object level</li></ul></div></span>",

    "title": "Mindful Design: How and Why to Make Design Decisions for the Good of Those Using Your Product",
    "description": "<span><p></p><p>Learn to create seamless designs backed by a responsible understanding of the human mind. This book examines how human behavior can be used to integrate your product design into lifestyle, rather than interrupt it, and make decisions for the good of those that are using your product. </p><p><i>Mindful Design</i> introduces the areas of brain science that matter to designers, and passionately explains how those areas affect each human’s day-to-day experiences with products and interfaces. You will learn about the neurological aspects and limitations of human vision and perception; about our attachment to harmony and dissonance, such as visual harmony, musical harmony; and about our brain’s propensity towards pattern recognition and how we perceive the world cognitively.  </p><p>In the second half of the book you will focus on the practical application of what you have learned, specific to interaction and interface design. Real-world examples are used throughout so that you can really see how design is impacting our everyday digital experience.<br/></p><p>Design is a responsibility, but not enough designers understand the human mind or the process of thought. This book explores the key factors involved and shows you how to make the right design choices.<br/></p><p><b>What You'll Learn</b></p><p></p><ul><li>Review how attention and distraction work and the cost of attentional switching<br/></li><li>Use Gestalt principles to communicate visual grouping<br/></li><li>Ensure your underlying models make sense to your audience<br/></li><li>Use time, progression, and transition to create a composition<br/></li><li>Carefully examine controlling behavior through reductionist and behaviorist motivation concepts <br/></li><li>Apply the theoretical knowledge to practical, mindful application design<br/></li></ul><p></p><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p>\n\nThe primary audience for this book is professional designers who wish to learn more about the human mind and how to apply that to their work. The book is also useful for design-focussed product owners and startup founders who wish to apply ethical thinking to a team, or when bootstrapping their products. The secondary audience is design students who are either studying a ‘traditional’ visual design course, or a UX/interaction design course who have a desire to learn how they might be able to apply mindful design to their early careers. Finally, a tertiary audience for this book would be tutors involved in teaching design, or peripheral, courses who may wish to incorporate its teachings into their lectures, workshops or seminars.<p></p><br/><p></p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>2012 Jolt Award Finalist!</p><p>Even experienced software professionals find\nit difficult to apply patterns in ways that deliver substantial\nvalue to their organizations. In <b><em>Elemental Design\nPatterns,</em></b> Jason McC. Smith addresses this problem head-on,\nhelping developers harness the true power of patterns, map them to\nreal software implementations more cleanly and directly, and\nachieve far better results. Part tutorial, part example-rich\ncookbook, this resource will help developers, designers,\narchitects, and analysts successfully use patterns with a wide\nvariety of languages, environments, and problem domains. Every bit\nas important, it will give them a deeper appreciation for the work\nthey’ve chosen to pursue.</p><p>Smith presents the crucial missing link that\npatterns practitioners have needed: a foundational collection of\nsimple core patterns that are broken down to their core elements.\nIf you work in software, you may already be using some of these\nelemental design patterns every day. Presenting them in a\ncomprehensive methodology for the first time, Smith names them,\ndescribes them, explains their importance, helps you compare and\nchoose among them, and offers a framework for using them together.\nHe also introduces an innovative Pattern Instance Notation\ndiagramming system that makes it easier to work with patterns at\nmany levels of granularity, regardless of your goals or role.</p><p>If you’re new to patterns, this\nexample-rich approach will help you master them piece by piece,\nlogically and intuitively. If you’re an experienced patterns\npractitioner, Smith follows the Gang of Four format you’re\nalready familiar with, explains how his elemental patterns can be\ncomposed into conventional design patterns, and introduces highly\nproductive new ways to apply ideas you’ve already\nencountered. No matter what your level of experience, this\ninfinitely practical book will help you transform abstract patterns\ninto high-value solutions.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span>\nEver notice that—in spite of their pervasiveness—designing web applications is still challenging? While their benefits motivate their creation, there are no well-established guidelines for design. This often results in inconsistent behaviors and appearances, even among web applications created by the same company. <br/><br/>Design patterns for web applications, similar in concept to those for web sites and software design, offer an effective solution. In <i>Web Application Design Patterns</i>, Pawan Vora documents design patterns for web applications by not only identifying design solutions for user interaction problems, but also by examining the rationale for their effectiveness, and by presenting how they should be applied.<ul><li>Design interfaces faster, with a better rationale for the solutions you choose.</li><li>Learn from over more than 100 patterns, with extensive annotation on use and extension.</li><li>Take a short-cut into understanding the industry with more than 500 full-color screenshots.</li></ul>\n</span>",

    "description": "<span><p>The make-take-waste paradigm of fast fashion explains much of the producer and consumer behavior patterns towards fast fashion. The evolution from a two-season fashion calendar to fast fashion, characterized by rapid product cycles from retailers and impulse buying by consumers, presents new challenges to the environment, workplace and labour practices. </p><p>This book provides a comprehensive overview of new insights into consumer behaviour mechanisms in order to shift practices toward sustainable fashion and to minimize the negative impacts of fast fashion on the environment and society. Concepts and techniques are presented that could overcome the formidable economic drivers of fast fashion and lead toward a future of sustainable fashion. </p><p>While the need for change in the fashion industry post-Rana Plaza could not be more obvious, alternative and more sustainable consumption models have been under-investigated. The paucity of such research extends to highly consumptive consumer behaviours regarding fast fashion (i.e. impulse buying and throwaways) and the related impediments these behaviours pose for sustainable fashion.</p><p>Written by leading researchers in the field of sustainable fashion and supported by the Textile Institute, this book evaluates fashion trends, what factors have led to new trends and how the factors supporting fast fashion differ from those of the past. It explores the economic drivers of fast fashion and what social, environmental and political factors should be maintained, and business approaches adopted, in order for fast fashion to be a sustainable model. In particular, it provides consumer behaviour concepts that can be utilized at the retail level to support sustainable fashion.</p></span>",

Approaching persuasive design from the dark side, this book melds psychology, marketing, and design concepts to show why we're susceptible to certain persuasive techniques. Packed with examples from every nook and cranny of the web, it provides easily digestible and applicable patterns for putting these design techniques to work. Organized by the seven deadly sins, it includes:</p><ul><li><p>Pride — use social proof to position your product in line with your visitors' values</p></li><li><p>Sloth — build a path of least resistance that leads users where you want them to go</p></li><li><p>Gluttony — escalate customers' commitment and use loss aversion to keep them there</p></li><li><p>Anger — understand the power of metaphysical arguments and anonymity</p></li><li><p>Envy — create a culture of status around your product and feed aspirational desires</p></li><li><p>Lust — turn desire into commitment by using emotion to defeat rational behavior</p></li><li><p>Greed — keep customers engaged by reinforcing the behaviors you desire</p></li></ul><p>Now you too can leverage human fallibility to create powerful persuasive interfaces that people will love to use — but will you use your new knowledge for good or evil?

    "description": "<span><p>Software engineering and computer science students need a resource that explains how to apply design patterns at the enterprise level, allowing them to design and implement systems of high stability and quality. Software Architecture Design Patterns in Java is a detailed explanation of how to apply design patterns and develop software architectures. It provides in-depth examples in Java, and guides students by detailing when, why, and how to use specific patterns. This textbook presents 42 design patterns, including 23 GoF patterns. Categories include: Basic, Creational, Collectional, Structural, Behavioral, and Concurrency, with multiple examples for each. The discussion of each pattern includes an example implemented in Java. The source code for all examples is found on a companion Web site. The author explains the content so that it is easy to understand, and each pattern discussion includes Practice Questions to aid instructors. The textbook concludes with a case study that pulls several patterns together to demonstrate how patterns are not applied in isolation, but collaborate within domains to solve complicated problems.</p></span>",

The goal of the book is to provide the experience of Symbian's developers to a wider audience and enable sophisticated programs to be quickly written and to a high standard. In order to do this, it:</p><ul><li><p>Provides patterns based on the Symbian OS architectural elements</p></li><li><p>Describes how patterns suited for non-mobile software should be adapted or even avoided for Symbian OS</p></li><li><p>Provides Symbian OS based examples and code illustrations</p></li></ul><p>Each chapter covers patterns that address specific key concern experienced by developers: memory performance, time performance, power performance, security and responsiveness.</p><p>This book is not specific to any particular version of Symbian OS. While individual examples may come from one version or another the patterns outlined in this book are intended to be more generic and based on the common functionality available in all releases. Where possible the examples given for the design patterns will directly reflect the software in Symbian OS.</p><p><em>Common Design Patterns for Symbian OS</em> is intended to be used in conjunction with one or more SDKs for specific Symbian OS phones and with the resources available at the Symbian DevNet web site.

The fact that so many change initiatives fail or underperform can be traced back to one major issue: pace. While most change management models stress the importance of timeliness, they remain bound to an organization-wide approach to execution.. By targeting change efforts at specific mid-level layers of management, this book helps you achieve the desired outcome more efficiently while saving time, effort and money. Full of practical advice and real-world examples, this book is your action guide to making change happen in a meaningful way. You'll learn how to continually develop great leadership at the institutional level, and gain real, actionable guidance on putting more women in management positions to help you grab that competitive advantage.  </p><p>Today's disruptive technologies and macro-economic patterns have elevated organizational agility to the rank of survival skill.

    "description": "<span><span><span><p><b>Use Java CAPS to Streamline IT Services and Leverage Legacy\nApplications<br/></b><br/>\nDesign patterns are a useful tool for streamlining enterprise\nintegration and Web development projects: the mission-critical\nprojects that directly impact your competitiveness. <em>Enterprise\nIntegration Patterns</em> by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf\n(Addison-Wesley, 2004) described many of the most useful patterns\nfor enterprise developers. Until recently, however, implementing\nthe patterns in that classic reference required the extensive use\nof raw Java code. Now there’s a better alternative: Using\nSun’s Java Composite Application Suite (Java CAPS),\narchitects and developers can implement enterprise integration\npatterns succinctly, elegantly, and completely.<br/><br/>\nIn <em><b>Java™ CAPS Basics</b></em>, Sun’s own Java CAPS\nexperts show how to quickly put these new tools and technologies to\nwork in your real-world enterprise application integration\nprojects. After reviewing the challenges of enterprise integration,\nthey introduce Java CAPS and show how it can simplify the\ndevelopment of today’s state-of-the-art\n“composite” applications. Next, they bridge the gap\nbetween abstract pattern languages and practical implementation\ndetails. You will learn essential Java CAPS concepts and methods in\nthe context of the patterns you’ll actually use for\nreal-world message and system management.<br/><br/>\nCoverage includes<br/></p><li><p>Comparing approaches to enterprise application integration and\nfinding ways to integrate non-invasively, with fewer changes and\nlower costs</p></li><li><p>Mastering the core integration tools provided by Java CAPS:\neGate, eInsight, eWays and JMS</p></li><li><p>Using enterprise integration patterns to improve application\nreusability, scalability, resilience, security, and\nmanageability</p></li><li><p>Implementing patterns for message exchange, correlation,\ninfrastructure, routing, construction, transformation, and\nendpoints</p></li><li><p>Generating and using cryptographic objects such as X.509\nCertificates, PKCS#12, and JKS Keystores</p></li><li><p>Using advanced techniques such as solution partitioning and\nsubprocess implementation, many of which are covered nowhere\nelse</p></li><li><p>Constructing two complete example solutions that bring together\nmany of the patterns discussed and illustrated in this book</p></li><p><br/>\nThe companion CD contains detailed illustrations for most of the\nrelevant patterns and two complete Java CAPS-based case studies\n(with solutions) that implement a number of the patterns discussed\nin the book. In addition, Part II contains a chapter on\ncryptographic objects used to configure security-related aspects of\nthe suite. It also provides more than sixty detailed examples\ndesigned to illustrate the concepts and patterns presented in this\nbook. Built with JCAPS eDesigner, these graphical, component-based\nexamples can easily be used by business analysts and others with or\nwithout strong coding skills.<br/><br/></p></span></span></span>",

We want to design highly usable and self-evident\napplications, but we also want to devise innovative, compelling,\nand exciting interactions that make waves in the market. Projects\nare more sophisticated than ever, but we have fewer resources with\nwhich to complete them. Requirements are fuzzy at best, but\nwe’re expected to have everything done yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we need is a reuse strategy, coupled with a pathway to\ninnovation. Patterns are part of the game. Components take us\nfurther. In <em>Web Anatomy: Interaction Design Frameworks That\nWork</em>, user experience experts Hoekman and Spool introduce\n“interaction design frameworks”, the third and final\npiece of what they call “The Reuse Trinity”, and\nresolve these issues once and for all. Frameworks are sets of\ndesign patterns and other elements that comprise entire systems,\nand in this game-changing book, Hoekman and Spool show you how to\nidentify, document, share, use, and reap the benefits of\nframeworks. They also dive deep into several major frameworks to\nreveal how the psychology behind these standards leads not only to\neffective designs, but can also serve as the basis for cutting-edge\ninnovations and superior user experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeb Anatomy delivers:<br/></p><li><p>A complete guide to using interaction design frameworks</p></li><li><p>An examination of the psychology behind major frameworks</p></li><li><p>A thorough look at how frameworks will change the way you work\nfor the better</p></li><p>Citing examples from both the successful and not-so-successful,\nthe authors break down the elements that comprise several common\ninteractive web systems, discuss implementation considerations,\noffer examples of innovations based on these standards, reveal how\nframeworks work hand in hand with patterns and components, and show\nyou how to integrate frameworks into your process.<br/>\n<br/>\nRead Web Anatomy now.

    "description": "<span>Map concepts and ideas in domain-driven design (DDD) and transpose them into clean, testable, and quality code that is effective alongside the Laravel framework. This book teaches you how to implement the concepts and patterns present in DDD in the real world as a complete web application. With these tactics and concepts in place, you'll engage in a variety of example applications, built from the ground up, and taken directly from real-world domains. <p>Begin by reviewing foundational stepping stones (with small, manageable examples to show proof of concepts as well as illustrations to conceptualize the more complex topics) of both DDD and Laravel. Specifically, such topics as entities, value objects, developing an ubiquitous language, DTOs, and knowledge discovery. Next, you will dive into some more advanced topics of DDD and use these concepts as a guide to make customizations to the default Laravel installation, giving you an understanding of why these alterations are vital to the DDD and Laravel platform. Finally, you will cover the very powerful Eloquent ORM that comes stock with Laravel and understand how it can be utilized to represent entities, handle repositories, and support domain events. </p><p>Although there is a basic coverage chapter and a setup tutorial for Laravel (along with a high level intro about the components used within it), <i>Domain-Driven Laravel</i> is best suited to readers who have been at least exposed to the framework and have had the opportunity to tinker around with it.</p><p><b>What You'll Learn</b></p>\n<p></p><ul><li>Utilize a blazing-fast rapid development pipeline built from DDD building blocks and facilitated with Laravel<br/></li><li>Implement value objects, repositories, entities, anti-corruption layers and others using Laravel as a web framework</li><li>Apply enhanced techniques for quick prototyping of complex requirements and quality results using an iterative and focused approach </li><li>Create a base framework (Laravel) that can serve as a template to start off any project</li><li>Gain insight on which details are important to a project’s success and how to acquire the necessary knowledge </li></ul><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>Ideal for for frontend/backend web developers, devops engineers, Laravel framework lovers and PHP developers hoping to learn more about either Domain Driven Design or the possibilities with the Laravel framework. Those with a working knowledge of plain PHP can also gain value from reading this book. </p></span>",

Dr. Kuncheva has plucked from the rich landscape of recent classifier ensemble literature the topics, methods, and algorithms that will guide the reader toward a deeper understanding of the fundamentals, design, and applications of classifier ensemble methods.</p><p>Thoroughly updated, with MATLAB code and practice data sets throughout, Combining Pattern Classifiers includes:</p><li><p>Coverage of Bayes decision theory and experimental comparison of classifiers</p></li><li><p>Essential ensemble methods such as Bagging, Random forest, AdaBoost, Random subspace, Rotation forest, Random oracle, and Error Correcting Output Code, among others</p></li><li><p>Chapters on classifier selection, diversity, and ensemble feature selection</p></li><p>With firm grounding in the fundamentals of pattern recognition, and featuring more than 140 illustrations, <em>Combining Pattern Classifiers, Second Edition</em> is a valuable reference for postgraduate students, researchers, and practitioners in computing and engineering.</p></span></span></span></span>",

It is a valuable\ncontribution to the literature in this area, and offers practical\nguidance for software architects and engineers.\"<br/>\n<b>—Alan Brown</b><br/>\nDistinguished Engineer, Rational Software, IBM Software Group</p><p>\"Gomaa's process and UML extensions allow development teams to\nfocus on feature-oriented development and provide a basis for\nimproving the level of reuse across multiple software development\nefforts. This book will be valuable to any software development\nprofessional who needs to manage across projects and wants to focus\non creating software that is consistent, reusable, and modular in\nnature.\"<br/>\n<b>—Jeffrey S Hammond</b><br/>\nGroup Marketing Manager, Rational Software, IBM Software Group</p><p>\"This book brings together a good range of concepts for\nunderstanding software product lines and provides an organized\nmethod for developing product lines using object-oriented\ntechniques with the UML. Once again, Hassan has done an excellent\njob in balancing the needs of both experienced and novice software\nengineers.\"<br/>\n<b>—Robert G. Pettit IV, Ph.D.</b><br/>\nAdjunct Professor of Software Engineering, George Mason\nUniversity</p><p>\"This breakthrough book provides a comprehensive step-by-step\napproach on how to develop software product lines, which is of\ngreat strategic benefit to industry. The development of software\nproduct lines enables significant reuse of software architectures.\nPractitioners will benefit from the well-defined PLUS process and\nrich case studies.\"<br/>\n<b>—Hurley V. Blankenship II</b><br/>\nProgram Manager, Justice and Public Safety, Science Applications\nInternational Corporation</p><p>\"The Product Line UML based Software engineering (PLUS) is\nleading edge. With the author's wide experience and deep knowledge,\nPLUS is well harmonized with architectural and design pattern\ntechnologies.\"<br/>\n<b>—Michael Shin</b><br/>\nAssistant Professor, Texas Tech University</p><p>Long a standard practice in traditional manufacturing, the\nconcept of product lines is quickly earning recognition in the\nsoftware industry. A software product line is a family of systems\nthat shares a common set of core technical assets with preplanned\nextensions and variations to address the needs of specific\ncustomers or market segments. When skillfully implemented, a\nproduct line strategy can yield enormous gains in productivity,\nquality, and time-to-market. Studies indicate that if three or more\nsystems with a degree of common functionality are to be developed,\na product-line approach is significantly more cost-effective.</p><p>To model and design families of systems, the analysis and design\nconcepts for single product systems need to be extended to support\nproduct lines. <b><em>Designing Software Product Lines with\nUML</em></b> shows how to employ the latest version of the\nindustry-standard Unified Modeling Language (UML 2.0) to reuse\nsoftware requirements and architectures rather than starting the\ndevelopment of each new system from scratch. Through real-world\ncase studies, the book illustrates the fundamental concepts and\ntechnologies used in the design and implementation of software\nproduct lines.</p><p>This book describes a new UML-based software design method for\nproduct lines called PLUS (Product Line UML-based Software\nengineering). PLUS provides a set of concepts and techniques to\nextend UML-based design methods and processes for single systems in\na new dimension to address software product lines. Using PLUS, the\nobjective is to explicitly model the commonality and variability in\na software product line.</p><p>Hassan Gomaa explores how each of the UML modeling\nviews—use case, static, state machine, and interaction\nmodeling—can be extended to address software product\nfamilies. He also discusses how software architectural patterns can\nbe used to develop a reusable component-based architecture for a\nproduct line and how to express this architecture as a UML\nplatform-independent model that can then be mapped to a\nplatform-specific model.</p><p>Key topics include:</p><li><p>Software product line engineering process, which extends the\nUnified Development Software Process to address software product\nlines</p></li><li><p>Use case modeling, including modeling the common and variable\nfunctionality of a product line</p></li><li><p>Incorporating feature modeling into UML for modeling common,\noptional, and alternative product line features</p></li><li><p>Static modeling, including modeling the boundary of the product\nline and information-intensive entity classes</p></li><li><p>Dynamic modeling, including using interaction modeling to\naddress use-case variability</p></li><li><p>State machines for modeling state-dependent variability</p></li><li><p>Modeling class variability using inheritance and\nparameterization</p></li><li><p>Software architectural patterns for product lines</p></li><li><p>Component-based distributed design using the new UML 2.0\ncapability for modeling components, connectors, ports, and provided\nand required interfaces</p></li><li><p>Detailed case studies giving a step-by-step solution to\nreal-world product line problems</p></li><p><b><em>Designing Software Product Lines with UML</em></b> is an\ninvaluable resource for all designers and developers in this\ngrowing field. The information, technology, and case studies\npresented here show how to harness the promise of software product\nlines and the practicality of the UML to take software design,\nquality, and efficiency to the next level.
