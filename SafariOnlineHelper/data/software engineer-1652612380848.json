    "title": "Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams, Third Edition",
    "description": "<span><p>Few books in computing have had as profound an influence on software management as <i><b>Peopleware</b></i>. The unique insight of this longtime best seller is that the major issues of software development are human, not technical. They’re not easy issues; but solve them, and you’ll maximize your chances of success.</p><p> </p><p>“<b>Peopleware </b>has long been one of my two favorite books on software engineering. Its underlying strength is its base of immense real experience, much of it quantified. Many, many varied projects have been reflected on and distilled; but what we are given is not just lifeless distillate, but vivid examples from which we share the authors’ inductions. Their premise is right: most software project problems are sociological, not technological. The insights on team jelling and work environment have changed my thinking and teaching. The third edition adds strength to strength.” </p><p>— Frederick P. Brooks, Jr., Kenan Professor of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Author of The Mythical Man-Month and The Design of Design</p><p> </p><p>“<b>Peopleware </b>is the one book that everyone who runs a software team needs to read and reread once a year. In the quarter century since the first edition appeared, it has become more important, not less, to think about the social and human issues in software development. This is the only way we’re going to make more humane, productive workplaces. Buy it, read it, and keep a stock on hand in the office supply closet.” </p><p>—Joel Spolsky, Co-founder, Stack Overflow</p><p> </p><p>“When a book about a field as volatile as software design and use extends to a third edition, you can be sure that the authors write of deep principle, of the fundamental causes for what we readers experience, and not of the surface that everyone recognizes. And to bring people, actual human beings, into the mix! How excellent. How rare. The authors have made this third edition, with its additions, entirely terrific.” </p><p>—Lee Devin and Rob Austin, Co-authors of The Soul of Design and Artful Making</p><p> </p><p>For this third edition, the authors have added six new chapters and updated the text throughout, bringing it in line with today’s development environments and challenges. For example, the book now discusses pathologies of leadership that hadn’t previously been judged to be pathological; an evolving culture of meetings; hybrid teams made up of people from seemingly incompatible generations; and a growing awareness that some of our most common tools are more like anchors than propellers. Anyone who needs to manage a software project or software organization will find invaluable advice throughout the book.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><h3>Praise for <em>Agile Estimating and Planning</em></h3><p>“Traditional, deterministic approaches to planning and estimating simply don’t cut it on the slippery slopes of today’s dynamic, change-driven projects. Mike Cohn’s breakthrough book gives us not only the philosophy, but also the guidelines and a proven set of tools that we need to succeed in planning, estimating, and scheduling projects with a high uncertainty factor. At the same time, the author never loses sight of the need to deliver business value to the customer each step of the way.”</p><p>—Doug DeCarlo, author of <em>eXtreme Project Management: Using Leadership, Principles and Tools to Deliver Value in the Face of Volatility</em> (Jossey-Bass, 2004)</p><p>“We know how to build predictive plans and manage them. But building plans that only estimate the future and then embrace change, challenge most of our training and skills. In <em><strong>Agile Estimating and Planning</strong></em>, Mike Cohn once again fills a hole in the Agile practices, this time by showing us a workable approach to Agile estimating and planning. Mike delves into the nooks and crannies of the subject and anticipates many of the questions and nuances of this topic. Students of Agile processes will recognize that this book is truly about agility, bridging many of the practices between Scrum and ExtremeProgramming.”</p><p>—Ken Schwaber, Scrum evangelist, Agile Alliance cofounder, and signatory to the Agile Manifesto</p><p>“In <strong><em>Agile Estimating and Planning</em></strong>, Mike Cohn has, for the first time, brought together most everything that the Agile community has learned about the subject. The book is clear, well organized, and a pleasant and valuable read. It goes into all the necessary detail, and at the same time keeps the reader’s burden low. We can dig in as deeply as we need to, without too much detail before we need it. The book really brings together everything we have learned about Agile estimation and planning over the past decade. It will serve its readers well.”</p><p>—Ron Jeffries, www.XProgramming.com, author of <em>Extreme Programming Installed</em> (Addison-Wesley, 2001) and <em>Extreme Programming Adventures in C#</em> (Microsoft Press, 2004)</p><p>“<em><strong>Agile Estimating and Planning</strong></em> provides a view of planning that’s balanced between theory and practice, and it is supported by enough concrete experiences to lend it credibility. I particularly like the quote ’planning is a quest for value.’ It points to a new, more positive attitude toward planning that goes beyond the ’necessary evil’ view that I sometimes hold.”</p><p>—Kent Beck, author of <em>Extreme Programming Explained, Second Edition</em> (Addison-Wesley, 2005)</p><p>“Up-front planning is still the most critical part of software development. Agile software development requires Agile planning techniques. This book shows you how to employ Agile planning in a succinct, practical, and easy-to-follow manner.”</p><p>—Adam Rogers, Ultimate Software</p><p>“Mike does a great follow-up to <em>User Stories Applied</em> by continuing to provide Agile teams with the practical approaches and techniques to increase agility. In this book, Mike provides time-proven and well-tested methods for being successful with the multiple levels of planning and estimating required by Agile. This book is the first to detail the disciplines of Agile estimating and planning, in ways that rival my 1980 civil engineering texts on CPM Planning and Estimating.”</p><p>—Ryan Martens, President and Founder, Rally Software Development Corporation</p><p>“With insight and clarity, Mike Cohn shows how to effectively produce software of high business value. With Agile estimation and planning, you focus effort where it really counts, and continue to do so as circumstances change.”</p><p>—Rick Mugridge, Rimu Research Ltd., and lead author, <em>Fit for Developing Software</em> (Prentice Hall, 2005)</p><p>“Finally! The groundbreaking book my clients have been clamoring for! <em><strong>Agile Estimating and Planning</strong></em> demystifies the process of defining, driving, and delivering great software that matters to the business. Mike’s clarity, insight, and experience leap out through every page of this book, offering an approach that is relevant and immediately useful to all members of an Agile project.”</p><p>—Kert D. Peterson, President, Enterprise Agile Group, LLC</p><p>“This isn’t yet another generic book on Agile software development. <strong><em>Agile Estimating and Planning</em></strong> fills a gap left by most of the other books and gives you important, practical, down-to-earth techniques needed to be successful on Agile development projects.”</p><p>—Steve Tockey, Principal Consultant, Construx Software</p><p>“Estimation, planning, and tracking is a trinity. If you don’t do one of them, you don’t need the other two. This book provides very practical knowledge for estimation, planning, prioritizing, and tracking. It should be compulsory subject matter for project managers and their teams, even if they hesitate to call themselves Agile.”</p><p>—Niels Malotaux, Project Coach</p><p>“Effective planning is an important, but often misunderstood, part of any successful Agile project. With <em><strong>Agile Estimating and Planning</strong></em>, Mike Cohn has given us a definitive guide to a wide range of Agile estimating and planning practices. With his clear and practical style, Mike not only explains how to successfully get started planning an Agile project, but also provides a wealth of tips and advice for improving any team’s Agile planning process. This book is a must-read for managers, coaches, and members of Agile teams.”</p><p>—Paul Hodgetts, Agile coach and CEO, Agile Logic</p><p>“Mike’s writing style captures the essence of agility-just the right amount of information to bring clarity to the reader. This book provides an excellent guide for all Agile practitioners, both seasoned and novice.”</p><p>—Robert Holler, President and CEO, VersionOne, LLC</p><p>“It is as if Mike took the distilled knowledge regarding planning and estimation of a great Agile developer (which he is) and laid out all he knows in an easily understandable manner. More importantly, he has a great mix of concepts with real-world examples finished off with a case study so the reader can relate the information to their own situation. Unless you are already an expert Agile planner and estimator, this book is for you.”</p><p>—Alan Shalloway, CEO, Senior Consultant, Net Objectives, and coauthor of <em>Design Patterns Explained, Second Edition</em> (Addison-Wesley, 2005)</p><p>“Although I had plenty of XP experience before trying out Mike Cohn’s Agile planning practices, the effectiveness of the practical and proven techniques in this book blew me away! The book recognizes that people, not tools or processes, produce great software, and that teams benefit most by learning about their project and their product as they go. The examples in the book are concrete, easily grasped, and simply reek of common sense. This book will help teams (whether Agile or not) deliver more value, more often, and have fun doing it! Whether you’re a manager or a programmer, a tester or a CEO, part of an Agile team, or just looking for a way to stamp out chaos and death marches, this book will guide you.”</p><p>—Lisa Crispin, coauthor of <em>Testing Extreme Programming</em> (Addison-Wesley, 2003)</p><p>“Mike Cohn does an excellent job demonstrating how an Agile approach can address issues of risk and uncertainty in order to provide more meaningful estimates and plans for software projects.”</p><p>—Todd Little, Senior Development Manager, Landmark Graphics</p><p>“Mike Cohn explains his approach to Agile planning, and shows how ’critical chain’ thinking can be used to effectively buffer both schedule and features. As with <em>User Stories Applied</em>, this book is easy to read and grounded in real-world experience.”</p><p>—Bill Wake, author of <em>Refactoring Workbook</em> (Addison-Wesley, 2003)</p><p>“Mike brings this book to life with real-world examples that help reveal how and why an Agile approach works for planning software development projects. This book has great breadth, ranging from the fundamentals of release planning to advanced topics such as financial aspects of prioritization. I can see this book becoming an invaluable aid to Agile project managers, as it provides a wealth of practical tips such as how to set iteration length and boot-strap velocity, and communicate progress.”</p><p>—Rachel Davies, Independent Consultant</p><p>“There has been a need for a solid, pragmatic book on the long-term vision of an Agile Project for project managers. <em><strong>Agile Estimating and Planning</strong></em> addresses this need. It’s not theory—this book contains project-tested practices that have been used on Agile projects. As Mike’s test subjects, we applied these practices to the development of video games (one of the most unpredictable project environments you can imagine) with success.”</p><p>—Clinton Keith, Chief Technical Officer, High Moon Studios</p><p>“When I first heard Mike Cohn speak, I was impressed by a rare combination of qualities: deep experience and understanding in modern iterative and Agile methods; a drive to find and validate easy, high-impact solutions beyond the status quo of traditional (usually ineffective) methods; and the passion and clarity of a natural coach. These qualities are evident in this wonderful, practical guide. I estimate you won’t be disappointed in studying and applying his advice.”</p><p>—Craig Larman, Chief Scientist, Valtech, and author of <em>Applying UML and Patterns, Third Edition</em> (Prentice Hall, 2005) and <em>Agile and Iterative Development</em> (Addison-Wesley, 2004)</p><p>“<em><strong>Agile Estimating and Planning</strong></em> is a critical guide on how to successfully provide value to customers of IT services. This book is filled with clear examples that are essential—from project team members to the executive level.”</p><p>—Lou Thomas, Director, Applications Development, Farm Credit Services of America</p><p>“This work is deeply significant in that it articulates and details structured techniques to realize a simple, but profound insight—planning is an iterative quest for value, rather than a perfunctory scheduling of activities. Mike presents processes to converge on this value while reducing risk and uncertainty, supporting decision making, establishing trust, and conveying information. Agile methodologies have shifted the emphasis from plans to planning, but have glossed over many of the finer details of Agile planning. Now, very simply and accessibly, Mike demonstrates how it can be done.”</p><p>—Sanjiv Augustine, Practice Director, Lean-Agile Consulting at CC Pace, and author of <em>Managing Agile Projects</em> (Prentice Hall, 2005)</p><p>“The techniques described in <em><strong>Agile Estimating and Planning</strong></em> have helped us tremendously with planning and managing our projects. It provides all you have ever wanted to know about Agile project management.”</p><p>—Roman Pichler, Engineering Manager, Siemens Communications</p><p>“Mike Cohn presents a highly pragmatic and logical approach to making projects successful in a world beset by uncertainty and change. With his trademark clarity and directness, Mike cuts through the management mumbo jumbo to present practical techniques that can be put into use immediately. Put the odds squarely in your favor by making Mike Cohn the planning guru on your next big project.”</p><p>—Pete Deemer, Vice President, Product Development, Yahoo!</p><p>“This book distills the fundamental ideas behind Agile estimating and planning, presenting them in a thoughtful and approachable manner. This is a ’must-have’ book that presents clear, unambiguous, and practical advice for anyone who wants to successfully manage modern software development projects.”</p><p>—Scott W. Ambler, President, Ambysoft Inc.</p><p>“How do your projects go? Frustrating changes? Uncertainty? Product missing both the mark and the deadline? With insight and clarity, Mike Cohn shows how to effectively produce software that is of high business value. With agile estimation and planning, you focus effort where it really counts, and continue to do so as circumstances change.”</p><p>—Rick Mugridge, Rimu Research Ltd., and lead author of <em>Fit for Developing Software</em></p><p>“We are true believers in the agile methods described in this book, and have experienced a substantially positive impact from their implementation and continued use. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in making their software development more practical and effective.”</p><p>—Mark M. Gutrich, President and CEO, Fast 401k, Inc.</p><h3>Detailed, Proven Techniques for Estimating and Planning Any Agile Project</h3><p><em><strong>Agile Estimating and Planning</strong></em> is the definitive, practical guide to estimating and planning agile projects.

    "description": "<span><div><p><strong>Right Your Software and Transform Your Career</strong></p><p><em><strong>Righting Software</strong></em> presents the proven, structured, and highly engineered approach to software design that renowned architect Juval Löwy has practiced and taught around the world. Although companies of every kind have successfully implemented his original design ideas across hundreds of systems, these insights have never before appeared in print.</p><p>Based on first principles in software engineering and a comprehensive set of matching tools and techniques, Löwy’s methodology integrates system design and project design. First, he describes the primary area where many software architects fail and shows how to decompose a system into smaller building blocks or services, based on volatility. Next, he shows how to flow an effective project design from the system design; how to accurately calculate the project duration, cost, and risk; and how to devise multiple execution options.</p><p>The method and principles in <em><strong>Righting Software</strong></em> apply regardless of your project and company size, technology, platform, or industry. Löwy starts the reader on a journey that addresses the critical challenges of software development today by righting software systems and projects as well as careers–and possibly the software industry as a whole. Software professionals, architects, project leads, or managers at any stage of their career will benefit greatly from this book, which provides guidance and knowledge that would otherwise take decades and many projects to acquire.</p><p><em>Register your book for convenient access to downloads, updates, and/or corrections as they become available.

    "description": "<span><div><p>This 25th anniversary edition of Steven Levy's classic book traces the exploits of the computer revolution's original hackers -- those brilliant and eccentric nerds from the late 1950s through the early '80s who took risks, bent the rules, and pushed the world in a radical new direction. With updated material from noteworthy hackers such as Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Richard Stallman, and Steve Wozniak, <i>Hackers</i> is a fascinating story that begins in early computer research labs and leads to the first home computers.</p><p>Levy profiles the imaginative brainiacs who found clever and unorthodox solutions to computer engineering problems. They had a shared sense of values, known as \"the hacker ethic,\" that still thrives today. <i>Hackers</i> captures a seminal period in recent history when underground activities blazed a trail for today's digital world, from MIT students finagling access to clunky computer-card machines to the DIY culture that spawned the Altair and the Apple II.</p></div></span>",

We then look at the requirements\n(quality attributes) that drive architecture-things like\nperformance, modifiability, security, and so forth. We learn how to\nelicit, prioritize, and characterize these quality attributes\nprecisely and unambiguously. Then we will talk about the\nbuilding-blocks of architecture: patterns and tactics. Using this\nknowledge we will go over a method for architecture design called\nADD (Attribute Driven Design). Having designed (or inherited) an\narchitecture, you may want to analyze it, to understand its\nstrengths and weaknesses. To achieve this we present a method\ncalled the ATAM (Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method). Finally we\nfinish up with some practical advice for practicing architects such\nas: how to blend architect activities with agile methodologies, and\nhow to be an agent for change in an organization.</p><p><b>Skill Level</b></p><ul><li>Intermediate</li><li>Advanced</li></ul><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>What is Software Architecture</li><li>Architectural Requirements: Quality Attributes</li><li>Architectural Patterns and Tactics</li><li>Architecture Design</li><li>Architecture Analysis</li><li>Architecture in Agile Projects</li></ul><p><b>Who Should Take This Course</b></p><ul><li>Developers looking \"go to the next level\" in their organization\nand become architects and leaders.</li></ul><p><b>Course Requirements</b></p><ul><li>Basic understanding of programming and development</li><li>Basic understanding of the software engineering lifecycle and\nproject activities</li></ul><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><p><b>Lesson 1: Course Intro/What is Software Architecture</b></p><p><p>1.1 Define software architecture \n<br/>1.2 Explain why software architecture is important\n<br/>1.3 Document an architecture\n<br/>1.4 Understand the importance of architectural patterns and\nreference architectures\n<br/>1.5 Distinguish a good architecture</p></p><p><b>Lesson 2: Architecture Requirements: Quality Attributes</b></p><p><p>2.1 Distinguish functionality from Quality Attributes (QAs)\n<br/>2.2 Specify quality attribute requirements\n<br/>2.3 Recognize other requirements that drive an\narchitecture</p></p><p><b>Lesson 3: Gathering Architectural Requirements</b></p><p><p>3.1 Identify problems in eliciting actionable architectural\nrequirements\n<br/>3.2 Use the Quality Attribute Workshop (QAW)\n<br/>3.3 Use the Quality Attribute Utility Tree</p></p><p><b>Lesson 4: Architectural Patterns and Tactics</b></p><p><p>4.1 Use architectural patterns\n<br/>4.2 Use architectural tactics\n<br/>4.3 Understand how tactics interact with patterns</p></p><p><b>Lesson 5: Creating the Architecture Tactics</b></p><p><p>5.1 Design an architecture\n<br/>5.2 Understand a model design problem\n<br/>5.3 Follow the steps of ADD</p></p><p><b>Lesson 6: Architecture Evaluation</b></p><p><p>6.1 Understand the forms of arcitecture evaluation\n<br/>6.2 Follow the steps of the ATAM\n<br/>6.3 Use thelLightweight ATAM</p></p><p><b>Lesson 7: Architectures in Agile Projects</b></p><p><p>7.1 Understand the concepts of Agile \n<br/>7.2 See the relationship between agility and architecture\n<br/>7.3 Follow guidelines for Agile architects</p></p><p><b>Lesson 8: Epilogue</b></p><p><p>8.1 The Value of Architecture</p></p><p><b>Summary</b></p><p> </p><p><b>About LiveLessons Video Training</b><b><br/></b>LiveLessons Video Training series publishes hundreds of\nhands-on, expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of\ntechnology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to\nsucceed.

    "description": "<span><span><p><strong>Overview</strong></p><p>Configuration of Cisco devices (e.g. routers and switches) has traditionally been performed at the command line. However, an industry-wide paradigm shift is now underway, where more and more configuration is being performed by software, an approach commonly referred to as Software Defined Networking (SDN). SDN is an emerging architecture that is makes it easier and more cost-effective to implement network policies and manage network resources. It does this by decoupling the network control from the network hardware (which continues to manage forwarding functions), allowing network control to become directly programmable and the underlying network infrastructure to be managed by applications and network services rather than individually configured.</p><p>Network Programmability Fundamentals LiveLessons introduces the theory surrounding SDN networks and examines components found in a Cisco ACI network. Additionally, this course covers Python programming, a key skill required for network programmability. Finally, this course walks through multiple network programmability exercises, which can be performed (for free) at Cisco’s DevNet site.</p><p><strong>About the Instructor</strong></p><p>With Cisco experience dating back to 1989, Kevin Wallace, CCIEx2 (Collaboration and R/S) #7945 has been a network design specialist for the Walt Disney World Resort, an instructor of Cisco courses for Skillsoft, and a network manager for Eastern Kentucky University. Kevin currently produces video courses and writes books for Cisco Press/Pearson IT Certification (http://kwtrain.com/books), and he lives in central Kentucky with his wife (Vivian) and two daughters (Stacie and Sabrina).</p><p><strong>Skill Level</strong></p><p><strong> Beginner to Intermediate</strong></p><p><strong>Learn How To</strong></p><ul><li>Update your skill set by developing SDN skills</li><li>Work with basic network programmability tools and technologies</li><li>Understand the basics of Python programming to develop network automation applications</li><li>Automate enterprise network operations with APIC-EM</li><li>Automate data center network operations with APIC</li><li>Configure telnet, SSH, and NETCONF</li></ul><p><strong>Who Should Take This Course</strong></p><p>This video is targeted at a broad range of network engineers, including those who are just starting in the networking industry to seasoned professionals who would like to expand their knowledge of the technologies and principles behind network programmability.

In each essay, contributors present a notable software architecture, and analyze what makes it innovative and ideal for its purpose. <br/><br/>Some of the engineers in this book reveal how they developed a specific project, including decisions they faced and tradeoffs they made. Others take a step back to investigate how certain architectural aspects have influenced computing as a whole. With this book, you'll discover:</p><p/><ul><li>How Facebook's architecture is the basis for a data-centric application ecosystem</li><li>The effect of Xen's well-designed architecture on the way operating systems evolve</li><li>How community processes within the KDE project help software architectures evolve from rough sketches to beautiful systems</li><li>How creeping featurism has helped GNU Emacs gain unanticipated functionality</li><li>The magic behind the Jikes RVM self-optimizable, self-hosting runtime</li><li>Design choices and building blocks that made Tandem the choice platform in high-availability environments for over two decades</li><li>Differences and similarities between object-oriented and functional architectural views</li><li>How architectures can affect the software's evolution and the developers' engagement</li></ul><p>Go behind the scenes to learn what it takes to design elegant software architecture, and how it can shape the way you approach your own projects, with <em>Beautiful Architecture</em>.</p></div></span>",

This brand-new text covers all facets of software architecture and how it serves as the intellectual centerpiece of software development and evolution. Critically, this text focuses on supporting creation of real implemented systems. Hence the text details not only modeling techniques, but design, implementation, deployment, and system adaptation -- as well as a host of other topics -- putting the elements in context and comparing and contrasting them with one another. Rather than focusing on one method, notation, tool, or process, this new text/reference widely surveys software architecture techniques, enabling the instructor and practitioner to choose the right tool for the job at hand. Software Architecture is intended for upper-division undergraduate and graduate courses in software architecture, software design, component-based software engineering, and distributed systems; the text may also be used in introductory as well as advanced software engineering courses.</p></span></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p/><div><p>\"The computer world is like an intellectual Wild West, in which you can shoot anyone you wish with your ideas, if you're willing to risk the consequences. \" --from <i>Hackers &amp; Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age</i>, by Paul Graham</p><p>We are living in the computer age, in a world increasingly designed and engineered by computer programmers and software designers, by people who call themselves hackers. Who are these people, what motivates them, and why should you care?</p><p>Consider these facts: Everything around us is turning into computers. Your typewriter is gone, replaced by a computer. Your phone has turned into a computer. So has your camera. Soon your TV will. Your car was not only designed on computers, but has more processing power in it than a room-sized mainframe did in 1970. Letters, encyclopedias, newspapers, and even your local store are being replaced by the Internet.</p><p><i>Hackers &amp; Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age</i>, by Paul Graham, explains this world and the motivations of the people who occupy it. In clear, thoughtful prose that draws on illuminating historical examples, Graham takes readers on an unflinching exploration into what he calls \"an intellectual Wild West.\"</p><p>The ideas discussed in this book will have a powerful and lasting impact on how we think, how we work, how we develop technology, and how we live. Topics include the importance of beauty in software design, how to make wealth, heresy and free speech, the programming language renaissance, the open-source movement, digital design, internet startups, and more.</p></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><div><p>Technical debt is a funny thing. While the term attempts to make an analogy with financial debt, technical debt and financial debt have nothing in common. Instead, it’s the name we give engineering decisions we disagree with.</p><p>Robert \"r0ml\" Lefkowitz (Retired) offers an overview of technical debt, explaining how to recognize it, how to prevent or reduce it, and how come we see so much of it. Many so-called best practices today, are, in fact, technical debt factories. The reason we have so much of it is that we eagerly create it at earlier stages of an organization and fail to alter our approaches soon enough when the organization matures, and these early practices which were “investment” become “debt.” Robert discusses many of these practices.</p><p>One of these is microservices—often undertaken as a technique for increasing agility, at the cost of manufacturing tech debt. Robert details common methods for avoiding increasing the tech debt burden by deploying microservices.</p><p>Robert explores two primary themes that apply to multiple software methods. The first is the principle of parsimony, which dates back to the ancient Greeks but was popularized more recently by the 12th century theologian William of Ockham. The second theme is the doctrine of immutability. This idea, too, flowered during the Middle Ages and is enjoying a renaissance today with the rise of functional programming languages. Robert dives into both of these ideas as they apply to data types, programming languages, network protocols, software dependencies, configuration management, and more.</p><p>This session was recorded at the 2019 O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference in New York.</p></div></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p><em>Software Development and Professional Practice</em> reveals how to design and code great software. What factors do you take into account? What makes a good design? What methods and processes are out there for designing software? Is designing small programs different than designing large ones? How can you tell a good design from a bad one? You'll learn the principles of good software design, and how to turn those principles back into great code.</p><p><em>Software Development and Professional Practice</em> is also about code construction—how to write great programs and make them work. What, you say? You've already written eight gazillion programs! Of course I know how to write code! Well, in this book you'll re-examine what you already do, and you'll investigate ways to improve. Using the Java language, you'll look deeply into coding standards, debugging, unit testing, modularity, and other characteristics of good programs. You'll also talk about reading code. How do you read code? What makes a program readable? Can good, readable code replace documentation? How much documentation do you really need?</p><p>This book introduces you to software engineering—the application of engineering principles to the development of software. What are these engineering principles? First, all engineering efforts follow a defined process. So, you'll be spending a bit of time talking about how you run a software development project and the different phases of a project. Secondly, all engineering work has a basis in the application of science and mathematics to real-world problems. And so does software development! You'll therefore take the time to examine how to design and implement programs that solve specific problems.</p><p>Finally, this book is also about human-computer interaction and user interface design issues. A poor user interface can ruin any desire to actually use a program; in this book, you'll figure out why and how to avoid those errors.</p><p><em>Software Development and Professional Practice</em> covers many of the topics described for the ACM Computing Curricula 2001 course C292c Software Development and Professional Practice. It is designed to be both a textbook and a manual for the working professional.</p><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><ul><li><p>How to design and code great software</p></li><li><p>What methods and processes are available to help you design great software</p></li><li><p>How to apply software engineering principles to your daily coding practice</p></li><li><p>How to tell a good design from a bad one?</p></li><li><p>Understand the characteristics of good programs</p></li><li><p>How to construct professional standard code that you can be proud to show</p></li><li><p>Understand all about coding standards, and apply them to real Java coding</p></li><li><p>Explore debugging, unit testing and modularity</p></li><li><p>All about object-oriented programming (OOP) design principles and great coding</p></li><li><p>How to apply the principles you've learned to specific and real-world coding problems</p></li><li><p>A companion to the ACM Computing Curricular 2001 source C202c</p></li></ul><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p><em>Software Development and Professional Practice</em> is designed to be both a textbook and a manual for the working professional programmer, and any student of programming who wants to learn the art of the trade.

It is designed to be used in conjunction with code provided on an online repository. The book complements and explains the raw code in a way that is accessible to anyone who regularly practices the art of programming. The book can also be used in advanced programming courses in computer science and software engineering programs.</p><p/><p>The book contains 33 different styles for writing the term frequency task. The styles are grouped into nine categories: historical, basic, function composition, objects and object interactions, reflection and metaprogramming, adversity, data-centric, concurrency, and interactivity. The author verbalizes the constraints in each style and explains the example programs. Each chapter first presents the constraints of the style, next shows an example program, and then gives a detailed explanation of the code. Most chapters also have sections focusing on the use of the style in systems design as well as sections describing the historical context in which the programming style emerged. </p></span></span></span></span></span></span>",

This guide will help technologists update their architecture practice for new software challenges.</p><p>As part of the Vaughn Vernon Signature Series, this title was hand-selected for the practical, delivery-oriented knowledge that architects and software engineers can quickly apply. It includes in-depth guidance for addressing today's key quality attributes and cross-cutting concerns such as security, performance, scalability, resilience, data, and emerging technologies. Each key technique is demonstrated through a start-to-finish case study reflecting the authors deep experience with complex software environments. Key topics include:</p><ul><li><p>Creating sustainable, coherent systems that meet functional requirements and the quality attributes stakeholders care about</p></li><li><p>Understanding team-based software architecture and architecture as a “flow of decisions”</p></li><li><p>Understanding crucial issues of data management, integration, and change, and the impact of varied data technologies on architecture</p></li><li><p>Architecting for security, including continuous threat modeling and mitigation</p></li><li><p>Architecting for scalability and resilience, including scaling microservices and serverless environments</p></li><li><p>Using architecture to improve performance in continuous delivery environments</p></li><li><p>Using architecture to apply emerging technologies successfully</p></li></ul><p><em>Register your book for convenient access to downloads, updates, and/or corrections as they become available.

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>Google arguably maintains one of the largest codebases ever, and the expected lifespan of the codebase is at least another couple of decades. It’s no surprise then that the company has learned many lessons related to the sustainability of software as it’s figured out how to operate at a scale previously unattempted for a timespan longer than most others have considered. Learning from the difficulties that they encountered while wrangling with this unprecedented problem, Google’s software engineers have tailored their practices to factor in time, scaling, and evidence-based decision making.</p><p>In this Meet the Expert with Titus Winters, learn the practices, policies, and decisions Google has implemented to support robust and reliable code. You’ll explore the themes of time and scale in the context of sustainable software engineering—and discover the impact (and trade-offs) that each of these factors has on the process of software development and maintenance. You’ll also see how Google has shaped its engineering practices to take these principles into account.</p><p>Recorded on August 3, 2020.

    "description": "<span><span><p><b>Getting Architecture Just Right: Detailed Practical Guidance\nfor Architecting Any Real-World IT Project</b><br/><br/>\nTo build effective architectures, software architects must tread a\nfine line between precision and ambiguity (a.k.a. big animal\npictures). This is difficult but crucial: Failure to achieve this\nbalance often leads directly to poor systems design and\nimplementation. Now, pioneering IBM Distinguished Engineer and\nChief Technology Officer Tilak Mitra offers the first complete\nguide to developing end-to-end solution architectures that are\n“just enough”--identifying and capturing the most\nimportant artifacts, without over-engineering or excessive\ndocumentation, and providing a practical approach to consistent and\nrepeated success in defining software architectures.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Practical Software Architecture</em> provides detailed\nprescriptive and pragmatic guidance for architecting any real-world\nIT project, regardless of system, methodology, or environment.\nMitra specifically identifies the artifacts that require emphasis\nand shows how to communicate evolving solutions with stakeholders,\nbridging the gap between architecture and implementation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThrough a real-world case study, Mitra guides you iteratively\nthrough building an end-to-end solution architecture. Step by step,\nhe addresses key topics in developing system contexts, architecture\noverviews, architecture decisions, functional models, operational\nmodels, integration patterns for systems design, infrastructure\nmatters, and more. Throughout, you’ll find clear, crisp, and\naccurate guidance for crafting architectures that can be\nconfidently delivered on time and budget.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Coverage Includes</b><br/></p><li><p>Using architecture to promote communication, enable planning,\nand support functional as well as nonfunctional capabilities (such\nas scalability, performance, maintainability, and security)</p></li><li><p>Focusing on the architectural problem at hand and avoiding\noverreliance on theory and generalization</p></li><li><p>An architectural introduction to analytics</p></li><li><p>Capturing “just enough” about system context,\narchitecture overview, architecture decisions, functional models,\nand operational models</p></li><li><p>Integration patterns and their usage in architecture\ndesign</p></li><li><p>Infrastructure matters in any software architecture</p></li><li><p>A real-world case study and its software architecture</p></li></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p><b>Praise for <em>Beyond Software Architecture</em></b></p><p>“Luke Hohmann is that rare software technologist who views\nsoftware development from the viewpoint of the end user. He\npassionately believes that one hour spent with an end user is worth\nmany hours making software architectural choices or days\ndocumenting perceived user requirements. Most of what is written\nabout software development focuses on methods used to design and\ndevelop robust software. Luke’s latest effort, <em>Beyond\nSoftware Architecture</em>, illuminates the more mundane aspects of\ncreating true business solutions by supporting the user throughout\nthe lifecycle of the software product. By concerning himself with\ncreating business value, Luke tightens the connection between a\nsoftware application and the business function it\nperforms.”</p><p>\n         &amp;#8212<b>Bruce\nBourbon</b><br/>\n             General\nPartner, Telos Venture Partners</p><p>“There are two kinds of people that read the Dilbert comic\nstrip: folks that take a moment to marvel at how accurately it\nreflects life at their company before moving on to the next comic\nstrip, and folks that think Dilbert is an amusing reminder that\nhigh tech companies can and should be better than Dilbert’s\nworld. Anyone in the first group should stick to reading comics.\nThis book is for people in the latter group.”</p><p>\n         —<b>Tony\nNavarrete</b><br/>\n             Vice\nPresident, Diamondhead Ventures</p><p>“Luke brings a proven methodology to the challenge of\nsoftware development. In <em>Beyond Software Architecture</em>, Luke\nprovides practical and proven techniques that all development\nexecutives can employ to improve the productivity of their software\norganization.”</p><p>\n         —<b>G.\nBradford Solso</b><br/>\n             CEO,\nTaviz Technology</p><p>“<em>Beyond Software Architecture</em> is the first book I\nhave read which contains an insider’s perspective of both the\nbusiness and technical facets of software architecture. This is a\ngreat book to get marketers and software managers on the same\npage!”</p><p>\n         &amp;#8212<b>Damon\nSchechter</b><br/>\n             CEO,\nLOC Global<br/>\n             author\nof <em>Delivering the Goods</em></p><p>“There are books on technical architecture and books on\nproduct marketing, but few, if any, on how architecture and\nmarketing information must be integrated for world class product\ndevelopment. <em>Beyond Software Architecture</em> provides this\nvaluable bridge between technology and marketing&amp;#8212it\nexplains how to deliver quality products that are profitable in the\nmarketplace.”</p><p>\n         &amp;#8212<b>Jim\nHighsmith</b><br/>\n             Director,\nCutter Consortium<br/>\n             author\nof <em>Adaptive Software Development</em></p><p>“Product development managers, marketing managers,\narchitects, and technical leads from all functions should read this\nbook. You’ll see a pragmatic view of how to define and use a\nproduct architecture throughout a project’s lifecycle and a\nproduct's lifetime.”</p><p>\n         &amp;#8212<b>Johanna\nRothman</b><br/>\n             Rothman\nConsulting Group, Inc.</p><p>“Luke Hohmann has captured the essence of product creation\nin his latest book. He cleverly discusses the need for both the\nmarketing and engineering roles in product creation and ties the\ntwo together building a good foundation for understanding and\nexecuting successful product creation.”</p><p>\n         &amp;#8212<b>Lee\nSigler</b><br/>\n             Principal,\n360 Market View, Inc.</p><p>“Finally a book that deals with those often ignored but\ncritical operational issues like licensing, deployment,\ninstallation, configuration and support. <em>Beyond Software\nArchitecture</em> is the “What they don't teach you at Harvard\nBusiness School” book for anyone who develops software\nproducts&amp;#8212or buys them.”</p><p>\n         &amp;#8212<b>Mary\nPoppendieck</b><br/>\n             Managing\nDirector, Agile Alliance<br/>\n             President,\nPoppendieck LLC</p><p>“Luke Hohmann delivers a passionate, articulate wake-up\ncall to software architects: it ain’t just technical any\nmore! Technical architectures have profound business ramifications,\nand ignoring the business ramifications of portability, usability,\nconfiguration, upgrade and release management, security, and other\narchitectural choices can not only lead to project failures, but\nultimately to nasty lawsuits from disappointed customers. <em>Beyond\nSoftware Architecture</em> is a must-read for successful software\nproduct managers!”</p><p>\n         &amp;#8212<b>Ed\nYourdon</b><br/>\n             Author\nof numerous books and articles on software development</p><p>“<em>Beyond Software Architecture</em> is not just for\nsoftware engineering professionals! Executives and product managers\nwill find that the book provides the necessary background to make\ninformed decisions about the software that their companies build. I\nhave found that the book is a useful tool for building consensus\nbetween management and engineering, because it discusses business\nand customer-related issues without delving too deeply into\nimplementation details.”</p><p>\n         &amp;#8212<b>David\nChaiken</b><br/>\n             Vice\nPresident, Systems Architecture<br/>\n             AgileTV\nCorporation</p><p>“Product marketing influences product architecture. This\nshouldn’t be a surprise, yet most texts on software\narchitecture are silent on this fact. This may be because we lack\nthe language for distinguishing between the technical aspects of an\narchitecture and the marketing aspects. <em>Beyond Software\nArchitecture</em> provides the language to draw this important\ndistinction, and provides strategies for overall architectural\nsuccess.”</p><p>\n         &amp;#8212<b>Dave\nW. Smith</b></p><p>“<em>Beyond Software Architecture</em>, as the title\nimplies, successfully addresses the often neglected aspects of\ndeveloping total solutions. Hohmann demonstrates both passion and\ndepth for the broad set of topics discussed.”</p><p>\n         &amp;#8212<b>Craig\nPriess</b><br/>\n             Director\nProduct Management, Resonant Software</p><p>“Looking through my technical library, it’s apparent\nthat many books are obsolete, casualties of technical innovation\nand change. There are a few, however, that remain and continue to\nbe relevant. Adding Luke Hohmann’s new book, <em>Beyond\nSoftware Architecture: Creating and Sustaining Winning\nSolutions</em> expands that selection and fills an important gap. It\nis the first book that I recall presenting a holistic approach to\nsoftware creation. Going beyond the technical aspe</p></span></span>",

Projects that use this\nantiquated industrial model tend to take longer, promise more, and\ndeliver less.</p><p>As the demand for software has exploded, the software\nengineering establishment has attempted to adapt to the changing\ntimes with short training programs that teach the syntax of coding\nlanguages.

    "description": "<span><span><p><b>Design your networks to successfully\nmanage their growing complexity</b></p><p>Network professionals have often been told\nthat today’s modern control planes would simplify their\nnetworks. The opposite has happened: Technologies like SDN and NFV,\nalthough immensely valuable, are exacerbating complexity instead of\nsolving it. <em>Navigating Network Complexity</em> is the first\ncomprehensive guide to managing this complexity in both deployment\nand day-to-day operations.</p><p>Russ White and Jeff Tantsura introduce\nmodern complexity theory from the standpoint of the working network\nengineer, helping you apply it to the practical problems you face\nevery day. Avoiding complex mathematical models, they show how to\ncharacterize network complexity, so you can understand it and\ncontrol it.</p><p>The authors examine specific techniques and\ntechnologies associated with network control planes, including\nSDNs, fast reroute, segment routing, service chaining, and cloud\ncomputing. They reveal how each of these affects network design and\ncomplexity and help you anticipate causes of failure in highly\ncomplex systems.</p><p>Next, they turn to modern control planes,\nexamining the fundamental operating principles of SDNs, such as\nOpenFlow and I2RS, network and other service function\nvirtualization, content distribution networks, Layer 2 fabrics, and\nservice chaining solutions. You’ll learn how each of these\nmight both resolve and increase complexity in network design and\noperations and what you can do about it.</p><p><b>Coverage includes:</b></p><li><p>\nDefining complexity, understanding its\ncomponents, and measuring it\n</p></li><li><p>\nMastering a straightforward “state,\nspeed, and surface” model for analyzing complexity\n</p></li><li><p>\nControlling complexity in design,\ndeployment, operations, protocols, and programmable networks\n</p></li><li><p>\nUnderstanding how complex network systems\nbegin to fail and how to prevent failure\n</p></li><li><p>\nRecognizing complexity tradeoffs in\nservice virtualization and service chaining\n</p></li><li><p>\nManaging new challenges of complexity in\nvirtualized and cloud environments\n</p></li><li><p>\nLearning why constructs such as\nhierarchical design, aggregation, and protocol layering work and\nwhen they work best\n</p></li><li><p>\nChoosing the right models to contain\ncomplexity as your network changes\n</p></li><p>From start to finish, <em>Navigating Network\nComplexity</em> helps you assess the true impact of new network\ntechnologies, so they can capture more value with fewer\nproblems.</p></span></span>",

Learning how to analyze and model requirements and produce specifications that are connected to working code is the single most fundamental step that you can take toward project success. This book focuses on a delineated and structured methodology that will help you analyze requirements and write comprehensive, verifiable specifications.</p><p>You'll start by learning about the different entities in the requirements domain and how to discover them based on customer input. You'll then explore tried-and-tested methods such as impact mapping and behavior-driven development (BDD), along with new techniques such as D3 and feature-first development. This book takes you through the process of modeling customer requirements as impact maps and writing them as executable specifications. You'll also understand how to organize and prioritize project tasks using Agile frameworks, such as Kanban and Scrum, and verify specifications against the delivered code. Finally, you'll see how to start implementing the requirements management methodology in a real-life scenario.</p><p>By the end of this book, you'll be able to model and manage requirements to create executable specifications that will help you deliver successful software projects.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Kick-start the requirements-gathering and analysis process in your first meeting with the client</li><li>Accurately define system behavior as features</li><li>Model and describe requirement entities using Impact Mapping and BDD</li><li>Create a feature-based product backlog and use it to drive software development</li><li>Write verification code to turn features into executable specifications</li><li>Deliver the right software and respond to change using either Scrum or Kanban</li><li>Choose appropriate software tools to provide transparency and traceability to your clients</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book is for software engineers, business analysts, product managers, project managers, and software project stakeholders looking to learn a variety of techniques and methodologies for collating accurate software requirements. A fundamental understanding of the software development life cycle (SDLC) is needed to get started with this book. Although not necessary, basic knowledge of the Agile philosophy and practices, such as Scrum, along with some programming experience will help you to get the most out of this book.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>Most software engineers come up through the ranks as coders and believe that the valuable lessons they’ve learned from their years in the trenches are an infallible guide to the future. While experience is certainly useful, the emerging field of cognitive psychology has another story to tell: the real reasons for our decisions aren’t entirely the subject of our conscious choice—or even awareness.</p><p>Ian Varley (Salesforce) covers the emerging field of cognitive biases—bugs in our mental operating system—and takes a cold, hard look at how these mental blind spots defeat our attempts to build quality software in every domain. (If you’ve read books like <i>Thinking Fast and Slow</i> and <i>You Are Not So Smart</i>, you’ll be familiar with the basic idea.)</p><p>While awareness of cognitive biases is a good life skill in general, it’s particularly critical if you’re in a software architect role, because your opinions set the conditions for massive amounts of work by other engineers. As such, it’s worth the time to thoroughly debug your own process for learning and making important decisions. Ian explains why the sunk cost fallacy means you’re not throwing things out fast enough; how confirmation bias can sneak into even the most data-driven decisions; how hindsight bias is obscuring the real lessons you might have learned from that failed project; how priming and fixation is shooting down your most promising inputs; and how arguing over architectural decisions is unlikely to help anybody. (See also: “Nobody ever changed their mind between Vim and Emacs.”)</p><p>Most importantly, Ian shares concrete techniques you can use to check your own decision making for these unwelcome guests. We might not be capable of being perfectly rational beings, but we can be a lot less dumb.</p><p>This session was recorded at the 2019 O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference in San Jose.</p></div></span></span>",

Modern software has become complex and adaptable due to the emergence of globalization and new software technologies, devices and networks. These changes challenge both traditional software quality assurance techniques and software engineers to ensure software quality when building today (and tomorrow’s) adaptive, context-sensitive, and highly diverse applications. </p><p>This edited volume presents state of the art techniques, methodologies, tools, best practices and guidelines for software quality assurance and offers guidance for future software engineering research and practice. Each contributed chapter considers the practical application of the topic through case studies, experiments, empirical validation, or systematic comparisons with other approaches already in practice. Topics of interest include, but are not limited, to: quality attributes of system/software architectures; aligning enterprise, system, and software architecture from the point of view of total quality; design decisions and their influence on the quality of system/software architecture; methods and processes for evaluating architecture quality; quality assessment of legacy systems and third party applications; lessons learned and empirical validation of theories and frameworks on architectural quality; empirical validation and testing for assessing architecture quality.</p><ul><li>Focused on quality assurance at all levels of software design and development</li><li>Covers domain-specific software quality assurance issues e.g. for cloud, mobile, security, context-sensitive, mash-up and autonomic systems</li><li>Explains likely trade-offs from design decisions in the context of complex software system engineering and quality assurance</li><li>Includes practical case studies of software quality assurance for complex, adaptive and context-critical systems</li></ul></span>",

However, most businesspeople are not ready to make\ninformed decisions about software initiatives. <b><em><b>The\nEconomics of Iterative Software Development: Steering Toward Better\nBusiness Results</b></em></b> will prepare them. Drawing on decades\nof software development and business experience, the authors\ndemonstrate how to utilize practical, economics-based techniques to\nplan and manage software projects for maximum return on technology\ninvestments.</p><p>The authors begin by dispelling widespread\nmyths about software costs, explaining why traditional,\n“engineering-based” software management introduces\nunacceptable inefficiencies in today’s development\nenvironments. Next, they show business and technical managers how\nto combine the principles of economics and iterative development to\nachieve optimal results with limited resources. Using their\ntechniques, readers will learn how to build systems that enable\nmaximum business innovation and process improvement–and\nimplement software processes that allow them to do so\nconsistently.</p><p>Highlights include</p><li><p>\nHow to repeatedly quantify the value a\nproject is delivering and quickly adjust course as needed\n</p></li><li><p>\nHow to reduce software project size,\ncomplexity, and other “project killers”\n</p></li><li><p>\nHow to identify and eliminate software\ndevelopment processes that don’t work\n</p></li><li><p>\nHow to improve development processes,\nreduce rework, mitigate risk, and identify inefficiencies\n</p></li><li><p>\nHow to create more proficient teams by\nimproving individual skills, team interactions, and organizational\ncapability\n</p></li><li><p>\nWhere to use integrated, automated tools\nto improve effectiveness\n</p></li><li><p>\nWhat to measure, and when: specific\nmetrics for project inception, elaboration, construction, and\ntransition\n</p></li><p><b><em><b>The Economics of Iterative Software\nDevelopment: Steering Toward Better Business Results</b></em></b>\nwill help both business and technical managers make better\ndecisions throughout the software development process–and it\nwill help team and project leaders keep any project or initiative\non track, so they can deliver more value faster.</p></span></span>",

Standards expert Richard Schmidt explains the traditional software engineering practices recognized for developing projects for government or corporate systems. </p><p>Software engineering education often lacks standardization, with many institutions focusing on implementation rather than design as it impacts product architecture. Many graduates join the workforce with incomplete skills, leading to software projects that either fail outright or run woefully over budget and behind schedule. </p><p>Additionally, software engineers need to understand system engineering and architecture—the hardware and peripherals their programs will run on. This issue will only grow in importance as more programs leverage parallel computing, requiring an understanding of the parallel capabilities of processors and hardware. This book gives both software developers and system engineers key insights into how their skillsets support and complement each other. With a focus on these key knowledge areas, <i>Software Engineering </i>offers a set of best practices that can be applied to any industry or domain involved in developing software products.</p><ul><li>A thorough, integrated compilation on the engineering of software products, addressing the majority of the standard knowledge areas and topics </li><li>Offers best practices focused on those key skills common to many industries and domains that develop software </li><li>Learn how software engineering relates to systems engineering for better communication with other engineering professionals within a project environment</li></ul></span>",

A client’s positive experience with project delivery and implementation is a software organization’s calling card in the industry. The lifespan of a software project—from ideation to final installation—introduces dozens of potential pitfalls for a company’s track record, earnings, and overall team morale. However, these “pitfalls” are also opportunities to showcase strengths and to improve an organization’s product quality, and it all starts with project estimation.</p><p>Reliable forecasting continues to present a challenge to even the most veteran teams and software development organizations. Dimitrov sets out to ease these common difficulties with invaluable methodology improvements and helpful visuals from his years of industry experience.

    "description": "<span><p>Most software-development groups have embarrassing records: By\nsome accounts, more than half of all software projects are\nsignificantly late and over budget, and nearly a quarter of them\nare cancelled without ever being completed. Although developers\nrecognize that unrealistic schedules, inadequate resources, and\nunstable requirements are often to blame for such failures, few\nknow how to solve these problems. Fortunately, the Personal\nSoftware Process (PSP) provides a clear and proven solution.\nComprising precise methods developed over many years by Watts S.\nHumphrey and the Software Engineering Institute (SEI), the PSP has\nsuccessfully transformed work practices in a wide range of\norganizations and has already produced some striking results.</p><p>This book describes the PSP and is the definitive guide and\nreference for its latest iteration. PSP training focuses on the\nskills required by individual software engineers to improve their\npersonal performance. Once learned and effectively applied,\nPSP-trained engineers are qualified to participate on a team using\nthe Team Software Process (TSP), the methods for which are\ndescribed in the final chapter of the book. The goal for both PSP\nand TSP is to give developers exactly what they need to deliver\nquality products on predictable schedules.</p><p><b><em>PSP<sup>SM</sup>: A Self-Improvement Process for Software\nEngineers</em></b> presents a disciplined process for software\nengineers and anyone else involved in software development. This\nprocess includes defect management, comprehensive planning, and\nprecise project tracking and reporting.</p><p>The book first scales down industrial software practices to fit\nthe needs of the module-sized program development, then walks\nreaders through a progressive sequence of practices that provide a\nsound foundation for large-scale software development. By doing the\nexercises in the book, and using the PSP methods described here to\nplan, evaluate, manage, and control the quality of your own work,\nyou will be well prepared to apply those methods on ever larger and\nmore critical projects.</p><p>Drawing on the author’s extensive experience helping\norganizations to achieve their development goals, and with the PSP\nbenefits well illustrated, the book presents the process in\ncarefully crafted steps. The first chapter describes overall\nprinciples and strategies. The next two explain how to follow a\ndefined process, as well as how to gather and use the data required\nto manage a programming job. Several chapters then cover estimating\nand planning, followed by quality management and design. The last\ntwo chapters show how to put the PSP to work, and how to use it on\na team project. A variety of support materials for the book, as\ndescribed in the Preface, are available on the Web.</p><p>If you or your organization are looking for a way to improve\nyour project success rate, the PSP could well be your answer.</p><p><br/><br/></p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><i>Economics-driven Software Architecture</i> presents a guide for engineers and architects who need to understand the economic impact of architecture design decisions: the long term and strategic viability, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability of applications and systems. Economics-driven software development can increase quality, productivity, and profitability, but comprehensive knowledge is needed to understand the architectural challenges involved in dealing with the development of large, architecturally challenging systems in an economic way.</p><p>This book covers how to apply economic considerations during the software architecting activities of a project. Architecture-centric approaches to development and systematic evolution, where managing complexity, cost reduction, risk mitigation, evolvability, strategic planning and long-term value creation are among the major drivers for adopting such approaches. It assists the objective assessment of the lifetime costs and benefits of evolving systems, and the identification of legacy situations, where architecture or a component is indispensable but can no longer be evolved to meet changing needs at economic cost. Such consideration will form the scientific foundation for reasoning about the economics of nonfunctional requirements in the context of architectures and architecting.</p><ul><li>Familiarizes readers with essential considerations in economic-informed and value-driven software design and analysis </li><li>Introduces techniques for making value-based software architecting decisions</li><li>Provides readers a better understanding of the methods of economics-driven architecting</li></ul></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Many software projects fail because their leaders don't know how\nto estimate, schedule, or measure them accurately. Fortunately,\nproven tools and techniques exist for every facet of software\nestimation. Estimating Software-Intensive Systems brings them\ntogether in a real-world guidebook that will help software\nmanagers, engineers, and customers immediately improve their\nestimates—and drive continuing improvements over time.</p><p>Dick Stutzke presents here a disciplined and repeatable process\nthat can produce accurate and complete</p><p>estimates for any project, product, or process, no matter how\nnew or unusual. Stutzke doesn't just describe formal techniques: He\noffers simple, easy-to-use templates, spreadsheets, and tools you\ncan start using today to identify and estimate product size,\nperformance, and quality—as well as project cost, schedule,\nand risk reserves.</p><p>Stutzke shows how to quickly \"get your arms around\" users'\nproblems and requirements, the structure of a solution, and the\nprocess needed to deliver it. You'll learn how to choose the most\nappropriate estimating techniques and tools; collect accurate data,\ntrack progress, and update estimates; and recalibrate estimating\nmodels to improve estimation accuracy.</p><p>Stutzke's techniques apply whether you're creating custom\nin-house business software, purchasing or customizing\n\"off-the-shelf\" technology, or constructing complex, one-of-a-kind\nmilitary, industrial, or commercial systems. These techniques apply\nto small and large projects, and to all project life\ncycles—from agile to plan-driven. This book will help you\nplan, estimate, budget, schedule, purchase, design, build, test,\ndeploy, operate, and maintain software-intensive systems. It\nexplains how to size software, identify all cost components,\ncalculate the associated costs, and set a competitive price.</p><p>A separate section covers topics of interest for large projects:\ndesigning an appropriate work breakdown structure, collecting data\nfrom cost accounting systems, and using earned value\nmeasurement.</p><p>An accompanying CD-ROM contains templates, supplemental notes,\nand Microsoft Excel spreadsheets to estimate and track projects,\nproduct characteristics, and processes. It contains an extensive\nbibliography and links to web resources on software estimation,\nmeasurement, and related topics.

    "title": "Practical Embedded Security",
    "description": "<span>\nThe great strides made over the past decade in the complexity and network functionality of embedded systems have significantly enhanced their attractiveness for use in critical applications such as medical devices and military communications. However, this expansion into critical areas has presented embedded engineers with a serious new problem: their designs are now being targeted by the same malicious attackers whose predations have plagued traditional systems for years.  Rising concerns about data security in embedded devices are leading engineers to pay more attention to security assurance in their designs than ever before. This is particularly challenging due to embedded devices’ inherent resource constraints such as limited power and memory. Therefore, traditional security solutions must be customized to fit their profile, and entirely new security concepts must be explored. However, there are few resources available to help engineers understand how to implement security measures within the unique embedded context. This new book from embedded security expert Timothy Stapko is the first to provide engineers with a comprehensive guide to this pivotal topic. From a brief review of basic security concepts, through clear explanations of complex issues such as choosing the best cryptographic algorithms for embedded utilization, the reader is provided with all the information needed to successfully produce safe, secure embedded devices.<ul><li>The ONLY book dedicated to a comprehensive coverage of embedded security!</li><li>Covers both hardware- and software-based embedded security solutions for preventing and dealing with attacks</li><li>Application case studies support practical explanations of all key topics, including network protocols, wireless and cellular communications, languages (Java and C/++), compilers, web-based interfaces, cryptography, and an entire section on SSL</li></ul>\n</span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>In the quest for quality, software\ndevelopers have long focused on improving the internal architecture\nof their products. <b>Larry L. Constantine</b>--who originally\ncreated structured design to effect such improvement--now joins\nwith well-known consultant <b>Lucy A. D. Lockwood</b> to turn the\nfocus of software development to the <em>external</em> architecture.\nIn this book, they present the models and methods of a\nrevolutionary approach to software that will help programmers\ndeliver more <em>usable</em> software--software that will enable\nusers to accomplish their tasks with greater ease and\nefficiency.</p><p>Recognizing usability as the key to\nsuccessful software, Constantine and Lockwood provide concrete\ntools and techniques that programmers can employ to meet that end.\nMuch more than just another set of rules for good user-interface\ndesign, this book guides readers through a systematic software\ndevelopment process. This process, called <em>usage-centered\ndesign,</em> weaves together two major threads in software\ndevelopment methods: use cases (also used with UML) and essential\nmodeling. With numerous examples and case studies of both\nconventional and specialized software applications, the authors\nillustrate what has been shown in practice to work and what has\nproved to be of greatest practical value.</p><p>Highlights</p><li><p>Presents a streamlined process for developing highly usable\nsoftware</p></li><li><p>Describes practical methods and models successfully implemented\nin industry</p></li><li><p>Complements modern development practices, including the Unified\nProcess and other object-oriented software engineering\napproaches</p></li></span></span>",

What makes this task challenging in today’s world, is that the technical challenges we as developers strive to overcome are becoming increasingly more complex. We have to consider many more options when it comes to things like requirements, solution hosting, support, pace of change, and generally with less time and warning.</p><p>A good developer knows that it is critical to manage every aspect of software development from soup to nuts, and understands that when details and decisions are left to chance, outcomes can be negatively impacted.

This leads to software that is fragile in terms of extensibility and difficult to test without fully integrated software and hardware. <i>Patterns in the Machine</i> focuses on creating loosely coupled implementations that embrace both change and testability.</p><p>This book illustrates how implementing continuous integration, automated unit testing, platform-independent code, and other best practices that are not typically implemented in the embedded systems world is not just feasible but also practical for today’s embedded projects.</p><p>After reading this book, you will have a better idea of how to structure your embedded software projects. You will recognize that while writing unit tests, creating simulators, and implementing continuous integration requires time and effort up front, you will be amply rewarded at the end of the project in terms of quality, adaptability, and maintainability of your code. </p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li> Incorporate automated unit      testing into an embedded project</li><li>Design and build functional      simulators for an embedded project</li><li>Write production-quality      software when hardware is not available</li><li>Use the Data Model      architectural pattern to create a highly decoupled design and implementation</li><li>Understand the importance of      defining the software architecture before implementation starts and      how to do it</li><li>Discover why documentation      is essential for an embedded project</li><li>Use finite state machines in      embedded projects</li></ul><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p>\n\nMid-level or higher embedded systems (firmware) developers, technical leads, software architects, and development managers.</span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Equip yourself to navigate organizational politics in the world of software development. This book will help you understand the power dynamics at work between competing stakeholders with conflicting goals in projects and organizations. </p><p><i>Politics in Software Development </i>consists of three main parts. Author Peter Wendorff begins by defining key concepts in organizational politics. He then moves on to software development processes and investigates how their design reflects stakeholder interests. In the final part, he highlights the role of political skill in software development and provides an overview of tactics that stakeholders frequently use.</p><p>There is widespread competition within organizations for rewards, recognition, status, and power. It gives rise to political behavior of stakeholders, which is generally seen as a problem. This negative view of organizational politics tends to overlook its positive functions. For example, it can also be thought of as an arena where stakeholders with conflicting goals can argue, persuade, negotiate, bargain, and cooperate to address conflicts. </p><p>Political conflict resolution regularly happens in organizations in an entirely civilized manner. It helps find agreements that reconcile differences in a constructive way, and it is needed because stakeholder conflicts are simply a natural aspect of organizations. While there is much literature about organizational politics, very few authors consider the specifics of software development.

    "description": "<span>Master how to implement a repeatable software construction system. This book closely examines how a system is designed to tie a series of activities together that are needed when building software-intensive systems. <div><br/></div><div>Software construction and operations don't get enough attention as a repeatable system. The world is stuck in agile backlog grooming sessions, and quality is not increasing. Companies' budgets are shrinking, and teams need a way to get more done with less, consistently. This topic is very relevant to our current economic conditions and continuing globalization trends. A reason we constantly need more hands-on-the-keyboards is because of all the waste created in development cycles. We need more literature on how to \"do software\" not just write software.  </div><div><br/></div><div>These goals are accomplished using the concept of evolutions, much like the Navy SEALS train their team members.  For LIFT, the evolutions are: Plan, Build, Test, Release, Operate and Manage.  The entire purpose of the book is instructing professionals how to use these distinct evolutions while remaining agile. And then, inside of each evolution, to explicitly break down the inputs to the evolution, outputs and series of activities taking place.<i> Patterns of Software Constructio</i>n clearly outlines how together this becomes the system.</div><div><br/></div><div><b>What You Will Learn</b></div><div><div><ul><li>Optimize each evolution of a software delivery cycle</li><li>Review best practices of planning, highest return in the build cycle, and ignored practices in test, release, and operate </li><li>Apply the highest return techniques during the software build evolution</li></ul></div><div><br/></div><div><b>Who This Book is For</b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>Managers, developers, tech lead, team lead, aspiring engineer, department leaders in corporations, executives, small business owner, IT Director<br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></div><div><br/></div></span>",

The authors have considerable real-world experience in delivering quality systems that matter, and their expertise shines through in these pages. Here you will learn what technical debt is, what is it not, how to manage it, and how to pay it down in responsible ways. This is a book I wish I had when I was just beginning my career. The authors present a myriad of case studies, born from years of experience, and offer a multitude of actionable insights for how to apply it to your project.”</i><br/>–Grady Booch, IBM Fellow</div><div> </div><div><b>Master Best Practices for Managing Technical Debt to Promote Software Quality and Productivity</b><br/>As software systems mature, earlier design or code decisions made in the context of budget or schedule constraints increasingly impede evolution and innovation. This phenomenon is called technical debt, and practical solutions exist. In <b>Managing Technical Debt</b>, three leading experts introduce integrated, empirically developed principles and practices that any software professional can use to gain control of technical debt in any software system.<br/><br/>Using real-life examples, the authors explain the forms of technical debt that afflict software-intensive systems, their root causes, and their impacts. They introduce proven approaches for identifying and assessing specific sources of technical debt, limiting new debt, and “paying off” debt over time. They describe how to establish managing technical debt as a core software engineering practice in your organization.<br/>\n<ul><li>Discover how technical debt damages manageability, quality, productivity, and morale–and what you can do about it</li><li>Clarify root causes of debt, including the linked roles of business goals, source code, architecture, testing, and infrastructure</li><li>Identify technical debt items, and analyze their costs so you can prioritize action</li><li>Choose the right solution for each technical debt item: eliminate, reduce, or mitigate</li><li>Integrate software engineering practices that minimize new debt</li></ul>\n</div><div><b>Managing Technical Debt</b> will be a valuable resource for every software professional who wants to accelerate innovation in existing systems, or build new systems that will be easier to maintain and evolve.</div></span>",

Mastering Embedded Linux Programming is a fully comprehensive guide that can serve both as means to learn new things or as a handy reference. </p><p>The first few chapters of this book will  break down the fundamental elements that underpin all embedded Linux projects: the toolchain, the bootloader, the kernel, and the root filesystem. After that, you will learn how to create each of these elements from scratch and automate the process using Buildroot and the Yocto Project. As you progress, the book will  show you how to implement an effective storage strategy for flash memory chips and install updates to a device remotely once it's deployed. </p><p>You'll also learn about the key aspects of writing code for embedded Linux, such as how to access hardware from apps, the implications of writing multi-threaded code, and techniques to manage memory in an efficient way. The final chapters demonstrate how to debug your code, whether it resides in apps or in the Linux kernel itself. </p><p>You'll also cover the different tracers and profilers that are available for Linux so that you can quickly pinpoint any performance bottlenecks in your system.</p><p>By the end of this Linux book, you'll be able to create efficient and secure embedded devices using Linux.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Use Buildroot and the Yocto Project to create embedded Linux systems</li><li>Troubleshoot BitBake build failures and streamline your Yocto development workflow</li><li>Update IoT devices securely in the field using Mender or balena</li><li>Prototype peripheral additions by reading schematics, modifying device trees, soldering breakout boards, and probing pins with a logic analyzer</li><li>Interact with hardware without having to write kernel device drivers</li><li>Divide your system up into services supervised by BusyBox runit</li><li>Debug devices remotely using GDB and measure the performance of systems using tools such as perf, ftrace, eBPF, and Callgrind</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>If you're a systems software engineer or system administrator who wants to learn how to implement Linux on embedded devices, then this book is for you. It's also aimed at embedded systems engineers accustomed to programming for low-power microcontrollers, who can use this book to help make the leap to high-speed systems on chips that can run Linux. Anyone who develops hardware that needs to run Linux will find something useful in this book – but before you get started, you'll need a solid grasp on POSIX standard, C programming, and shell scripting.</p></span>",

And you may not even have heard of Alloy, Modelica, or SNOBOL. But all are identified as languages, even if they’re not generally considered as such. So what are the distinctions among them? And maybe most importantly, what can programmers learn from “not programming languages”?</p><p>Join us for a special conversation on programming languages with Neal Ford and Mozilla software engineer Chelsea Troy. They’ll talk about what constitutes a programming language, what we can learn from questioning how we categorize things, and how to identify “assumed context” and why it matters.

    "description": "<span><p>Conventional build-then-test practices are\nmaking today’s embedded, software-reliant systems\nunaffordable to build. In response, more than thirty leading\nindustrial organizations have joined SAE (formerly, the Society of\nAutomotive Engineers) to define the SAE Architecture Analysis &amp;\nDesign Language (AADL) AS-5506 Standard, a rigorous and extensible\nfoundation for model-based engineering analysis practices that\nencompass software system design, integration, and assurance. Using\nAADL, you can conduct lightweight and rigorous analyses of critical\nreal-time factors such as performance, dependability, security, and\ndata integrity. You can integrate additional established and custom\nanalysis/specification techniques into your engineering\nenvironment, developing a fully unified architecture model that\nmakes it easier to build reliable systems that meet customer\nexpectations.</p><p><b><em>Model-Based Engineering with\nAADL</em></b> is the first guide to using this new international\nstandard to optimize your development processes. Coauthored by\nPeter H. Feiler, the standard’s author and technical lead,\nthis introductory reference and tutorial is ideal for self-directed\nlearning or classroom instruction, and is an excellent reference\nfor practitioners, including architects, developers, integrators,\nvalidators, certifiers, first-level technical leaders, and project\nmanagers. Packed with real-world examples, it introduces all\naspects of the AADL notation as part of an architecture-centric,\nmodel-based engineering approach to discovering embedded software\nsystems problems earlier, when they cost less to solve. Throughout,\nthe authors compare AADL to other modeling notations and\napproaches, while presenting the language via a complete case\nstudy: the development and analysis of a realistic example system\nthrough repeated refinement and analysis.</p><p><b>Part One</b> introduces both the AADL\nlanguage and core Model-Based Engineering (MBE) practices,\nexplaining basic software systems modeling and analysis in the\ncontext of an example system, and offering practical guidelines for\neffectively applying AADL.</p><p><b>Part Two</b> describes the\ncharacteristics of each AADL element, including their\nrepresentations, applicability, and constraints.</p><p>The Appendix includes comprehensive listings\nof AADL language elements, properties incorporated in the AADL\nstandard, and a description of the book’s example system.</p></span>",

Hilburn, Professor<br/>\nDepartment of Computer and Software Engineering<br/>\nEmbry-Riddle Aeronautical University</p><p>Is your organization maximizing the return on its investments of\nmoney, time, and personnel? Probably not, because most software\nprofessionals don't know how to consider the business aspects of\ntheir software decisions. Most don't even know that it's important\nto do so. Business consequences should play a critical role in all\nsoftware technical choices—from choosing which projects to\ndo, selecting software development processes, choosing algorithms\nand data structures, all the way to determining how much testing is\nenough.</p><p><b><em>Return on Software: Maximizing the Return on Your Software\nInvestment</em></b> is about making choices: software technical\nchoices in a business context. It helps software professionals\nappreciate the business consequences of the decisions they make.\nThis primer will prove a valuable reference for making the\nimportant decisions the typical software organization faces both\ntoday and down the road. Inside, you'll learn how to:</p><li><p>Estimate how much each proposed software technical decision will\ncost, and how much it will return.</p></li><li><p>Weigh the time frames for a software decision's costs and\nbenefits against each other to reveal when there might be a more\nimportant factor than schedule.</p></li><li><p>Attach a value to quality and produce a rational answer to the\nquestion, \"How much testing is enough?\"</p></li><li><p>Account for risk and uncertainty in software technical\ndecisions, such as when considering a new technology.</p></li><li><p>Communicate your decisions in a way that speaks to the\nall-important bottom line.</p></li><p>Each chapter contains a set of self-study questions designed to\nhelp you apply the featured concepts and techniques.

In this introductory level course, InnerSource experts Danese Cooper and Russell Rutledge draw on their own experiences at companies like PayPal, Nike, and more to describe how InnerSource methods solve real world issues. How do I get teams located in far flung locations, possibly speaking different languages, and using different tools to work together effectively? How do I teach teams to contribute code without disrupting each other's workflow? How can I encourage developers in one business unit to incorporate functionality in their products using features developed by a competing business unit? These are just a few of the concerns InnerSource can address. By the end of this course, you'll have a firm understanding of InnerSource's key practices (collaboration, transparency, and mentorship) and a solid grasp of how you can use them to transform your own team from average to excellent.</p><ul><li>Understand the connection between open source and InnerSource</li><li>Acquire a fundamental understanding of what InnerSource is—and what it isn't</li><li>Learn about the transformative practices of collaboration, transparency, and mentorship</li><li>Hear first-hand accounts of InnerSource in action, where it worked and why</li><li>Discover how InnerSource can resolve the thorny issues faced by developers everywhere</li></ul><p>Danese Cooper is the Head of Open Source at Paypal, where she runs OASIS, an office devoted to engineering cultural change through open source, InnerSource, and other key initiatives.

    "description": "<span><span><span><p><i>There is today a pronounced and accelerated convergence in architecture. This convergence is occurring by doers not thinkers; in practice not academia; in building design, fabrication, and construction. It is about solution-centric individuals engaged in real time problem solving, not in abstractions. The nature of this convergence, where things are converging and what that means for architecture, is the subject of this book. –</i> from the Introduction<br/><br/></p><p>Those working in architecture and engineering feel pressure to work faster, at lower cost, while maintaining a high level of innovation and quality. At the same time, emergent tools and processes make this possible. <i>Convergence</i> is about the firms, teams and people who thrive in this environment as a result of their ability to creatively combine and innovate. It seeks to answer several timely questions: What are the tools and work processes that are converging? How are individuals and organizations converging their tools and work processes? What challenges and benefits are they seeing? What is the ultimate endgame of this convergence? What skillsets and mindsets would someone need to develop to work effectively in this changing environment? What are the implications of convergence on the role of the designer, and on design? On how we design, build, fabricate, and construct? On how we <i>work</i>?</p><p>The book explains how convergence relates to, but ultimately differs from integration, consolidation, multi-tasking, automation, and other forms of optimization. The practice-based research builds upon the author’s research in BIM and in the collaborative leveraging of data in design and fabrication. As an investigation and meditation on the impact of technology on the education and making of design professionals <i>Convergence</i> explains what is happening in the world of design, and discusses the implications for the future of education, training and practice.</p><p> </p></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is an advanced technique\nthat supports decision makers in structuring complex decisions,\nquantifying intangible factors, and evaluating choices in\nmultiobjective decision situations. It is a comprehensive and\nrational decision-making framework that provides a powerful\nmethodology for determining relative worth among a set of elements.\nAHP is especially suitable for complex decisions that involve the\ncomparison of decision elements which are difficult to quantify.\nThe AHP, and its more recent version the Analytic Network Process\n(ANP), were developed by Dr. Thomas Saaty and have been applied in\na wide variety of decision situations in organizations worldwide.\nAHP is particularly applicable in managing software complexity, and\nin Quality Function Deployment (QFD), as presented in Chapter 11 of\nthe book <em>Design for Trustworthy Software</em>.</p><p>This short cut illustrates the application of AHP in\nprioritizing complex design issues. It also shows how AHP and its\nsupporting software, Expert Choice (EC), can handle much higher\nlevels of complexities accurately and expeditiously than the\nprioritization matrices introduced in Chapter 7 of <em>Design for\nTrustworthy Software</em>. In addition to solutions facilitated by\nEC, this short cut also illustrates two known approximations to AHP\nsolutions using manual calculations. Manual calculations can be\nused to solve relatively less complex problems. They are presented\nin this short cut to illustrate the first principles and the steps\ninvolved in AHP.</p><p>This short cut is a reproduction of Chapter 8 of the book\n<em>Design for Trustworthy Software</em> and introduces AHP with a\nsimple example. It can be used either as a methodology in\ntrustworthy software design process or as a standalone introductory\npresentation on AHP.</p><p>This short cut should be of interest to software and quality\nprofessionals. In particular, it would be of value to the CMMI, Six\nSigma, and DFSS communities worldwide, especially those who have\nacquired or plan to acquire Green Belt, Black Belt, Master Black\nBelt, or similar competencies in various quality management\ndisciplines. It should also be a useful resource for students and\nacademicians of various programs at senior undergraduate and\ngraduate levels, and for those preparing for ASQ's Certified\nSoftware Quality Engineer (CSQE) examination.</p><p>What This Short Cut Covers 3</p><p>Introduction 4</p><p>Prioritization, Complexity, and the Analytic Hierarchy Process\n4</p><p>Multiobjective Decision-Making and AHP 5</p><p>Case Study 1 Solution Using Expert Choice 12</p><p>Approximations to AHP with Manual Calculations 22</p><p>Conclusion 33</p><p>Key Points 33</p><p>Additional Resources 34</p><p>Internet Exercises 34</p><p>Review Questions 34</p><p>Discussion Questions and Projects 35</p><p>Problems 36</p><p>Endnotes 45</p><p>What's in the Book <em>Design for Trustworthy Software</em> 47</p><p>About the Authors 52</p><p>The Design for Trustworthy Software Digital Short Cut\nCompilation 53</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Without standardized construction elements such as nuts, bolts, bearings, beams, resistors and the like, the design of physical equipment is hopelessly inefficient, and engineers are continually bogged down with re-designing these elements over and over again. Emphasizing a top-down approach, this volume considers the purpose and basic features of design and how the concept of value can provide a quantitative measure of that wider interaction of the engineered object with its environment. This work also develops the domain in which functional design takes place and explores how the system concept can be embedded in that domain. It proposes a number of functional design elements and develops them in considerable detail, outlining how they can be applied as part of a coherent design framework. For greater understanding of the discussed concepts, numerous examples and analogies are included.</p></span>",

    "title": "The Design for Trustworthy Software Compilation Understanding Customer Needs: Software QFD and the Voice of the Customer",
    "description": "<span><span><p>Leading companies around the world, including Toyota and General\nElectric, have practiced Quality Function Deployment (QFD) for\ndecades. Developed in Japan by Dr. Yoji Akao and Dr. Shigeru\nMizuno, QFD has two aims: to ensure that true customer needs are\nproperly deployed throughout all phases of the development process,\nand to improve the development process itself. The application of\nQFD to software (Software QFD) began in Japan in 1982, in North\nAmerica in 1988, and in Europe in 1990. Today many leading software\norganizations around the world use Software QFD and it is an\nessential part of organization-wide quality approaches such as\nTotal Quality Management (TQM) and Design for Six Sigma (DFSS).</p><p>As a quality system, QFD employs, but is not limited to, the\nSeven Management and Planning (7 MP) Tools, introduced in Chapter 7\nof the book <em>Design for Trustworthy Software</em>. It has\ndeployments, or subsystems, to address customer concerns such as\nquality, technology, cost/schedule, and reliability/risk, among\nothers. Although QFD is known for the \"House of Quality\" matrix,\norganizations that simply use this matrix alone neither meet the\naims of QFD nor are considered to be \"doing QFD\" by leading QFD\nexperts. Further, because of unfortunate historical errors in\nunderstanding, many published QFD examples are incorrect and are\nnot suitable as models for software development. Such mistakes are\ncorrected in the overview of Blitz QFD presented in this short\ncut.</p><p>This short cut is a reproduction of Chapter 11 of the book\n<em>Design for Trustworthy Software</em> and introduces Software QFD\nas a part of trustworthy software development process. It can be\nused either as an important methodology in software design process\nor as a standalone presentation on QFD for software development\nprocess.</p><p>This short cut should be of interest to software and quality\nprofessionals. In particular, it would be of value to the CMMI, Six\nSigma, and DFSS communities worldwide, especially those who have\nacquired or plan to acquire Green Belt, Black Belt, Master Black\nBelt, or similar competencies in various quality management\ndisciplines. It should also be useful resource for students and\nacademics of various programs at senior undergraduate and graduate\nlevels, and for those preparing for ASQ's Certified Software\nQuality Engineer (CSQE) examination.</p><p>What This Short Cut Covers 3</p><p>QFD: Origin and Introduction 4</p><p>Problems with Traditional QFD Applied to Software 20</p><p>Modern QFD for Software 25</p><p>The Blitz QFD Process 28</p><p>Implementing Software QFD 45</p><p>Conclusion 50</p><p>Key Points 52</p><p>Additional Resources 54</p><p>Internet Exercises 54</p><p>Review Questions 56</p><p>Discussion Questions 57</p><p>Endnotes 58</p><p>What's in the Book <em>Design for Trustworthy Software</em> 64</p><p>About the Authors 69</p><p>The Design for Trustworthy Software Digital Short Cut\nCompilation 70</p></span></span>",

This naturally adds complexity to existing integration points and can lead to development overhead. Luckily, there’s a set of data-driven development principles built to alleviate precisely these challenges. Join Caito Scherr to explore these principles in detail and learn how to apply them at various points throughout the development process, using real-world successes (and failures!) as examples. Although the examples are about highly complex systems, this talk will be beginner friendly and applicable to nonstreaming use cases.",

Developing Software for Symbian OS remedies this problem as it provides a comprehensive coverage of all the key concepts. Numerous examples and descriptions are also included, which focus on the concepts the author has seen developers struggle with the most. The book covers development ranging from low-level system programming to end user GUI applications. It also covers the development and packaging tools, as well as providing some detailed reference and examples for key APIs. The new edition includes a completely new chapter on platform security.</p><p>The overall goal of the book is to provide introductory coverage of Symbian OS v9 and help developers with little or no knowledge of Symbian OS to develop as quickly as possible. There are few people with long Symbian development experience compared to demand, due to the rapid growth of Symbian in recent years, and developing software for new generation wireless devices requires knowledge and experience of OS concepts. This book will use many comparisons between Symbian OS and other OSes to help in that transition.</p><p>Get yourself ahead with the perfect introduction to developing software for Symbian OS.</p></span></span></span></span>",

Now that aspect-oriented programming (AOP) can\nexpress crosscutting concerns directly in code, the man who\ndeveloped use cases has proposed step-by-step methods for\nrecognizing crosscutting concerns in use cases and writing the code\nin separate modules. If these methods are at all fruitful in your\ndesign and development practice, they will make a big difference in\nsoftware quality for developers and users alike.<br/>\n<br/>\n—<b>Wes Isberg,</b> AspectJ team member\n</p><p>\n“This book not only provides ideas and examples of what\naspect-oriented software development is but how it can be utilized\nin a real development project.”<br/>\n<br/>\n—<b>MichaelWard,</b> ThoughtWorks, Inc.\n</p><p>\n“No system has ever been designed from scratch perfectly;\nevery system is composed of features layered in top of features\nthat accumulate over time. Conventional design techniques do not\nhandle this well, and over time the integrity of most systems\ndegrades as a result. For the first time, here is a set of\ntechniques that facilitates composition of behavior that not only\nallows systems to be defined in terms of layered functionality but\ncomposition is at the very heart of the approach. This book is an\nimportant advance in modern methodology and is certain to influence\nthe direction of software engineering in the next decade, just as\nObject-Oriented Software Engineering influenced the\nlast.”<br/>\n<br/>\n—<b>Kurt Bittner,</b> IBM Corporation\n</p><p>\n“Use cases are an excellent means to capture system\nrequirements and drive a user-centric view of system development\nand testing. This book offers a comprehensive guide on explicit\nuse-case-driven development from early requirements modeling to\ndesign and implementation. It provides a simple yet rich set of\nguidelines to realize use-case models using aspect-oriented design\nand programming. It is a valuable resource to researchers and\npractitioners alike.”<br/>\n<br/>\n—<b>Dr. Awais Rashid,</b> Lancaster University, U.K., and\nauthor of <em>Aspect-Oriented Database Systems</em>\n</p><p>\n“AOSD is important technology that will help developers\nproduce better systems. Unfortunately, it has not been obvious how\nto integrate AOSD across a project’s lifecycle. This book\nshatters that barrier, providing concrete examples on how to use\nAOSD from requirements analysis through testing.”<br/>\n<br/>\n—<b>Charles B. Haley,</b> research fellow, The Open\nUniversity, U.K.\n</p><p>Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a revolutionary new way to\nthink about software engineering. AOP was introduced to address\ncrosscutting concerns such as security, logging, persistence,\ndebugging, tracing, distribution, performance monitoring, and\nexception handling in a more effective manner. Unlike conventional\ndevelopment techniques, which scatter the implementation of each\nconcern into multiple classes, aspect-oriented programming\nlocalizes them.</p><p>Aspect-oriented software development (AOSD) uses this approach\nto create a better modularity for functional and nonfunctional\nrequirements, platform specifics, and more, allowing you to build\nmore understandable systems that are easier to configure and extend\nto meet the evolving needs of stakeholders.</p><p>In this highly anticipated new book, Ivar Jacobson and Pan-Wei\nNg demonstrate how to apply use cases—a mature and systematic\napproach to focusing on stakeholder concerns—and\naspect-orientation in building robust and extensible systems.\nThroughout the book, the authors employ a single, real-world\nexample of a hotel management information system to make the\ndescribed theories and practices concrete and understandable.</p><p>The authors show how to identify, design, implement, test, and\nrefactor use-case modules, as well as extend them. They also\ndemonstrate how to design use-case modules with the Unified\nModeling Language (UML)—emphasizing enhancements made in UML\n2.0—and how to achieve use-case modularity using aspect\ntechnologies, notably AspectJ.</p><p>Key topics include</p><li><p>Making the case for use cases and aspects</p></li><li><p>Capturing and modeling concerns with use cases</p></li><li><p>Keeping concerns separate with use-case modules</p></li><li><p>Modeling use-cases slices and aspects using the newest\nextensions to the UML notation</p></li><li><p>Applying use cases and aspects in projects</p></li><p>Whatever your level of experience with aspect-oriented\nprogramming, <b><em>Aspect-Oriented Software Development with Use\nCases</em></b> will teach you how to develop better software by\nembracing the paradigm shift to AOSD.</p><p><br/><br/></p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p><b>A practical approach to estimating and tracking dynamic systems in real-worl applications</b></p><p>Much of the literature on performing estimation for non-Gaussian systems is short on practical methodology, while Gaussian methods often lack a cohesive derivation. <em>Bayesian Estimation and Tracking</em> addresses the gap in the field on both accounts, providing readers with a comprehensive overview of methods for estimating both linear and nonlinear dynamic systems driven by Gaussian and non-Gaussian noices.</p><p>Featuring a unified approach to Bayesian estimation and tracking, the book emphasizes the derivation of all tracking algorithms within a Bayesian framework and describes effective numerical methods for evaluating density-weighted integrals, including linear and nonlinear Kalman filters for Gaussian-weighted integrals and particle filters for non-Gaussian cases. The author first emphasizes detailed derivations from first principles of eeach estimation method and goes on to use illustrative and detailed step-by-step instructions for each method that makes coding of the tracking filter simple and easy to understand.</p><p>Case studies are employed to showcase applications of the discussed topics. In addition, the book supplies block diagrams for each algorithm, allowing readers to develop their own MATLAB toolbox of estimation methods.</p><p><em>Bayesian Estimation and Tracking</em> is an excellent book for courses on estimation and tracking methods at the graduate level. The book also serves as a valuable reference for research scientists, mathematicians, and engineers seeking a deeper understanding of the topics.</p></span></span></span>",

    "title": "The Design for Trustworthy Software Compilation Taguchi Methods and Optimization for Robust Software",
    "description": "<span><span><p>The software industry stands on the brink of an era of dramatic\nchange. We expect the industry to continue the restructuring\nprocess already begun, emerging as a much smaller number of\nhorizontally structured firms mostly doing business with each\nother. As software becomes highly \"componentized,\" the industry\nwill begin to resemble the automotive industry, with many small\nfirms making parts, but only a few large ones assembling them into\nfinished products. Software automation in the form of application\ngeneration technology will become the norm as system analysts and\nother domain specialists become the new application programmers,\nwriting in specification languages. Meanwhile, the more talented of\ntoday's application programmers will become system programmers,\nwriting the meta-compilers that will transform specification\nlanguage codes into Java and C application programs.</p><p>It is still true that new technologies do not replace old\ntechnologies, at least not at first; in their infancy, they merely\nsupplement them. Chapters 16, 17, 18 and 19 of the book <em>Design\nfor Trustworthy Software</em> address the transition period during\nwhich robust, trustworthy software is still created by current\ntechnology and processes as the new technology and its streamlined\nprocesses emerge.</p><p>This short cut is a reproduction of Chapter 17 of <em>Design for\nTrustworthy Software</em>. It illustrates how Taguchi's quality loss\nfunction provides a measure of the overall loss to society when a\nproduct fails to meet its target functionality and reliability. It\ndescribes howsignal-to-noise ratio measures the positive quality\ncontribution from controllable or design factors versus the\nnegative quality contribution from uncontrollable or noise factors.\nIt presents Taguchi Methods involving seven steps, beginning with a\nclear statement of thedesign problem and ending with a confirming\nstatisticalexperiment showing how parameter choices will enhance\nrobustness. An example from electrical circuit design is presented,\nbecause it is much more similar to software design than mechanical\ndesign, where Taguchi Methods have found their largest\napplications. A more detailed example from software design or\nproduct improvement builds on the previous example. Lastly, this\nshort cut describes Taguchi's development and application of an\nearlier technique involving Latin squares or orthogonal matrices to\nallow the evaluation on multiple parameters simultaneously. It\nillustrates how his use of orthogonal matrices permits a\nmultifactorial analysis that is far more efficient than a\nconventional \"bottleneck\" analysis, and how it allows the study of\nfactor interactions.</p><p>This short cut can be used either as an important methodology of\ntrustworthy software design process or as a standalone presentation\nof Taguchi Methods in software development context.</p><p>This short cut should be of interest to software and quality\nprofessionals. In particular, it should be of value to the CMMI,\nSix Sigma, and DFSS communities worldwide, especially for those who\nhave acquired or plan to acquire Green Belt, Black Belt, Master\nBlack Belt, or similar competencies in various quality management\ndisciplines. It should also be useful resource for students and\nacademics of various programs at senior undergraduate and graduate\nlevels, and for those preparing for American Society for Quality's\n(ASQ) Certified Software Quality Engineer (CSQE) examination.</p><p>What This Short Cut Covers 3</p><p>Introduction 4</p><p>Taguchi Methods for Robust Software Design 5</p><p>An Example from Engineering Design 9</p><p>An Example from Software Design and Development 12</p><p>Orthogonal Matrices for Taguchi Parameter Design Experiments\n16</p><p>Applications to the Design of Trustworthy Software 19</p><p>Key Points 19</p><p>Additional Resources 20</p><p>Exercises 20</p><p>Endnotes 21</p><p>What's in the Book <em>Design for Trustworthy Software</em> 23</p><p>About the Authors 28</p><p>The Design for Trustworthy Software Digital Short Cut\nCompilation 29</p></span></span>",

Supplying rigorous theoretical analysis, it presents the material and proposed algorithms in a manner that makes it easy to understand—providing readers with the modeling and identification skills required for successful theoretical research and effective application.<br/><br/>The book begins by introducing the basic concepts of probability theory, including martingales, martingale difference sequences, Markov chains, mixing processes, and stationary processes. Next, it discusses the root-seeking problem for functions, starting with the classic RM algorithm, but with attention mainly paid to the stochastic approximation algorithms with expanding truncations (SAAWET) which serves as the basic tool for recursively solving the problems addressed in the book.<br/><br/>The book not only identifies the results of system identification and parameter estimation, but also demonstrates how to apply the proposed approaches for addressing problems in a range of areas, including:</p><ul><li>Identification of ARMAX systems without imposing restrictive conditions</li><li>Identification of typical nonlinear systems</li><li>Optimal adaptive tracking</li><li>Consensus of multi-agents systems</li><li>Principal component analysis</li><li>Distributed randomized PageRank computation</li><p/></ul><p>This book recursively identifies autoregressive and moving average with exogenous input (ARMAX) and discusses the identification of non-linear systems. It concludes by addressing the problems arising from different areas that are solved by SAAWET.

    "description": "<span><span><span><span><p><b>Covers the significant embedded computing technologies—highlighting their applications in wireless communication and computing power</b></p><p>An embedded system is a computer system designed for specific control functions within a larger system—often with real-time computing constraints. It is embedded as part of a complete device often including hardware and mechanical parts. Presented in three parts, <em>Embedded Systems: Hardware, Design, and Implementation</em> provides readers with an immersive introduction to this rapidly growing segment of the computer industry.</p><p>Acknowledging the fact that embedded systems control many of today's most common devices such as smart phones, PC tablets, as well as hardware embedded in cars, TVs, and even refrigerators and heating systems, the book starts with a basic introduction to embedded computing systems. It hones in on system-on-a-chip (SoC), multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC), and network-on-chip (NoC). It then covers on-chip integration of software and custom hardware accelerators, as well as fabric flexibility, custom architectures, and the multiple I/O standards that facilitate PCB integration.</p><p>Next, it focuses on the technologies associated with embedded computing systems, going over the basics of field-programmable gate array (FPGA), digital signal processing (DSP) and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) technology, architectural support for on-chip integration of custom accelerators with processors, and O/S support for these systems.</p><p>Finally, it offers full details on architecture, testability, and computer-aided design (CAD) support for embedded systems, soft processors, heterogeneous resources, and on-chip storage before concluding with coverage of software support—in particular, O/S Linux.</p><p><em>Embedded Systems: Hardware, Design, and Implementation</em> is an ideal book for design engineers looking to optimize and reduce the size and cost of embedded system products and increase their reliability and performance.</p></span></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Within one generation, software has become one of the principal sources of wealth in the world. The development and use of software has grown faster than for any artifact in the history of the world. Probably no topic or subject in history has accelerated in its rate of practice as software has. Software development now needs to mature into a disciplined activity to overcome the difficulties that have traditionally plagued it. Software developers, engineers, and project managers need a reference that describes the evolution of software: where it has been, and where it is going. The Laws of Software Process: A New Model for the Production and Management of Software reveals a novel and compelling structure for development that redefines the very nature and purpose of software. The author explains how, in the modern \"knowledge economy,\" software systems are not \"products\" in the classical sense, but is the modern medium for the conveyance of information. Literally, software is the currency of the knowledge basis of wealth in today's society. From this definition flows a new assessment of the basics of software development: the purpose of methods and processes; a comparison of programming languages; and an analysis of quality management, cost estimation, and project management and completion. The groundbreaking perspective outlined in this book serves as an expert guide for successful planning and execution of development projects.</p></span>",

It then takes up financial measurement, describing and analyzing the typologies of financial indicators while illustrating their advantages and disadvantages.

    "description": "Today the software landscape of enterprise isn’t built ground up by scores of software developers. Software engineering skills are valuable and focus on the core domain of the business. But for the rest, software is often purchased—and much of it consists of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) platforms. While these platforms perform critical functions such as managing customer data, architects often treat them as something to work around. However, it’s becoming increasingly important for an architect to understand these commercial platforms as well as the best practices for managing them and the techniques (such as DDD) that will help obtain the most value. Sonya Natanzon shares her extensive experience as a solutions architect in the world of commercial platforms and details a case study of how commercial platforms helped mass testing during COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "description": "There are several well-known challenges with managing data in microservice architectures, including transaction management. How can database operations ensure validity despite executing across multiple isolated contexts? How can they still provide reliability and durability guarantees? How will issues like failures, partial executions, and race conditions be remediated? Tola Awofolu walks you through the saga pattern—an approach for handling database transactions that span multiple requests. Join in to see how to implement the pattern using an event-driven tech stack, with a specific focus on Spring Statemachine.",

    "description": "<span><span><p>An understanding of random processes is crucial to many engineering fields-including communication theory, computer vision, and digital signal processing in electrical and computer engineering, and vibrational theory and stress analysis in mechanical engineering. The filtering, estimation, and detection of random processes in noisy environments are critical tasks necessary in the analysis and design of new communications systems and useful signal processing algorithms. Random Processes: Filtering, Estimation, and Detection clearly explains the basics of probability and random processes and details modern detection and estimation theory to accomplish these tasks.</p><p>In this book, Lonnie Ludeman, an award-winning authority in digital signal processing, joins the fundamentals of random processes with the standard techniques of linear and nonlinear systems analysis and hypothesis testing to give signal estimation techniques, specify optimum estimation procedures, provide optimum decision rules for classification purposes, and describe performance evaluation definitions and procedures for the resulting methods. The text covers four main, interrelated topics:</p><ul><li><p>Probability and characterizations of random variables and random processes</p></li><li><p>Linear and nonlinear systems with random excitations</p></li><li><p>Optimum estimation theory including both the Wiener and Kalman Filters</p></li><li><p>Detection theory for both discrete and continuous time measurements</p></li></ul><p>Lucid, thorough, and well-stocked with numerous examples and practice problems that emphasize the concepts discussed, Random Processes: Filtering, Estimation, and Detection is an understandable and useful text ideal as both a self-study guide for professionals in the field and as a core text for graduate students.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>The idea that architecture can support change was described by Neal Ford, Rebecca Parsons, and Pat Kua in 2017 as evolutionary architecture. How do we enable this kind of evolution?</p><p>Architectural goals and constraints change independently of functional expectations. Fitness functions describe how close an architecture is to achieving an objective goal. During test-driven development, we write tests to verify that features conform to desired business outcomes; we can also write fitness functions that measure and monitor a system’s alignment to architectural goals as they evolve.</p><p>In order for technology to deliver lasting business value, it must be adaptable. Prose enterprise architecture standards or rigid architecture frameworks often don’t have the flexibility to support constant change. Regardless of application architectures (monolith, microservices, microkernel, etc.) or business architecture, fitness function–driven development can introduce continuous feedback for architectural conformance and inform the development process as it happens rather than after the fact.</p><p>Architecture can be expressed and tested as code, in a pipeline, in the same way we express and test business capability and infrastructure as code. The concept of architecture as code is a tremendous leap for most traditional architecture and development teams, challenging long-standing perceptions and mindsets.</p><p>Paula Paul and Cassandra Shum (ThoughtWorks) share adventures in the enterprise as they take architects and engineers on a journey toward fitness function–driven development, with real-world hurdles and unexpected insights, as they rethink the connection between architecture and business value in a digital world.</p></div></span></span>",

    "title": "How to Build Katacoda Scenarios with O'Reilly",
    "description": "If you are finding it hard to know where to start or how to get organized let me give you some tips. It's tempting and easy to start with Katacoda by starting to create and write each markdown file. That's the wrong place to start. Instead try following the phases to capture the evolution of your ideas. 1) open up a simple text file and just call it allsteps.md 2) Start with the core idea on why you want to write the scenario. What do you want to teach? Write it down as once sentence as the title enclose in # I want to show you how to use this new helpful tool called #. 3) From there write write just one line, simple phrases about what steps you want to complete to get to your goal. Preferably a verb with a noun. \"Create a file called example.yaml\" or \"Compile the new file\" or \"Open the dashboard and select the menu item labelled logs.\". 4) Now you have a rough storyboard on how to walk your student through your process. Don't try to make it perfect. 5) Open up a Katacoda playground the starts a machine that represents the environment that will support your scenario. 6) Try to follow your outline and see what commands work. Some may not work or you may have missed an important step. 7) Try to acheive your goal using all the commands you can think of. Note even those extra steps that does not include a command line event, such as editing text or opening up a web page and navigating to further actions. 8) If you are close then capture all of your commands with the Linux \"history\" command and pipe it to a file to send somewhere or dump to your clipboard. 9) Past these commands into your document, take out all the mistakes and distill to the bare essential commands. (try not to bundle multiple commands into one line, as it confuses first time learners, don't try to be too clever). 10) Merge yourline into the steps to previously outlined. Now you should have a pretty decent skeleton. Once the steps make sence and you have reduced them for less than a dozen you distinct steps you should be ready to break each step into a separate markdown file. It's OK to have more than one command in a step, just make sure they are all related to each other. Major transitions in thinking should indicate your should advance to the next step, like paragraphs when you are writing.",
