    "description": "<span><div><p>Want to tap the power behind search rankings, product recommendations, social bookmarking, and online matchmaking? This fascinating book demonstrates how you can build Web 2.0 applications to mine the enormous amount of data created by people on the Internet. With the sophisticated algorithms in this book, you can write smart programs to access interesting datasets from other web sites, collect data from users of your own applications, and analyze and understand the data once you've found it.<br/><br/><em>Programming Collective Intelligence</em> takes you into the world of machine learning and statistics, and explains how to draw conclusions about user experience, marketing, personal tastes, and human behavior in general -- all from information that you and others collect every day. Each algorithm is described clearly and concisely with code that can immediately be used on your web site, blog, Wiki, or specialized application. This book explains:</p><ul><li>Collaborative filtering techniques that enable online retailers to recommend products or media</li><li>Methods of clustering to detect groups of similar items in a large dataset</li><li>Search engine features -- crawlers, indexers, query engines, and the PageRank algorithm</li><li>Optimization algorithms that search millions of possible solutions to a problem and choose the best one</li><li>Bayesian filtering, used in spam filters for classifying documents based on word types and other features</li><li>Using decision trees not only to make predictions, but to model the way decisions are made</li><li>Predicting numerical values rather than classifications to build price models</li><li>Support vector machines to match people in online dating sites</li><li>Non-negative matrix factorization to find the independent features in a dataset</li><li>Evolving intelligence for problem solving -- how a computer develops its skill by improving its own code the more it plays a game</li></ul>Each chapter includes exercises for extending the algorithms to make them more powerful. Go beyond simple database-backed applications and put the wealth of Internet data to work for you.<br/><br/>\"Bravo! I cannot think of a better way for a developer to first learn these algorithms and methods, nor can I think of a better way for me (an old AI dog) to reinvigorate my knowledge of the details.\"<br/><br/>-- Dan Russell, Google<br/><br/>\"Toby's book does a great job of breaking down the complex subject matter of machine-learning algorithms into practical, easy-to-understand examples that can be directly applied to analysis of social interaction across the Web today.  If I had this book two years ago, it would have saved precious time going down some fruitless paths.\"<br/><br/>-- Tim Wolters, CTO, Collective Intellect</div></span>",

You've seen automated recommendations everywhere—on Netflix's home page, on YouTube, and on Amazon–as these machine learning algorithms learn about your unique interests, and show the best products or content for you as an individual. These technologies have become central to the largest, most prestigious tech employers out there, and by understanding how they work, you'll become very valuable to them. We cover tried-and-true recommendation algorithms based on neighborhood-based collaborative filtering and work our way up to more modern techniques including matrix factorization and even deep learning with artificial neural networks. Along the way, you'll learn from Kane's extensive industry experience and understand the real-world challenges you'll encounter when applying these algorithms at a large scale and with real-world data. The coding exercises in this course use the Python programming language. We include an intro to Python if you're new to it, but you'll need some prior programming experience in order to use this course successfully. We also include a short introduction to deep learning if you are new to the field of artificial intelligence, but you'll need to be able to understand new computer algorithms. Hope to see you in the course soon!</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p><strong>6 Hours of Video Instruction</strong></p><p>An intuitive introduction to the latest superhuman capabilities facilitated by Deep Learning.</p><p><strong>Overview</strong></p><p><strong>Machine Vision, GANs, Deep Reinforcement Learning LiveLessons</strong> is an introduction to three of the most exciting topics in Deep Learning today. Modern machine vision involves automated systems outperforming humans on image recognition, object detection, and image segmentation tasks. Generative Adversarial Networks cast two Deep Learning networks against each other in a “forger-detective” relationship, enabling the fabrication of stunning, photorealistic images with flexible, user-specifiable elements. Deep Reinforcement Learning has produced equally surprising advances, including the bulk of the most widely-publicized “artificial intelligence” breakthroughs. Deep RL involves training an “agent” to become adept in given “environments,” enabling algorithms to meet or surpass human-level performance on a diverse range of complex challenges, including Atari video games, the board game Go, and subtle hand-manipulation tasks. Throughout these lessons, essential theory is brought to life with intuitive explanations and interactive, hands-on Jupyter notebook demos. Examples feature Python and straightforward Keras layers in TensorFlow 2, the most popular Deep Learning library.</p><p><strong>About the Instructor</strong></p><p><strong>Jon Krohn</strong> is Chief Data Scientist at the machine learning company untapt. He presents a popular series of deep learning tutorials published by Addison-Wesley and is the author of the bestselling book <em>Deep Learning Illustrated</em>. Jon teaches his deep learning curriculum in-classroom at the New York City Data Science Academy, as well as guest lecturing at Columbia University and New York University. He holds a doctorate in neuroscience from Oxford University and has been publishing on machine learning in leading journals since 2010.</p><p><strong>Skill Level</strong></p><ul><li>Intermediate</li></ul><p><strong>Learn How To</strong></p><ul><li>Understand the high-level theory and key language around machine vision, deep reinforcement learning, and generative adversarial networks</li><li>Create state-of-the art models for image recognition, object detection, and image segmentation</li><li>Architect GANs that create convincing images in the style of human-drawn illustrations</li><li>Build deep RL agents that become adept at performing in a wide variety of environments, such as those provided by OpenAI Gym</li><li>Run automated experiments for optimizing deep reinforcement learning agent hyperparameters, such as its artificial-neural-network configuration</li><li>Appreciate what the current limitations of “artificial intelligence” are and how they may be overcome in the near future</li></ul><p><strong>Who Should Take This Course</strong></p><ul><li>Perfectly suited to software engineers, data scientists, analysts, and statisticians with an interest in applying Deep Learning to natural language data</li><li>Code examples are provided in Python, so familiarity with it or another object-oriented programming language would be helpful</li></ul><p><strong>Course Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>The author’s <em>Deep Learning with TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch LiveLessons</em>, or familiarity with the topics covered in Chapters 5 through 9 of his book <em>Deep Learning Illustrated</em>, are a prerequisite.</li></ul><p><strong>Lesson Descriptions</strong></p><p><strong>Lesson 1:  Orientation</strong><br/>\nLesson 1 starts with a quick review of how to run the code in the lessons. It then reviews the foundational deep learning theory that is essential for building machine vision, GANs, and deep reinforcement learning specializations. The lesson wraps up with a sneak peek at the cutting-edge capabilities that will be developed over the course of all five LiveLessons.</p><p><strong><strong>Lesson 2:</strong> Convolutional Neural Networks for Machine Vision</strong><br/>\nLesson 2 introduces convolutional layers. Convolutional layers are first used to create ConvNets in TensorFlow. The lesson then covers the gamut of machine learning applications, including residual networks, image segmentation, object detection, transfer learning, and capsule networks.</p><p><strong><strong>Lesson 3:</strong> Generative Adversarial Networks for Creativity</strong><br/>\nLesson 3 begins with the applications of and essential theory behind generative adversarial networks (GANs). You then are shown the Quick Draw! Game, which is used as a source of hundreds of thousands of hand-drawn images from a single class for a GAN to learn how to imitate. The rest of the lesson is spent developing the intricate code for the three primary components of a GAN: the discriminator network, the generator network, and the adversarial network that pits them against each other.</p><p><strong><strong>Lesson 4:</strong> Deep Reinforcement Learning</strong><br/>\nLesson 4 begins with a definition of deep reinforcement learning, then turns to an overview of its applications. The lesson wraps up with a discussion of the relationship of deep reinforcement learning to artificial intelligence.</p><p><strong>Lesson 5: Deep Q-Learning and Beyond</strong><br/>\nLesson 5 starts with the Cart-Pole game, which is used in the lesson to train the deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Then it turns to the theory behind deep reinforcement learning as well as deep Q-learning, a popular type of deep reinforcement learning agent.</p><p>With this theory under your belt you will be able to understand at an intuitive level the code that you subsequently when you define your own DQN agent and have it excel at the Cart-Pole game. The lesson wraps up by exploring a tool for optimizing deep reinforcement learning agent hyperparameters, introducing agents beyond DQN agents, outlining some possible project ideas, and return to the discussion of artificial intelligence to address the limitations of contemporary deep learning approaches.</p><p><strong>About Pearson Video Training</strong></p><p>Pearson publishes expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

The increase in demand for automation has generated many applications for AI in fields such as robotics, predictive analytics, finance, and more.\n</p><p>In this book, you will understand what artificial intelligence is. It explains in detail basic search methods: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and A* Search, which can be used to make intelligent decisions when the initial state, end state, and possible actions are known. Random solutions or greedy solutions can be found for such problems. But these are not optimal in either space or time and efficient approaches in time and space will be explored. We will also understand how to formulate a problem, which involves looking at it and identifying its initial state, goal state, and the actions that are possible in each state. We also need to understand the data structures involved while implementing these search algorithms as they form the basis of search exploration. Finally, we will look into what a heuristic is as this decides the quality of one sub-solution over another and helps you decide which step to take.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Understand the instances where searches can be used\n</li><li>Understand the algorithms that can be used to make decisions more intelligent\n</li><li>Formulate a problem by specifying its initial state, goal state, and actions\n</li><li>Translate the concepts of the selected search algorithm into code\n</li><li>Compare how basic search algorithms will perform for the application\n</li><li>Implement algorithmic programming using code examples</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book is for developers who are keen to get started with Artificial Intelligence and develop practical AI-based applications. Those developers who want to upgrade their normal applications to smart and intelligent versions will find this book useful. A basic knowledge and understanding of Python are assumed.</p></span>",

Lakhani show how reinventing the firm around data, analytics, and AI removes traditional constraints on scale, scope, and learning that have restricted business growth for hundreds of years. From Airbnb to Ant Financial, Microsoft to Amazon, research shows how AI-driven processes are vastly <i>more scalable</i> than traditional processes, allow massive <i>scope increase</i>, enabling companies to straddle industry boundaries, and create <i>powerful opportunities for learning</i>—to drive ever more accurate, complex, and sophisticated predictions.</p><p>When traditional operating constraints are removed, strategy becomes a whole new game, one whose rules and likely outcomes this book will make clear. Iansiti and Lakhani:</p><ul><li>Present a framework for rethinking business and operating models</li><li>Explain how \"collisions\" between AI-driven/digital and traditional/analog firms are reshaping competition, altering the structure of our economy, and forcing traditional companies to rearchitect their operating models</li><li>Explain the opportunities and risks created by digital firms</li><li>Describe the new challenges and responsibilities for the leaders of both digital and traditional firms</li></ul><p>Packed with examples—including many from the most powerful and innovative global, AI-driven competitors—and based on research in hundreds of firms across many sectors, this is your essential guide for rethinking how your firm competes and operates in the era of AI.</p></span>",

    "title": "AI for Game Developers",
    "description": "<span><div><p>Advances in 3D visualization and physics-based simulation technology make it possible for game developers to create compelling, visually immersive gaming environments that were only dreamed of years ago. But today's game players have grown in sophistication along with the games they play. It's no longer enough to wow your players with dazzling graphics; the next step in creating even more immersive games is improved artificial intelligence, or AI.Fortunately, advanced AI game techniques are within the grasp of every game developer--not just those who dedicate their careers to AI. If you're new to game programming or if you're an experienced game programmer who needs to get up to speed quickly on AI techniques, you'll find <i>AI for Game Developers</i> to be the perfect starting point for understanding and applying AI techniques to your games.Written for the novice AI programmer, <i>AI for Game Developers</i> introduces you to techniques such as finite state machines, fuzzy logic, neural networks, and many others, in straightforward, easy-to-understand language, supported with code samples throughout the entire book (written in C/C++). From basic techniques such as chasing and evading, pattern movement, and flocking to genetic algorithms, the book presents a mix of deterministic (traditional) and non-deterministic (newer) AI techniques aimed squarely at beginners AI developers. Other topics covered in the book include:</p><ul><li>Potential function based movements: a technique that handles chasing, evading swarming, and collision avoidance simultaneously</li><li>Basic pathfinding and waypoints, including an entire chapter devoted to the A* pathfinding algorithm</li><li>AI scripting</li><li>Rule-based AI: learn about variants other than fuzzy logic and finite state machines</li><li>Basic probability</li><li>Bayesian techniques</li></ul>Unlike other books on the subject, <i>AI for Game Developers</i> doesn't attempt to cover every aspect of game AI, but to provide you with usable, advanced techniques you can apply to your games right now.  If you've wanted to use AI to extend the play-life of your games, make them more challenging, and most importantly, make them more fun, then this book is for you.</div></span>",

    "description": "<span>\nConstraint satisfaction is a simple but powerful tool. Constraints identify the impossible and reduce the realm of possibilities to effectively focus on the possible, allowing for a natural declarative formulation of what must be satisfied, without expressing how. The field of constraint reasoning has matured over the last three decades with contributions from a diverse community of researchers in artificial intelligence, databases and programming languages, operations research, management science, and applied mathematics. Today, constraint problems are used to model cognitive tasks in vision, language comprehension, default reasoning, diagnosis, scheduling, temporal and spatial reasoning. <br/><br/>In <i>Constraint Processing</i>, Rina Dechter, synthesizes these contributions, along with her own significant work, to provide the first comprehensive examination of the theory that underlies constraint processing algorithms. Throughout, she focuses on fundamental tools and principles, emphasizing the representation and analysis of algorithms.<ul><li>Examines the basic practical aspects of each topic and then tackles more advanced issues, including current research challenges</li><li>Builds the reader's understanding with definitions, examples, theory, algorithms and complexity analysis</li><li>Synthesizes three decades of researchers work on constraint processing in AI, databases and programming languages, operations research, management science, and applied mathematics</li></ul>\n</span>",

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>Brands, marketers, and product designers need to understand their customers. Traditionally, market research was driven by surveys and focus groups of limited scale. Today, digital signals like web browsing behavior can provide a stream of observed behavioral data that is rich with information about a user’s interests, needs, and preferences. This type of data, coupled with machine learning techniques, holds the promise of freeing market research from the constraints of self-reported customer data.</p><p>In its raw state, web browsing data is both too detailed and too sparse to be comprehensible, let alone actionable. Melinda Han Williams (Dstillery) explores semantic embeddings as a novel approach for understanding observed digital consumer behavior and details how to use a semantic embedding of web browsing behavior to drive unsupervised clustering for customer segmentation. You’ll learn how Dstillery has trained a neural network on 15 billion behavioral interactions. The resulting model can be seen as a much lower dimensional embedding of the internet and, if projected into two or three dimensions, as an interactive map. This taxonomy of internet behavior can be used as the foundation for a number of applications, providing unparalleled insights into consumer behavior and needs.</p><p>This session was recorded at the 2019 O'Reilly Strata Data Conference in San Francisco.</p></div></span></span>",

    "description": "<span>\nReadings in Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering covers the main techniques and application of artificial intelligence and software engineering. The ultimate goal of artificial intelligence applied to software engineering is automatic programming. Automatic programming would allow a user to simply say what is wanted and have a program produced completely automatically. <br/>This book is organized into 11 parts encompassing 34 chapters that specifically tackle the topics of deductive synthesis, program transformations, program verification, and programming tutors. The opening parts provide an introduction to the key ideas to the deductive approach, namely the correspondence between theorems and specifications and between constructive proofs and programs. These parts also describes automatic theorem provers whose development has be designed for the programming domain. The subsequent parts present generalized program transformation systems, the problems involved in using natural language input, the features of very high level languages, and the advantages of the programming by example system. Other parts explore the intelligent assistant approach and the significance and relation of programming knowledge in other programming system. The concluding parts focus on the features of the domain knowledge system and the artificial intelligence programming. <br/>Software engineers and designers and computer programmers, as well as researchers in the field of artificial intelligence will find this book invaluable.\n</span>",

While these two artificial entities do not exist, the algorithms of AI have been able to address many real issues, from performing medical diagnoses to navigating difficult terrain to monitoring possible failures of spacecrafts. Exploring these algorithms and applications, <strong>Contemporary Artificial Intelligence</strong> presents strong AI methods and algorithms for solving challenging problems involving systems that behave intelligently in specialized domains such as medical and software diagnostics, financial decision making, speech and text recognition, genetic analysis, and more. </p><p/><p>One of the first AI texts accessible to students, the book focuses on the most useful problem-solving strategies that have emerged from AI. In a student-friendly way, the authors cover logic-based methods; probability-based methods; emergent intelligence, including evolutionary computation and swarm intelligence; data-derived logical and probabilistic learning models; and natural language understanding. Through reading this book, students discover the importance of AI techniques in computer science.</p></span></span>",

While a large amount of information exists scattered throughout various media (books, journal articles, webpages, etc.), the diffuse nature of these sources is problematic and logic as a topic benefits from a unified approach. Logic for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence utilizes this format, surveying the tableaux, resolution, Davis and Putnam methods, logic programming, as well as for example unification and subsumption. For non-classical logics, the translation method is detailed.</p><p>Logic for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence is the classroom-tested result of several years of teaching at Grenoble INP (Ensimag). It is conceived to allow self-instruction for a beginner with basic knowledge in Mathematics and Computer Science, but is also highly suitable for use in traditional courses. The reader is guided by clearly motivated concepts, introductions, historical remarks, side notes concerning connections with other disciplines, and numerous exercises, complete with detailed solutions, The title provides the reader with the tools needed to arrive naturally at practical implementations of the concepts and techniques discussed, allowing for the design of algorithms to solve problems.</p></span></span></span>",

As AI and ML eat software, more and more PMs and execs need to level up their skills to manage these products and provide requirements and specifications that add value to the data engineering and data science teams.

    "description": "<span><p><b>\"What does AI mean for your business? Read this book to find out.\" -- Hal Varian, Chief Economist, Google</b></p><p>Artificial intelligence does the seemingly impossible, magically bringing machines to life--driving cars, trading stocks, and teaching children. But facing the sea change that AI will bring can be paralyzing. How should companies set strategies, governments design policies, and people plan their lives for a world so different from what we know? In the face of such uncertainty, many analysts either cower in fear or predict an impossibly sunny future.</p><p>But in <i>Prediction Machines</i>, three eminent economists recast the rise of AI as a drop in the cost of prediction. With this single, masterful stroke, they lift the curtain on the AI-is-magic hype and show how basic tools from economics provide clarity about the AI revolution and a basis for action by CEOs, managers, policy makers, investors, and entrepreneurs.</p><p>When AI is framed as cheap prediction, its extraordinary potential becomes clear:</p><ul><li>Prediction is at the heart of making decisions under uncertainty. Our businesses and personal lives are riddled with such decisions.</li><li>Prediction tools increase productivity--operating machines, handling documents, communicating with customers.</li><li>Uncertainty constrains strategy. Better prediction creates opportunities for new business structures and strategies to compete.</li></ul><p>Penetrating, fun, and always insightful and practical, <i>Prediction Machines</i> follows its inescapable logic to explain how to navigate the changes on the horizon. The impact of AI will be profound, but the economic framework for understanding it is surprisingly simple.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><i>Formal Verification: An Essential Toolkit for Modern VLSI Design</i> presents practical approaches for design and validation, with hands-on advice to help working engineers integrate these techniques into their work. Formal Verification (FV) enables a designer to directly analyze and mathematically explore the quality or other aspects of a Register Transfer Level (RTL) design without using simulations. This can reduce time spent validating designs and more quickly reach a final design for manufacturing. Building on a basic knowledge of SystemVerilog, this book demystifies FV and presents the practical applications that are bringing it into mainstream design and validation processes at Intel and other companies. After reading this book, readers will be prepared to introduce FV in their organization and effectively deploy FV techniques to increase design and validation productivity.</p><ul><li>Learn formal verification algorithms to gain full coverage without exhaustive simulation</li><li>Understand formal verification tools and how they differ from simulation tools</li><li>Create instant test benches to gain insight into how models work and find initial bugs</li><li>Learn from Intel insiders sharing their hard-won knowledge and solutions to complex design problems</li></ul></span>",

It is intended for first-year graduate students who have some familiarity with probability and random variables, though not necessarily of random processes and systems that operate on random signals. It is also appropriate for advanced undergraduate students who have a strong mathematical background.</p><p>The book has the following features:</p><li><p>Several appendices include related material on integration, important inequalities and identities, frequency-domain transforms, and linear algebra. These topics have been included so that the book is relatively self-contained. One appendix contains an extensive summary of 33 random variables and their properties such as moments, characteristic functions, and entropy.</p></li><li><p>Unlike most books on probability, numerous figures have been included to clarify and expand upon important points. Over 600 illustrations and MATLAB plots have been designed to reinforce the material and illustrate the various characterizations and properties of random quantities.</p></li><li><p>Sufficient statistics are covered in detail, as is their connection to parameter estimation techniques. These include classical Bayesian estimation and several optimality criteria: mean-square error, mean-absolute error, maximum likelihood, method of moments, and least squares.</p></li><li><p>The last four chapters provide an introduction to several topics usually studied in subsequent engineering courses: communication systems and information theory; optimal filtering (Wiener and Kalman); adaptive filtering (FIR and IIR); and antenna beamforming, channel equalization, and direction finding. This material is available electronically at the companion website.</p></li><p><em>Probability, Random Variables, and Random Processes</em> is the only textbook on probability for engineers that includes relevant background material, provides extensive summaries of key results, and extends various statistical techniques to a range of applications in signal processing.</p><p><b>Note: The ebook version does not provide access to the companion files.</b></p></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Based on extensive ethnographic and quantitative research, conducted in Ukraine and Russia between 2004 and 2012, this book’s central argument is that for many people the informal economy, such as cash in hand work, subsistence production and the use of social networks, is of great importance to everyday life. Formal work is both a facilitator of such processes and is often supported by them, as people can only afford to undertake low paid formal work as a result of their informal incomes. By looking at the informal nature of formal work and practices, informal practices, gift giving, volunteer work and the economies of the household the book is one of the first to give an overview of the nature of the informal economy in all spheres of everyday practice. </p></span>",

A wealth of programming-like examples and easy-to-follow explanations build the general theory gradually, which guides readers through the modeling and mathematical analysis of computational phenomena and provides insights on what makes things tick and also what restrains the ability of computational processes.</p><p>Recognizing the importance of acquired practical experience, the book begins with the metatheory of general purpose computer programs, using URMs as a straightforward, technology-independent model of modern high-level programming languages while also exploring the restrictions of the URM language. Once readers gain an understanding of computability theory—including the primitive recursive functions—the author presents automata and languages, covering the regular and context-free languages as well as the machines that recognize these languages. Several advanced topics such as reducibilities, the recursion theorem, complexity theory, and Cook's theorem are also discussed. Features of the book include:</p><li><p>A review of basic discrete mathematics, covering logic and induction while omitting specialized combinatorial topics</p></li><li><p>A thorough development of the modeling and mathematical analysis of computational phenomena, providing a solid foundation of un-computability</p></li><li><p>The connection between un-computability and un-provability: Gödel's first incompleteness theorem</p></li><p>The book provides numerous examples of specific URMs as well as other programming languages including Loop Programs, FA (Deterministic Finite Automata), NFA (Nondeterministic Finite Automata), and PDA (Pushdown Automata). Exercises at the end of each chapter allow readers to test their comprehension of the presented material, and an extensive bibliography suggests resources for further study.</p><p>Assuming only a basic understanding of general computer programming and discrete mathematics, <em>Theory of Computation</em> serves as a valuable book for courses on theory of computation at the upper-undergraduate level. The book also serves as an excellent resource for programmers and computing professionals wishing to understand the theoretical limitations of their craft.</p></span></span></span></span>",

The author structured it in such a way that each section will handle one major part of the course. </p><p>Introduction: This is where we'll explain how the game works, it's various features and what we'll be using to achieve the same results. </p><p>Module 1: We'll explain the basics of artificial intelligence and it's various terminologies. We'll put the ground work you'll need to understand the further concepts explained in this course. </p><p>Module 2: We'll explain what the MiniMax alrogithm is and how it's implemented. We'll use pictorical and graphical representation to explain the concept with 2 detailed examples. We'll also explain the Pseudocode of the algorithm. </p><p>Module 3: We'll explain how the MiniMax algorithm can be implemented in creating an artificial intelligence based player (computer player) for a Tic Tac Toe game. We'll explain the concept with another pictorial representation of the entire process. </p><p>Module 4: We'll delve into Javascript and HTML5 canvas concepts that are related to the project we'll be creating. </p><p>Module 5: We'll be teaching you how to create the bare bones of the app with HTML5. The result will be a page with all the elements we need in our game, devoid any colors or design elements. After that, we'll \"beautify\" our app. We'll be using CSS elements to give our game colors and styles. At the end of this module, we'll have a Tic Tac Toe web game that'll look like the final result, albeit one that is not playable yet. </p><p>Module 6: We'll introduce a step by step algorithm that explains what we'll be doing while creating the Javascript part of our code.</p><p>Module 7: We'll be delving into Javascript &amp; HTML5 canvas code of our game in this module, and we'll teach you how to make the game playable (let the user draw on the canvas and display the game results) in here. In this part, we'll create the necessary code to make the human player play the game on the app. </p><p>Module 8: This would be the meat of the course. In this module, we'll be applying the MiniMax algorithm with relevant Javascript code to create an artificial intelligence that can play against the human player (the web user). </p><p>All the code files are placed at https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Artificial-intelligence-in-Game-development---Tic-Tac-Toe-AI</p><p>Downloading the example code for this course: You can download the example code files for all Packt video courses you have purchased from your account at <a href=\"http://www.PacktPub.com\">http://www.PacktPub.com</a>.

    "title": "Towards Sustainable Artificial Intelligence: A Framework to Create Value and Understand Risk",
    "description": "<span><p>So far, little effort has been devoted to developing practical approaches on how to develop and deploy AI systems that meet certain standards and principles. This is despite the importance of principles such as privacy, fairness, and social equality taking centre stage in discussions around AI. However, for an organization, failing to meet those standards can give rise to significant lost opportunities. It may further lead to an organization’s demise, as the example of Cambridge Analytica demonstrates. It is, however, possible to pursue a practical approach for the design, development, and deployment of sustainable AI systems that incorporates both business and human values and principles.</p>\n\nThis book discusses the concept of sustainability in the context of artificial intelligence. In order to help businesses achieve this objective, the author introduces the sustainable artificial intelligence framework (SAIF), designed as a reference guide in the development and deployment of AI systems.<p></p>\n<p>The SAIF developed in the book is designed to help decision makers such as policy makers, boards, C-suites, managers, and data scientists create AI systems that meet ethical principles. By focusing on four pillars related to the socio-economic and political impact of AI, the SAIF creates an environment through which an organization learns to understand its risk and exposure to any undesired consequences of AI, and the impact of AI on its ability to create value in the short, medium, and long term.   </p>\n<p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p>\n<ul><li>See the relevance of ethics      to the practice of data science and AI</li><li>Examine the elements that      enable AI within an organization</li><li>Discover the challenges of      developing AI systems that meet certain human or specific standards</li><li>Explore the challenges of AI      governance</li><li>Absorb the key factors to      consider when evaluating AI systems</li></ul> <p><b>Who This Book Is For</b> </p>\n\nDecision makers such as government officials, members of the C-suite and other business managers, and data scientists as well as any technology expert aspiring to a data-related leadership role. <br/><br/></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>Millions of non-technical professionals and leaders want to understand Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) — whether to improve their businesses, be more effective citizens, consumers or policymakers, or just out of sheer curiosity. Until now, most books on the subject have either been too complicated and mathematical, or have simply avoided the big picture by focusing on the use of specific software libraries. In <b><i>Artificial Intelligence for Business</i></b>, Doug Rose bridges the gap, offering today’s most accessible and useful introduction to AI and ML technologies — and what they can and can’t do.</p><p>Rose begins by tracing AI’s evolution from the early 1950s to the present, illuminating core ideas that still drive its development. Next, he explores recent innovations that have reinvigorated the field by providing the “big data” that makes machine learning so powerful – innovations such as GPS, social media and electronic transactions. Finally, he explains how today’s machines learn by combining powerful processing, advanced algorithms, and artificial neural networks that mimic the human brain.</p><p>Throughout, he illustrates key concepts with practical examples that help you connect AI, ML, and neural networks to specific problems and solutions. Step by step, he systematically demystifies these powerful technologies, removing the fear, bewilderment, and advanced math — so you can understand the new possibilities they create, and start using them.</p></div></span>",

AI is poised to completely transform asset management and investment banking, yet its current application within the financial sector is limited and fragmented. Existing AI implementations tend to solve very narrow business issues, rather than serving as a powerful tech framework for next-generation finance. Artificial Intelligence for Asset Management and Investment provides a strategic viewpoint on how AI can be comprehensively integrated within investment finance.</p>\n\n<p>No other book on the market takes such a wide-ranging approach to using AI in asset management. With this guide, you'll be able to build an asset management firm from the ground up-or revolutionize your existing firm-using artificial intelligence as the cornerstone and foundation. This is a must, because AI is quickly growing to be the single competitive factor for financial firms. With better AI comes better results.</p>\n\n<p>Until now, it has been prohibitively difficult to map the high-tech world of AI onto complex and ever-changing financial markets. Artificial Intelligence for Asset Management and Investment makes this difficulty a thing of the past, providing you with a professional and accessible framework for setting up and running artificial intelligence in your financial operations.</p></span>",

Specific methodologies are introduced to help with finding critical training data within an organization and how to fill data gaps if they exist. With data in hand, a scoped prototype can be built to limit risk and provide tangible value to the organization as a whole to justify further investment. Finally, a production level AI system can be developed with best practices to ensure quality with not only the application code, but also the AI models. Finally, with this particular AI adoption journey at an end, the authors will show that there is additional value to be gained by iterating on this AI adoption lifecycle and improving other parts of the organization.</p></span>",

    "title": "Hacking Artificial Intelligence",
    "description": "<span><p>We are accelerating towards the automated future. But this new future brings new risks. It is no surprise that after years of development and recent breakthroughs, artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming businesses, consumer electronics, and the national security landscape. But like all digital technologies, AI can fail and be left vulnerable to hacking. The ability to hack AI and the technology industry's lack of effort to secure it is thought by experts to be the biggest unaddressed technology issue of our time. Hacking Artificial Intelligence sheds light on these hacking risks, explaining them to those who can make a difference.</p>\n\n<p>Today, very few people-including those in influential business and government positions-are aware of the new risks that accompany automated systems. While society hurdles ahead with AI, we are also rushing towards a security and safety nightmare. This book is the first-ever layman's guide to the new world of hacking AI and introduces the field to thousands of people who should be aware of these risks. From a security perspective, AI is today where the internet was thirty years ago. It is wide open and can be exploited. Listeners from leaders to AI enthusiasts and practitioners alike are shown how AI hacking is a real risk to organizations and are provided with a framework to assess such risks, before problems arise.</p></span>",

Eventually it may alter how we see our place in the universe, as machines pursue goals independent of their creators and outperform us in domains previously believed to be the sole dominion of humans. Whether we regard them as conscious or unwitting, revere them as a new form of life or dismiss them as mere clever appliances, is beside the point. They are likely to play an increasingly critical and intimate role in many aspects of our lives.</p>\n\n<p>The emergence of systems capable of independent reasoning and action raises serious questions about just whose interests they are permitted to serve, and what limits our society should place on their creation and use.

Today it’s sexy again, and that far-off future of intelligent bots is just around the corner. Consider the latest trend, AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS). Software vendors such as Google, IBM, and Amazon are rolling out sophisticated cloud-based AI and machine-learning services for a growing market of developers and users in business and academia.</p><p>Through interviews with consumers and executives of AIaaS vendors, author Mike Barlow examines the primary driver of this new approach: AI is simply too big for any single device or system. But with AIaaS, developers can build applications that perform data collection and compression on devices, while advanced processes such as natural language processing and machine learning are performed in the cloud.</p><p>When will consumers feel the impact?

If you do, what should you know before making it?This book introduces the reader to the pitfalls and promises of artificial intelligence (AI) in its modern incarnation and the growing trend of systems to \"reach off the Web\" into the real world. The convergence of AI, social networking, and modern computing is creating an historic inflection point in the partnership between human beings and machines with potentially profound impacts on the future not only of computing but of our world and species.AI experts and researchers James Hendler—co-originator of the Semantic Web (Web 3.0)—and Alice Mulvehill—developer of AI-based operational systems for DARPA, the Air Force, and NASA—explore the social implications of AI systems in the context of a close examination of the technologies that make them possible. The authors critically evaluate the utopian claims and dystopian counterclaims of AI prognosticators. <i>Social Machines: The Coming Collision of Artificial Intelligence, Social Networking, and Humanity</i> is your richly illustrated field guide to the future of your machine-mediated relationships with other human beings and with increasingly intelligent machines.</p><p>What Readers Will Learn</p><ul><li>What the concept of a social machine is and how the activities of non-programmers are contributing to machine intelligence</li><li>How modern artificial intelligence technologies, such as Watson, are evolving and how they process knowledge from both carefully produced information (such as Wikipedia and journal articles) and from big data collections</li><li>The fundamentals of neuromorphic computing, knowledge graph search, and linked data, as well as the basic technology concepts that underlie networking applications such as Facebook and Twitter</li><li>How the change in attitudes towards cooperative work on the Web, especially in the younger demographic, is critical to the future of Web applications</li></ul><p>Who This Book Is For</p><p>General readers and technically engaged developers, entrepreneurs, and technologists interested in the threats and promises of the accelerating convergence of artificial intelligence with social networks and mobile web technologies.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>The past decade has witnessed a wide adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) technologies. However, a lack of oversight into their widespread implementation has resulted in harmful outcomes that could have been avoided with proper oversight. Before we can realize AI/ML's true benefit, practitioners must understand how to mitigate its risks. This book describes responsible AI, a holistic approach for improving AI/ML technology, business processes, and cultural competencies that builds on best practices in risk management, cybersecurity, data privacy, and applied social science.</p><p>It's an ambitious undertaking that requires a diverse set of talents, experiences, and perspectives. Data scientists and nontechnical oversight folks alike need to be recruited and empowered to audit and evaluate high-impact AI/ML systems. Author Patrick Hall created this guide for a new generation of auditors and assessors who want to make AI systems better for organizations, consumers, and the public at large.</p><ul><li>Learn how to create a successful and impactful responsible AI practice</li><li>Get a guide to existing standards, laws, and assessments for adopting AI technologies</li><li>Look at how existing roles at companies are evolving to incorporate responsible AI</li><li>Examine business best practices and recommendations for implementing responsible AI</li><li>Learn technical approaches for responsible AI at all stages of system development</li></ul></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><br>Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence contains the proceedings of the Ninth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence held at the Catholic University of America in Washington, DC, on July 9-11, 1993. The papers focus on methods of reasoning and decision making under uncertainty as applied to problems in artificial intelligence (AI) and cover topics ranging from knowledge acquisition and automated model construction to learning, planning, temporal reasoning, and machine vision.  Comprised of 66 chapters, this book begins with a discussion on causality in Bayesian belief networks before turning to a decision theoretic account of conditional ought statements that rectifies glaring deficiencies in classical deontic logic and forms a sound basis for qualitative decision theory. Subsequent chapters explore trade-offs in constructing and evaluating temporal influence diagrams; normative engineering risk management systems; additive belief-network models; and sensitivity analysis for probability assessments in Bayesian networks. Automated model construction and learning as well as algorithms for inference and decision making are also considered.  This monograph will be of interest to both students and practitioners in the fields of AI and computer science.<br></p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Most artificial intelligence research investigates intelligent behavior for a single agent--solving problems heuristically, understanding natural language, and so on. Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) is concerned with coordinated intelligent behavior: intelligent agents coordinating their knowledge, skills, and plans to act or solve problems, working toward a single goal, or toward separate, individual goals that interact. DAI provides intellectual insights about organization, interaction, and problem solving among intelligent agents.  This comprehensive collection of articles shows the breadth and depth of DAI research. The selected information is relevant to emerging DAI technologies as well as to practical problems in artificial intelligence, distributed computing systems, and human-computer interaction. </p><p>\"Readings in Distributed Artificial Intelligence\" proposes a framework for understanding the problems and possibilities of DAI. It divides the study into three realms: the natural systems approach (emulating strategies and representations people use to coordinate their activities), the engineering/science perspective (building automated, coordinated problem solvers for specific applications), and a third, hybrid approach that is useful in analyzing and developing mixed collections of machines and human agents working together. </p><p>The editors introduce the volume with an important survey of the motivations, research, and results of work in DAI. This historical and conceptual overview combines with chapter introductions to guide the reader through this fascinating field. A unique and extensive bibliography is also provided.</p></span>",

This eight-chapter book aims to explain these ideas of AI that can be used to produce programs on microcomputers. <br/>After providing an overview of the concept of AI, this book goes on examining the features and difficulties of a heuristic solution in a wide range of human problems. The discussion then shifts to the application of a heuristic solution to a two-ply search program for a two-person game. The following chapters are devoted to the other components of AI, including the expert systems, memory structure, pattern recognition, and language. The concluding chapter deals with the alternative and auxiliary approaches to the study of AI and its practical applications. <br/>Computer scientists and programmers will find this work invaluable.\n</span>",

In this book you will unpack how these powerful models are created from relatively simple building blocks, and how you might adapt these models to your own use cases.</p><p>You will begin by setting up clean containerized environments for Python and getting to grips with the fundamentals of deep neural networks, learning about core concepts like the perceptron, activation functions, backpropagation, and how they all tie together. Once you have covered the basics, you will explore deep generative models in depth, including OpenAI's GPT-series of news generators, networks for style transfer and deepfakes, and synergy with reinforcement learning.</p><p>As you progress, you will focus on abstractions where useful, and understand the “nuts and bolts” of how the models are composed in code, underpinned by detailed architecture diagrams. The book concludes with a variety of practical projects to generate music, images, text, and speech using the methods you have learned in prior sections, piecing together TensorFlow layers, utility functions, and training loops to uncover links between the different modes of generation.</p><p>By the end of this book, you will have acquired the knowledge to create and implement your own generative AI models.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Implement paired and unpaired style transfer with networks like StyleGAN</li><li>Use facial landmarks, autoencoders, and pix2pix GAN to create deepfakes</li><li>Build several text generation pipelines based on LSTMs, BERT, and GPT-2, learning how attention and transformers changed the NLP landscape</li><li>Compose music using LSTM models, simple generative adversarial networks, and the intricate MuseGAN</li><li>Train a deep learning agent to move through a simulated physical environment</li><li>Discover emerging applications of generative AI, such as folding proteins and creating videos from images</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book will appeal to Python programmers, seasoned modelers, and machine learning engineers who are keen to learn about the creation and implementation of generative models. To make the most out of this book, you should have a basic familiarity with probability theory, linear algebra, and deep learning.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) in its various forms –– machine learning, chatbots, robots, agents, etc. –– is increasingly being seen as a core component of enterprise business workflow and information management systems. The current promise and hype around AI are being driven by software vendors, academic research projects, and startups. However, we posit that the greatest promise and potential for AI lies in the enterprise with its applications touching all organizational facets.</p><p>With increasing business process and workflow maturity, coupled with recent trends in cloud computing, datafication, IoT, cybersecurity, and advanced analytics, there is an understanding that the challenges of tomorrow cannot be solely addressed by today’s people, processes, and products. </p><p>There is still considerable mystery, hype, and fear about AI in today’s world. A considerable amount of current discourse focuses on a dystopian future that could adversely affect humanity. Such opinions, with understandable fear of the unknown, don’t consider the history of human innovation, the current state of business and technology, or the primarily augmentative nature of tomorrow’s AI.</p><p>This book demystifies AI for the enterprise. It takes readers from the basics (definitions, state-of-the-art, etc.) to a multi-industry journey, and concludes with expert advice on everything an organization must do to succeed. Along the way, we debunk myths, provide practical pointers, and include best practices with applicable vignettes. </p><p>AI brings to enterprise the capabilities that promise new ways by which professionals can address both mundane and interesting challenges more efficiently, effectively, and collaboratively (with humans). The opportunity for tomorrow’s enterprise is to augment existing teams and resources with the power of AI in order to gain competitive advantage, discover new business models, establish or optimize new revenues, and achieve better customer and user satisfaction.</p></span>",

    "title": "Practical AI for Healthcare Professionals: Machine Learning with Numpy, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow",
    "description": "<span><p><b>Practical AI for Healthcare Professionals</b></p><p><b> </b></p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a buzzword in the healthcare sphere today. However, notions of what AI actually is and how it works are often not discussed. Furthermore, information on AI implementation is often tailored towards seasoned programmers rather than the healthcare professional/beginner coder. This book gives an introduction to practical AI in the medical sphere, focusing on real-life clinical problems, how to solve them with actual code, and how to evaluate the efficacy of those solutions. You’ll start by learning how to diagnose problems as ones that can and cannot be solved with AI. You’ll then learn the basics of computer science algorithms, neural networks, and when each should be applied. Then you’ll tackle the essential parts of basic Python programming relevant to data processing and making AI programs. The Tensorflow/Keras library along with Numpy and Scikit-Learn are covered as well.<p></p><p> </p><p>Once you’ve mastered those basic computer science and programming concepts, you can dive into projects with code, implementation details, and explanations. These projects give you the chance to explore using machine learning algorithms for issues such as predicting the probability of hospital admission from emergency room triage and patient demographic data. We will then use deep learning to determine whether patients have pneumonia using chest X-Ray images.</p><p> </p>The topics covered in this book not only encompass areas of the medical field where AI is already playing a major role, but also are engineered to cover as much as possible of AI that is relevant to medical diagnostics. Along the way, readers can expect to learn data processing, how to conceptualize problems that can be solved by AI, and how to program solutions to those problems. Physicians and other healthcare professionals who can master these skills will be able to lead AI-based research and diagnostic tool development, ultimately benefiting countless patients.</span>",

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>Across industry sectors, both management and leaders see a yawning gap between the promised and delivered impact of data science projects and wonder why the discrepancy exists. It's simple, really. Companies rely on highly skilled and expensive data scientists to help them build predictive capabilities into their products and workflows, but they often think the data science team alone can lead the change.</p><p>This report examines issues from several conversations the authors held with data science teams across industries, as well as those issues they've witnessed in their own experience as builders and leaders. Among their findings, the authors agreed that to shorten the production process, lower overhead, and reduce risk, organizations need a comprehensive understanding of how to build AI in a repeatable fashion.</p><p>Technologists John J. Thomas, Paco Nathan, and William Roberts show data scientists how an organization and its technology work together to support their mission. Leaders of data science teams will examine how their organizations can transparently and seamlessly facilitate the delivery of data products. And business leaders will learn the value, both realized and potential, of introducing data science expertise in their organizations.</p></div></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><b>Creating Transparent AI</b></p><p>From agriculture to transportation, entertainment to medicine, and banking to social media, artificial intelligence (AI) is changing how humans do practically everything. We experience AI in our daily lives through our fitness trackers, home digital assistant systems, and curated news services, to name a few examples. For talent development, this is no different.</p><p>The fields of artificial intelligence and talent development have been on a collision course for decades, and their convergence has already occurred. It has just taken many in our profession some time to recognize this fact. On the horizon, AI-powered innovations are transforming the workplace and the role of the talent development professional, affecting recruiting to training to compensation. As such, there are actions TD professionals should take now to prepare ourselves and our organizations for the evolving AI revolution.</p><p>In <em>AI in Talent Development,</em> Margie Meacham describes the benefits, uses, and risks of AI technology and offers practical tools to strengthen and enhance learning and performance programs. In layman’s terms, Meacham demonstrates how we can free time for ourselves by employing a useful robot “assistant,” create a chatbot for specific tasks (such as a new manager bot, a sales coach bot, or new employee onboarding bot), and build personalized coaching tools from AI-processed big data. She concludes each of the six chapters with helpful tips and includes a resource guide with planning tools, templates, and worksheets.</p><p>Meacham dispels fear of AI’s black box—the term used to describe its unknowability and opacity—and points out ways AI can help us be better at creativity and critical thinking, what we humans do best.</p></span>",

With the rapid advance of technology, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are being effectively used in the fields of health to improve the efficiency of treatments, avoid the risk of false diagnoses, make therapeutic decisions, and predict the outcome in many clinical scenarios. Modern health treatments are faced with the challenge of acquiring, analyzing and applying the large amount of knowledge necessary to solve complex problems. Computational intelligence in healthcare mainly uses computer techniques to perform clinical diagnoses and suggest treatments. In the present scenario of computing, CI tools present adaptive mechanisms that permit the understanding of data in difficult and changing environments. The desired results of CI technologies profit medical fields by assembling patients with the same types of diseases or fitness problems so that healthcare facilities can provide effectual treatments. </p><p>This book starts with the fundamentals of computer intelligence and the techniques and procedures associated with it. Contained in this book are state-of-the-art methods of computational intelligence and other allied techniques used in the healthcare system, as well as advances in different CI methods that will confront the problem of effective data analysis and storage faced by healthcare institutions. The objective of this book is to provide researchers with a platform encompassing state-of-the-art innovations; research and design; implementation of methodological and algorithmic solutions to data processing problems; and the design and analysis of evolving trends in health informatics, intelligent disease prediction and computer-aided diagnosis. </p><p><b>Audience </b></p><p>The book is of interest to artificial intelligence and biomedical scientists, researchers, engineers and students in various settings such as pharmaceutical &amp; biotechnology companies, virtual assistants developing companies, medical imaging &amp; diagnostics centers, wearable device designers, healthcare assistance robot manufacturers, precision medicine testers, hospital management, and researchers working in healthcare system.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><b>Lead your organization to become evidence-driven</b><br/><br/>\nData. It’s the benchmark that informs corporate projections, decision-making, and analysis. But, why do many organizations that see themselves as data-driven fail to thrive? In Leading with AI and Analytics, two renowned experts from the Kellogg School of Management show business leaders how to transform their organization to become evidence-driven, which leads to real, measurable changes that can help propel their companies to the top of their industries.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe availability of unprecedented technology-enabled tools has made AI (Artificial Intelligence) an essential component of business analytics. But what’s often lacking are the leadership skills to integrate these technologies to achieve maximum value. Here, the authors provide a comprehensive game plan for developing that all-important human factor to get at the heart of data science: the ability to apply analytical thinking to real-world problems.

James Wilson showed how leading organizations use the power of human-machine collaboration to transform their businesses and their bottom lines. Now those companies and other pioneers across industries are reshaping the very nature of innovation.</p>\n\n<p>In Radically Human, Daugherty and Wilson show this profound shift-how artificial intelligence is becoming less artificial and more intelligent. How, instead of data-hungry approaches to AI, innovators are pursuing data-efficient approaches that enable machines to learn as humans do. And how, instead of replacing workers with machines, they are unleashing human expertise to create human-centered AI.</p>\n\n<p>Leading companies use these fresh approaches to the basic building blocks of business-Intelligence, Data, Experience, Architecture, and Strategy (IDEAS)-to transform competition, optimize post-pandemic approaches to work and talent, and show the way toward a sustainable future. With compelling insights and fresh examples from a variety of industries, Radically Human will forever change the way you think about, practice, and win with innovation.<br></p></span>",

In this book, he walks you through real-world landscape and portrait edits, and covers every tool and feature with the goal of helping you understand how to make Luminar improve your images. <p/>\n\nIn this book you’ll learn all about:<p/>\n<ul>• <b>AI editing:</b> Luminar AI’s many AI-based tools eliminate hours of traditional editing tasks. Improve overall tone and color using just one slider, and enhance a sky using another without building masks or layers. Realistically replace the entire sky in one step, even when objects like buildings or trees intrude. Luminar identifies people in photos, allowing you to smooth skin, sharpen eyes, brighten faces, and perform other portrait retouching tasks in minutes.</ul>\n<ul>• <b>AI Templates</b> Luminar recommends templates based on the content of your photo, and has scores of other templates to apply quick fixes and stylish looks. Templates are also a powerful way to save your own editing adjustments, saving you time and ensuring consistent results across dozens or hundreds of photos.</ul>\n<ul>• <b>Expert editing:</b> Take advantage of Luminar’s many professional tools to bring out the best versions of your photos. Enhance the look using tone controls and curves, dodging and burning, and tools built for specific types of images, such as Landscape Enhancer, Atmosphere AI, Supercontrast, and Color Harmony. The Erase and Clone &amp; Stamp tools make it easy to remove unexpected objects and glitches such as lens dust spots. Luminar’s RAW editing engine includes real-time noise reduction and advanced color processing and sharpening\ntools, all completely non-destructive and with the ability to step back through the history of edits.</ul>\n<ul>• <b>Advanced editing:</b> Luminar AI's Local Masking tool is one of its secret weapons, which can be used to combine edits and effects. Most tools can also have their own masks, giving you control over where edits are applied within the image.</ul>\n<ul>• <b>Creativity: </b>Open your imagination with Luminar’s creative tools, which range from adding glow, texture, and dramatic looks to incorporating sunrays and objects into augmented skies. Learn how to use LUTs (Lookup Tables) in the Mood tool to bring the look of simulated film stocks and creative color grades to your work. </ul>\n<ul>• <b>Luminar Library:</b> Organize and manage your photos in a central library where your source images can reside where you want them, whether that’s on your hard disk, a network volume, or in local cloud services folders such as Dropbox or Google Drive for remote backup.</ul>\n<ul>• <b>Luminar plug-ins:</b> If you already use other applications to organize your library or for photo editing, such as Adobe Photoshop or Lightroom Classic, Luminar AI also works as a plug-in that allows round-trip editing and seamless integration with the workflows you may already have in place.</ul>\n<ul>• <b>Sharing images:</b> Whether you’re printing your images or sharing them online, learn how to make your photos look their best no matter what output solution you need.</ul>\n\n  </span>",

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>\n                The concepts of “undesired bias” and “black box models” in machine learning have become a highly discussed topic due to the numerous high profile incidents that have been covered by the media. It’s certainly a challenging topic, as it could even be said that the concept of societal bias is inherently biased in itself, depending on an individual’s (or group’s) perspective.\n            </p><p>\n                Alejandro Saucedo (The Institute for Ethical AI &amp; Machine Learning) doesn’t reinvent the wheel; he simplifies the issue of AI explainability so it can be solved using traditional methods. He covers the high-level definitions of bias in machine learning to remove ambiguity and demystifies it through a hands-on example, in which the objective is to automate the loan-approval process for a company using machine learning, which allows you to go through this challenge step by step and use key tools and techniques from the latest research together with domain expert knowledge at the right points to enable you to explain decisions and mitigate undesired bias in machine learning models.\n            </p><p>\n                Alejandro breaks undesired bias down into two constituent parts: a priori societal bias and a posteriori statistical bias, with tangible examples of how undesired bias is introduced in each step, and you’ll learn some very interesting research findings in this topic. Spoiler alert: Alejandro takes a pragmatic approach, showing how any nontrivial system will always have an inherent bias, so the objective is not to remove bias, but to make sure you can get as close as possible to your objectives and make sure your objectives are as close as possible to the ideal solution.\n            </p><p><b>Prerequisite knowledge</b></p><ul><li>Experience with a machine learning project</li></ul><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><ul><li>\n                    Gain an overview of the concept of bias in machine learning\n                </li><li>\n                    Learn the three key steps to assess bias throughout the lifecycle of a machine learning model\n                </li><li>\n                    Understand how key machine learning concepts, such as feature importance, class imbalance, model analysis, partial dependence, etc., are used in a practical example, as well as how these data science fundamentals can be used to interact with key domain experts\n                </li></ul><p>\n                This session is from the 2019 O'Reilly Artificial Intelligence Conference in San Jose, CA.\n            </p></div></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>\n                With the fundamental breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and the significant increase of digital healthcare data, there’s been enormous interest in AI for healthcare applications. One rapidly developing area is the use of deep neural networks for medical imaging, with applications ranging from diagnosing chest X-rays to the early detection of Alzheimer’s to identifying cancer in pathology slides.\n            </p><p>\n                Despite this variety of applications, there remain some crucial unanswered questions. On the methods side, there’s been a premature convergence on a specific model-development strategy: deep neural networks are first trained on natural image data, and then fine-tuned (transferred) to work on the medical data. Maithra Raghu (Cornell University | Google Brain) explores this process and shows that contrary to conventional wisdom, this standard method of model development isn’t guaranteed to provide the benefits it’s believed to, and she suggests simple and effective alternate methodologies.\n            </p><p>\n                On the applications side, there’s been little exploration of the interaction of these medical AI algorithms with human experts, with existing literature typically evaluating the algorithm in isolation and the human experts in isolation—vastly different from a realistic deployment scenario. Maithra examines the essential question—the role of human experts—which provides new, crucial prediction problems to study and significant benefits through the effective combination of artificial and human intelligence.\n            </p><p><b>Prerequisite knowledge</b></p><ul><li>\n                    General knowledge of developing machine learning models (specifically deep neural networks) (useful but not required)\n                </li></ul><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><ul><li>\n                    Learn the standard methods for developing algorithms (deep neural networks) for medical imaging applications and ways to improve these, as well as places where conventional beliefs might be misleading\n                </li><li>\n                    See typical possible deployment scenarios for these technologies and the kinds of challenges and benefits that arise through interaction with human experts\n                </li></ul><p>\n                This session is from the 2019 O'Reilly Artificial Intelligence Conference in San Jose, CA.\n            </p></div></span></span>",

AI-centric organizations exhibit a new operating architecture, redefining how they create, capture, share, and deliver value.</p>\n\n<p>Marco Iansiti and Karim R. Lakhani show how reinventing the firm around data, analytics, and AI removes traditional constraints on scale, scope, and learning that have constrained business growth for hundreds of years.

    "description": "<span><p>Once thought of as science fiction, major corporations are already beginning to use cognitive systems to assist in providing wealth advice and also in medication treatment. The use of Cognitive Analytics/Artificial Intelligence (AI) Systems is set to accelerate, with the expectation that it'll be considered \"mainstream\" in the next five to ten years. It'll change the way we as individuals interact with data and systems-and the way we run our businesses.</p>\n\n<p>Advanced Analytics and AI prepares business users for the era of cognitive analytics/artificial intelligence. Building on established texts and commentary, it specifically prepares you in terms of expectation, impact on personal roles, and responsibilities. It focuses on the specific impact on key industries (retail, financial services, utilities and media) and also on key professions (such as accounting, operational management, supply chain and risk management).</p>\n\n<p>- Shows you how users interact with the system in natural language</p>\n\n<p>- Explains how cognitive analysis/AI can source \"big data\"</p>\n\n<p>- Provides a roadmap for implementation</p>\n\n<p>- Gets you up to speed now before you get left behind</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>Much of our daily lives intertwine with artificial intelligence. From watching movies recommended by our entertainment streaming service, to interacting with customer service chatbots, to autotagging photos of friends in our social media apps, AI plays an invisible part in enriching our lives. While AI may be seen as a panacea for enterprise advancement and consumer convenience, it is still an emerging technology, and its explosive growth needs to be approached with proper care and preparation. How do we tackle the challenges it presents, and how do we make sure that it does precisely what it is supposed to do?</p><p>In <i><b>Keeping Your AI Under Control</b></i>, author Anand Tamboli explores the inherent risk factors of the widespread implementation of artificial intelligence. The author delves into several real-life case studies of AI gone wrong, including Microsoft’s 2016 chatbot disaster, Uber’s autonomous vehicle fatally wounding a pedestrian, and an entire smart home in Germany dangerously malfunctioning because of one bad lightbulb. He expertly addresses the need to challenge our current assumptions about the infallibility of technology.</p><p> </p><p>The importance of data governance, rigorous testing before roll-out, a chain of human accountability, ethics, and much more are all detailed in <i><b>Keeping Your AI Under Control</b></i>. Artificial intelligence will not solve all of our problems for good, but it can (and will) present us with new solutions. These solutions can only be achieved with proper planning, continued maintenance, and above all, a foundation of attuned human supervision.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><p></p><ul><li>Understand various types of risks involved in developing and using AI solutions</li><li>Identify, evaluate, and quantify risks pragmatically </li><li>Utilize AI insurance to support residual risk management</li></ul><p></p><p></p></div><b><div><b><br/></b></div>Who This Book Is For</b><div><br/></div><div>Progressive businesses that are on a journey to use AI (buyers/customers), technical and financial leaders in AI solution companies (solution vendors), AI system integrators (intermediaries), project and technology leads of AI deployment projects, technology purchase decision makers, CXOs and legal officers (solution users).</div></span>",

This paper expands the reference architecture to cover all of the major vertical areas of healthcare and life sciences industries, such as genomics, imaging, and clinical and translational research.</p><p>The architecture was renamed IBM Reference Architecture for High Performance Data and AI in Healthcare and Life Sciences to reflect the fact that it incorporates key building blocks for high-performance computing (HPC) and software-defined storage, and that it supports an expanding infrastructure of leading industry partners, platforms, and frameworks.</p><p>The reference architecture defines a highly flexible, scalable, and cost-effective platform for accessing, managing, storing, sharing, integrating, and analyzing big data, which can be deployed on-premises, in the cloud, or as a hybrid of the two. IT organizations can use the reference architecture as a high-level guide for overcoming data management challenges and processing bottlenecks that are frequently encountered in personalized healthcare initiatives, and in compute-intensive and data-intensive biomedical workloads.</p><p>This reference architecture also provides a framework and context for modern healthcare and life sciences institutions to adopt cutting-edge technologies, such as cognitive life sciences solutions, machine learning and deep learning, Spark for analytics, and cloud computing. To illustrate these points, this paper includes case studies describing how clients and IBM Business Partners alike used the reference architecture in the deployments of demanding infrastructures for precision medicine.</p><p>This publication targets technical professionals (consultants, technical support staff, IT Architects, and IT Specialists) who are responsible for providing life sciences solutions and support.</p></span>",

    "title": "AI Narratives",
    "description": "<span><p>This book is the first to examine the history of imaginative thinking about intelligent machines. As real Artificial Intelligence (AI) begins to touch on all aspects of our lives, this long narrative history shapes how the technology is developed, deployed, and regulated. It is therefore a crucial social and ethical issue. </p>\n\n<p>Part I of this book provides a historical overview from ancient Greece to the start of modernity. These chapters explore the revealing pre-history of key concerns of contemporary AI discourse, from the nature of mind and creativity to issues of power and rights, from the tension between fascination and ambivalence to investigations into artificial voices and technophobia. Part II focuses on the twentieth and twenty-first-centuries in which a greater density of narratives emerge alongside rapid developments in AI technology. These chapters reveal not only how AI narratives have consistently been entangled with the emergence of real robotics and AI, but also how they offer a rich source of insight into how we might live with these revolutionary machines.  </p>\n\n<p>The contributions, from leading humanities and social science scholars, show that narratives about AI offer a crucial epistemic site for exploring contemporary debates about these powerful new technologies.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Electric vehicles/hybrid electric vehicles (EV/HEV) commercialization is still a challenge in industries in terms of performance and cost.  The performance along with cost reduction are two tradeoffs which need to be researched to arrive at an optimal solution. This book focuses on the convergence of various technologies involved in EV/HEV.</p><p>The book brings together the research that is being carried out in the field of EV/HEV whose leading role is by optimization techniques with artificial intelligence (AI). Other featured research includes green drive schemes which involve the possible renewable energy sources integration to develop eco-friendly green vehicles, as well as Internet of Things (IoT)-based techniques for EV/HEVs. Electric vehicle research involves multi-disciplinary expertise from electrical, electronics, mechanical engineering and computer science. Consequently, this book serves as a point of convergence wherein all these domains are addressed and merged and will serve as a potential resource for industrialists and researchers working in the domain of electric vehicles.     </p></span>",

The Foundations of AI, Big Data and Data Science Landscape for Professionals in Healthcare, Business, and Government (978-0-367-35968-3, 325690)</strong></p><p>Professionals are challenged each day by a changing landscape of technology and terminology. In recent history, especially in the last 25 years, there has been an explosion of terms and methods that automate and improve decision-making and operations. One term, \"analytics,\" is an overarching description of a compilation of methodologies. But AI (artificial intelligence), statistics, decision science, and optimization, which have been around for decades, have resurged. Also, things like business intelligence, online analytical processing (OLAP) and many, many more have been born or reborn. How is someone to make sense of all this methodology and terminology?</p><p>This book, the first in a series of three, provides a look at the foundations of artificial intelligence and analytics and why readers need an unbiased understanding of the subject. The authors include the basics such as algorithms, mental concepts, models, and paradigms in addition to the benefits of machine learning. The book also includes a chapter on data and the various forms of data. The authors wrap up this book with a look at the next frontiers such as applications and designing your environment for success, which segue into the topics of the next two books in the series.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>This book explains why AI is unique, what legal and ethical problems it could cause, and how we can address them. It argues that AI is unlike any other previous technology, owing to its ability to take decisions independently and unpredictably. This gives rise to three issues: responsibility-who is liable if AI causes harm; rights-the disputed moral and pragmatic grounds for granting AI legal personality; and the ethics surrounding the decision-making of AI. The book suggests that in order to address these questions we need to develop new institutions and regulations on a cross-industry and international level. Incorporating clear explanations of complex topics, Robot Rules will appeal to a multi-disciplinary audience, from those with an interest in law, politics and philosophy, to computer programming, engineering, and neuroscience. </p></span>",

In this session, we talk about how the actions of AI are the result of the human inputs going into its programming. We talk about how an AI’s bias is not its own, but the human bias with which it has been programmed. We emphasize the choice of the right metric and the type of data used for testing and training to avoid such bias. We discuss the need to understand the dependence between the data used and the models employed and optimize only areas that matter. We discuss how to focus on feature engineering and be thoughtful about the ethics of ML applications. Other issues such as the need for regulations and other considerations within it that require deliberation are also touched upon.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><b>AI is radically transforming business. Are you ready?</b></p><p>Look around you. Artificial intelligence is no longer just a futuristic notion. It's here right now--in software that senses what we need, supply chains that \"think\" in real time, and robots that respond to changes in their environment. Twenty-first-century pioneer companies are already using AI to innovate and grow <i>fast</i>. The bottom line is this: Businesses that understand how to harness AI can surge ahead. Those that neglect it will fall behind. Which side are you on?</p><p>In <i>Human + Machine</i>, Accenture leaders Paul R. Daugherty and H. James (Jim) Wilson show that the essence of the AI paradigm shift is the transformation of all <i>business processes</i> within an organization--whether related to breakthrough innovation, everyday customer service, or personal productivity habits. As humans and smart machines collaborate ever more closely, work processes become more fluid and adaptive, enabling companies to change them on the fly--or to completely reimagine them. AI is changing all the rules of how companies operate.</p><p>Based on the authors' experience and research with 1,500 organizations, the book reveals how companies are using the new rules of AI to leap ahead on innovation and profitability, as well as what you can do to achieve similar results. It describes six entirely new types of hybrid human + machine roles that every company must develop, and it includes a \"leader’s guide\" with the five crucial principles required to become an AI-fueled business.</p><p><i>Human + Machine</i> provides the missing and much-needed management playbook for success in our new age of AI.</p><p><b>BOOK PROCEEDS FOR THE AI GENERATION</b><br/>The authors' goal in publishing <i>Human + Machine</i> is to help executives, workers, students and others navigate the changes that AI is making to business and the economy. They believe AI will bring innovations that truly improve the way the world works and lives. However, AI will cause disruption, and many people will need education, training and support to prepare for the newly created jobs. To support this need, the authors are donating the royalties received from the sale of this book to fund education and retraining programs focused on developing fusion skills for the age of artificial intelligence.</p></span>",

The leading discussions on this topic bring in diverse ideas such as that of data, the fantasy of Big Data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, algorithmic processing, the flow of information and the outstanding successes of disinformation.<br/><br/>The purpose of this book is to show that the current context of documentation is just another step in human construction that has been ongoing for not centuries but millennia and which, since the end of the 19th century, has been accelerating. Coined by Paul Otlet in 1934 in his Traite de Documentation, \"hyperdocumentation\" refers to the concept of documentation that is constantly being expanded and extended in its functionalities and prerogatives.<br/><br/>While, according to Otlet, everything could potentially be documented in this way, increasingly we find that it is our lives that are being hyperdocumented. Hyperdocumentation manifests as an increase not only in the quantity of information that is processed but also in its scope, as information is progressively integrated across areas that were previously poorly documented or even undocumented.\n   \n  </span>",

    "description": "<span><p><b>The ultimate playbook for using artificial intelligence to communicate effectively, build teams, and win customers</b></p><p>Not long ago, we imagined a hyper-connected world full of trust and openness—a world where effortless communication would bring about a new understanding between people everywhere. Judging from our current environment, this vision of the future may have been overly optimistic. With infinite channels and countless voices flooding them with messages, most people have become highly skeptical and guarded by necessity. As a result, communication is <i>much harder</i> than ever before.</p><p>Despite the unprecedented connectivity enabled by modern technology, we are far less likely to trust and to invest the time needed to build strong relationships. How can we use technology to reverse this trend? A groundbreaking new branch of artificial intelligence—Personality AI—may be the answer. Combining traditional machine learning, data analytics, and behavioral psychology, Personality AI helps professional communicators tear down walls, establish trust with their audiences, and utilize data to build meaningful relationships, strengthen empathy, and win more customers.</p><p><i>Predicting Personality </i>is a practical, real-world playbook for any individual or business whose success hinges on the ability to communicate effectively and build teams. Authors Drew D’Agostino and Greg Skloot—CEO and President, respectively, of Crystal, the app that tells you anyone's personality—show you how businesses can leverage Personality AI and machine learning to grow faster and communicate more effectively than was previously possible. This reader-friendly guide teaches you what Personality AI is, how it works, and demonstrates its practical applications in both life and business. This book:</p><p>●      Explains how to understand personality types in various contexts, including sales, recruiting, coaching</p><p>●      Provides guidelines for using personality data to learn and execute</p><p>●      Explores ethics and compliance considerations surrounding the use of Personality AI</p><p>●      Offers valuable insights from a leader in the business applications of Personality AI</p><p><i>Predicting Personality: Using AI to Understand People and Win More Business </i>is a must-have guide for C-suite executives, sales and marketing professionals, coaches, recruiters, and business owners.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Presented by Douglas Hamilton – Chief Data Scientist, NASDAQ’s Machine Intelligence Lab</p><p>Over the last decade, hundreds of billions of dollars of capital have retreated from active to passive management, driven in part by investors seeking lower management fees. With this we have seen rapid growth in the index and exchange traded fund space, leading to the development of several distinct classes. At least one of these classes, Smart Beta, is ripe for AI augmentation. We outline the unique challenges of index management and discuss the application of Information Theory, Machine Learning, and Optimization in solving those challenges.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Presented by Sangeeta Krishnan – Former Director, Enterprise Data Management &amp; Strategy at Asembia</p><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the current buzz word across all industries. Marvin Minsky’s definition of AI describes it as the science of making machines do things that would normally require human intelligence. However, the opinions are split across two camps. On one side we hear about new AI gadgets getting introduced in the market that would empower and improve our lives. At the same time, there are stories of AI companies going bankrupt like the recent closure of AI powered clock – Bonjour.</p><p>Any digital technology has its own risks such as Cyber Security, Data Privacy Protection, apart from protecting the interests and careers of the human workforce. When you attempt to transform data into answers, many questions erupt. AI is a combination of techniques that includes Data Analytics and Predictive Analytics. Many organizations start their Analytics and AI journey without implementing the discovery phase of defining clear achievable business values. This results in most of the R&amp;D budget to evaporate in experimental pitfalls with no real gain, resulting in AI being non-productive. It is imperative for any organization to discuss and focus on certain fundamental areas and challenges before embarking on the AI journey.</p><p>This presentation would give a detailed overview of the areas that need to be addressed for the AI journey to be successful beyond PoC (Proof of Concept). It would demystify AI from an implementation stand point and would cover multiple aspects to demonstrate the current capabilities of AI technologies. It would also put out a road map for the industries to have a smooth journey to the AI world. The presentation would discuss the entire spread of activities such as budgeting, risk mitigation, training and many more.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>As machines are trained to \"think,\" many tasks that previously required human intelligence are becoming automated through artificial intelligence. However, it is more difficult to automate emotional intelligence, and this is where the human worker's competitive advantage over machines currently lies. This book explores the impact of AI on everyday life, looking into workers' adaptation to these changes, the ways in which managers can change the nature of jobs in light of AI developments, and the potential for humans and AI to continue working together.</p>\n\n<p>The book argues that AI is rapidly assuming a larger share of thinking tasks, leaving human intelligence to focus on feeling. The result is the \"Feeling Economy,\" in which both employees and consumers emphasize feeling to an unprecedented extent, with thinking tasks largely delegated to AI. The book shows both theoretical and empirical evidence that this shift is well underway. Further, it explores the effect of the Feeling Economy on our everyday lives in the areas such as shopping, politics, and education. Specifically, it argues that in this new economy, through empathy and people skills, women may gain an unprecedented degree of power and influence. <br></p></span>",

Our lives may well be changed, but not necessarily for the better. Computers are very good at discovering patterns, but are useless in judging whether the unearthed patterns are sensible because computers do not think the way humans think.</p>\n\n<p>We fear that super-intelligent machines will decide to protect themselves by enslaving or eliminating humans.

Using machine learning (ML) and deep\nlearning (DL) in big data environments can identify historical\npatterns and build artificial intelligence (AI) models that can\nhelp businesses to improve customer experience, add services and\nofferings, identify new revenue streams or lines of business\n(LOBs), and optimize business or manufacturing operations. The\npower of AI for predictive analytics is being harnessed across all\nindustries, so it is important that businesses familiarize\nthemselves with all of the tools and techniques that are available\nfor integration with their data lake environments.</p><p>In this IBM® Redbooks® publication, we cover the best practices\nfor deploying and integrating some of the best AI solutions on the\nmarket, including:<br/></p><br/><li><p>IBM Watson Machine Learning Accelerator (see note for product\nnaming)<br/></p></li><li><p>IBM Watson Studio Local<br/></p></li><li><p>IBM Power Systems™<br/></p></li><li><p>IBM Spectrum™ Scale<br/></p></li><li><p>IBM Data Science Experience (IBM DSX)<br/></p></li><li><p>IBM Elastic Storage™ Server<br/></p></li><li><p>Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP)<br/></p></li><li><p>Hortonworks DataFlow (HDF)<br/></p></li><li><p>H2O Driverless AI<br/></p></li><p><br/>\nWe map out all the integrations that are possible with our\ndifferent AI solutions and how they can integrate with your\nexisting or new data lake. We also walk you through some of our\nclient use cases and show you how some of the industry leaders are\nusing Hortonworks, IBM PowerAI, and IBM Watson Studio Local to\ndrive decision making. We also advise you on your deployment\noptions, when to use a GPU, and why you should use the IBM Elastic\nStorage Server (IBM ESS) to improve storage management. Lastly, we\ndescribe how to integrate IBM Watson Machine Learning Accelerator\nand Hortonworks with or without IBM Watson Studio Local, how to\naccess real-time data, and security.</p><p>Note: IBM Watson Machine Learning Accelerator is the new product\nname for IBM PowerAI Enterprise.</p><p>Note: Hortonworks merged with Cloudera in January 2019. The new\ncompany is called Cloudera.

On the other hand, the same technologies raise the specter of a frightening future—eugenics, a jobless economy, a complete loss of privacy, and ever-worsening economic inequality. <br/><br/>Wadhwa says that we need to ask three questions about every emerging technology: Does it have the potential to benefit everyone equally? What are the risks and the rewards? And does it promote autonomy or dependence? This edition is updated throughout and includes a new chapter on quantum computing, which promises vastly increased processing times—and vastly increased security risks. In the end, our future is up to us; our hands may not be on the wheel, but we will decide the driverless car's destination.<br/>\n  </span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the modern world. It is ubiquitous-in our homes and offices, in the present and most certainly in the future. Today, we encounter AI as our distant ancestors once encountered fire. If we manage AI well, it will become a force for good, lighting the way to many transformative inventions. If we deploy it thoughtlessly, it will advance beyond our control. If we wield it for destruction, it will fan the flames of a new kind of war, one that holds democracy in the balance. As AI policy experts Ben Buchanan and Andrew Imbrie show in The New Fire, few choices are more urgent-or more fascinating-than how we harness this technology and for what purpose.<br> <br>The new fire has three sparks: data, algorithms, and computing power. These components fuel viral disinformation campaigns, new hacking tools, and military weapons that once seemed like science fiction. To autocrats, AI offers the prospect of centralized control at home and asymmetric advantages in combat. It is easy to assume that democracies, bound by ethical constraints and disjointed in their approach, will be unable to keep up. But such a dystopia is hardly preordained. Combining an incisive understanding of technology with shrewd geopolitical analysis, Buchanan and Imbrie show how AI can work for democracy. With the right approach, technology need not favor tyranny.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span>\n    The coauthors of the seminal book The Virtual Corporation describe how the rise of artificial intelligence and virtual environments are ushering in an epic cultural transformation—and how we can thrive in this new era.<br/><br/>We are at the dawn of the Autonomous Revolution, a turning point in human history as decisive as the Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions. More and more, AI-based machines are replacing human beings, and online environments are gathering our data and using it to manipulate us. This loss of human autonomy amounts to nothing less than a societal phase change, a fundamental paradigm shift. The same institutions will remain—schools, banks, churches, and corporations—but they will radically change form, obey new rules, and use new tools. <br/><br/>William H. Davidow and Michael S. Malone go deeply into the enormous implications of these developments. They show why increases in productivity no longer translate into increases in the GDP and how zero cost, one-to-many communications have been turned into tools for cybercrime and propaganda. Many of the book's recommendations—such as using taxes to control irresponsible internet behavior and enabling people to put their data into what are essentially virtual personal information “safety deposit boxes”—are bold and visionary, but we must figure out how we will deal with these emerging challenges now, before the Autonomous Revolution overcomes us.<br/><br/>\n  </span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Your organization has made the decision to adopt automation and artificial intelligence technologies. Now, you face difficult and stubborn questions about how to implement that decision: How, when, and where should we apply automation in our organization? Is it a stark choice between humans versus machines? How do we stay on top of these technological trends as work and automation continue to evolve?</p>\n\n<p>Work and human capital experts Ravin Jesuthasan and John Boudreau present leaders with a new set of tools to answer these daunting questions. Transcending the endless debate about humans being replaced by machines, Jesuthasan and Boudreau show how smart leaders instead are optimizing human-automation combinations that are not only more efficient but also generate higher returns on improved performance.</p>\n\n<p>Based on groundbreaking primary research, Reinventing Jobs provides an original, structured approach of four distinct steps-deconstruct, optimize, automate, and reconfigure-to help leaders reinvent how work gets bundled into jobs and create optimal human-machine combinations. Jesuthasan and Boudreau show leaders how to continuously reexamine what a job really is, and they provide the tools for identifying the pivotal performance value of tasks within jobs and how these tasks should be reconstructed into new, more optimal combinations.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><br/>      With the end of Moore's law and the emergence of new application needs such as those of the Internet of Things (IoT) or artificial intelligence (AI), neuro-inspired, or neuromorphic, information processing is attracting more and more attention from the scientific community. Its principle is to emulate in a simplified way the formidable machine to process information which is the brain, with neurons and artificial synapses organized in network. These networks can be software – and therefore implemented in the form of a computer program – but also hardware and produced by nanoelectronic circuits. The 'material' path allows very low energy consumption, and the possibility of faithfully reproducing the shape and dynamics of the action potentials of living neurons (biomimetic approach) or even being up to a thousand times faster (high frequency approach). This path is promising and welcomed by the major manufacturers of nanoelectronics, as circuits can now today integrate several million neurons and artificial synapses.<br/>   </p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>With the ongoing advancement of AI and other technologies, our world is becoming increasingly intelligent. From chatbots to innovations in brain-computer interfaces to the possibility of superintelligences leading to the Singularity later this century, our reality is being transformed before our eyes. This is commonly seen as the natural result of progress, but what if there's more to it than that? What if intelligence is an inevitability, an underlying property of the universe?<br> <br>In Future Minds, Richard Yonck challenges our assumptions about intelligence-what it is, how it came to exist, its place in the development of life on Earth and possibly throughout the cosmos. Taking a Big History perspective-over the 14 billion years from the Big Bang to the present and beyond-he draws on recent developments in physics and complexity theory to explore the questions: Why do pockets of increased complexity develop, giving rise to life, intelligence, and civilization? How will it grow and change throughout this century, transforming both technology and humanity? As we expand outward from our planet, will we discover other forms of intelligence, or will we conclude we are destined to go it alone? Any way we look at it, the nature of intelligence in the universe is becoming a central concern for humanity.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Nearly half of all working Americans could risk losing their jobs because of technology. It's not only blue-collar jobs at stake. Millions of educated knowledge workers are threatened by accelerating advances in artificial intelligence.</p>\n\n<p>The industrial revolution shifted workers from farms to factories. In the first era of automation, machines relieved humans of manually exhausting work. Today, Era Two of automation continues to wash across the entire services-based economy that has replaced jobs in agriculture and manufacturing. Era Three, and the rise of AI, is dawning. Smart computers are demonstrating they are capable of making better decisions than humans. Brilliant technologies can now decide, learn, predict, and even comprehend much faster and more accurately than the human brain, and their progress is accelerating.</p>\n\n<p>In Only Humans Need Apply, Thomas Hayes Davenport and Julia Kirby reframe the conversation about automation, arguing that the future of increased productivity and business success isn't either human or machine. It's both. The key is augmentation, utilizing technology to help humans work better, smarter, and faster. Instead of viewing these machines as competitive interlopers, we can see them as partners and collaborators in creative problem solving as we move into the next era. </p></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>With the big data boom, the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), and the development of artificial intelligence (AI) applications, we’ve entered a new era of smart data. Unfortunately, not many enterprises are ready for it. Some companies are deficient in data management, while others lack standard data engineering systems. Some simply lag behind in data science.</p><p>The bottom line is that many enterprises have no advanced technical platform for building IoT-driven AI applications. But there is a practical solution.</p><p>This report examines how the Smart Data Platform, or SmartDP, enables enterprises to enhance their capacities in data management, data engineering, and data science. Authors Yifei Lin and Xiao Wenfeng of TalkingData describe a complete SmartDP solution that involves data, platform products, data applications, and consulting services—components that together can supplement and strengthen your current data platforms.</p><p>Explore SmartDP from concept to practice and discover how implementing this solution will allow your organization to achieve new business value.</p></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Hidden beneath the surface of the internet, a new, stark reality is looming-one that cuts to the very heart of our endless debates about the impact of AI. Anthropologist Mary L. Gray and computer scientist Siddharth Suri team up to unveil how services delivered by companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Uber can only function smoothly thanks to the judgment and experience of a vast, invisible human labor force. These people doing \"ghost work\" make the internet seem smart. They perform high tech, on-demand piecework: flagging X rated content, proofreading, transcribing audio, confirming identities, captioning video, and much more. An estimated 8 percent of Americans have worked at least once in this \"ghost economy,\" and that number is growing.</p>\n\n<p>There are no labor laws to govern this kind of work, and these latter-day assembly lines draw in-and all too often overwork and underpay-a surprisingly diverse range of workers: harried young mothers, professionals forced into early retirement, recent grads who can't get a toehold on the traditional employment ladder, and minorities shut out of the jobs they want. Gray and Suri also show how workers, employers, and society at large can ensure that this new kind of work creates opportunity-rather than misery-for those who do it.<br></p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><b>Make. More. Future.</b></p><p>Artificial intelligence, big data, modern science, and the internet are all revealing a fundamental truth: The world is vastly more complex and unpredictable than we've allowed ourselves to see.</p><p>Now that technology is enabling us to take advantage of all the chaos it's revealing, our understanding of how things happen is changing--and with it our deepest strategies for predicting, preparing for, and managing our world. This affects everything, from how we approach our everyday lives to how we make moral decisions and how we run our businesses.</p><p>Take machine learning, which makes better predictions about weather, medical diagnoses, and product performance than we do--but often does so at the expense of our understanding of how it arrived at those predictions. While this can be dangerous, accepting it is also liberating, for it enables us to harness the complexity of an immense amount of data around us. We are also turning to strategies that avoid anticipating the future altogether, such as A/B testing, Minimum Viable Products, open platforms, and user-modifiable video games. We even take for granted that a simple hashtag can organize unplanned, leaderless movements such as #MeToo.</p><p>Through stories from history, business, and technology, philosopher and technologist David Weinberger finds the unifying truths lying below the surface of the tools we take for granted--and a future in which our best strategy often requires holding back from anticipating and instead creating as many possibilities as we can. The book’s imperative for business and beyond is simple: Make. More. Future.</p><p>The result is a world no longer focused on limitations but optimized for possibilities.</p></span>",

These machines, while challenging our personal beliefs and our socio-economic world order, also have the potential to transform our health and well-being, alleviate poverty and suffering, and reveal the mysteries of intelligence and consciousness. International human rights attorney Flynn Coleman deftly argues that it is critical we instill values, ethics, and morals into our robots, algorithms, and other forms of AI. Equally important, we need to develop and implement laws, policies, and oversight mechanisms to protect us from tech's insidious threats.</p>\n\n<p>To realize AI's transcendent potential, Coleman advocates for inviting a diverse group of voices to participate in designing our intelligent machines and using our moral imagination to ensure that human rights, empathy, and equity are core principles of emerging technologies. Ultimately, A Human Algorithm is a clarion call for building a more humane future and moving conscientiously into a new frontier of our own design.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>In Artificial Unintelligence, Meredith Broussard argues that our collective enthusiasm for applying computer technology to every aspect of life has resulted in a tremendous amount of poorly designed systems. We are so eager to do everything digitally-hiring, driving, paying bills, even choosing romantic partners-that we have stopped demanding that our technology actually work. Broussard, a software developer and journalist, reminds us that there are fundamental limits to what we can (and should) do with technology.</p>\n\n<p>Making a case against technochauvinism-the belief that technology is always the solution-Broussard argues that it's just not true that social problems would inevitably retreat before a digitally enabled Utopia. To prove her point, she undertakes a series of adventures in computer programming. She goes for an alarming ride in a driverless car; uses artificial intelligence to investigate why students can't pass standardized tests; deploys machine learning to predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster; and attempts to repair the U.S. campaign finance system by building AI software.

    "description": "<span><p>As the world around us increases in technological complexity, our understanding of it diminishes. Underlying this trend is a single idea: the belief that our existence is understandable through computation, and more data is enough to help us build a better world.</p>\n\n<p>In reality, we are lost in a sea of information, increasingly divided by fundamentalism, simplistic narratives, conspiracy theories, and post-factual politics. Meanwhile, those in power use our lack of understanding to further their own interests. Despite the apparent accessibility of information, we're living in a new Dark Age.</p>\n\n<p>From rogue financial systems to shopping algorithms, from artificial intelligence to state secrecy, we no longer understand how our world is governed or presented to us. The media is filled with unverifiable speculation, much of it generated by anonymous software, while companies dominate their employees through surveillance and the threat of automation.</p>\n\n<p>In his brilliant new work, leading artist and writer James Bridle surveys the history of art, technology, and information systems, and reveals the dark clouds that gather over our dreams of the digital sublime.</p></span>",

Now, you face difficult and stubborn questions about how to implement that decision: How, when, and where should we apply automation in our organization? Is it a stark choice between humans versus machines? How do we stay on top of these technological trends as work and automation continue to evolve?</p><p>Work and human capital experts Ravin Jesuthasan and John Boudreau present leaders with a new set of tools to answer these daunting questions. Transcending the endless debate about humans being replaced by machines, Jesuthasan and Boudreau show how smart leaders instead are optimizing human-automation combinations that are not only more efficient but also generate higher returns on improved performance.</p><p>Based on groundbreaking primary research, <i>Reinventing Jobs</i> provides an original, structured approach of four distinct steps--deconstruct, optimize, automate, and reconfigure--to help leaders reinvent how work gets bundled into jobs and create optimal human-machine combinations. Jesuthasan and Boudreau show leaders how to continuously reexamine what a job really is, and they provide the tools for identifying the pivotal performance value of tasks within jobs and how these tasks should be reconstructed into new, more optimal combinations.</p><p>With numerous examples and practical advice for applying the four-step process, <i>Reinventing Jobs</i> gives leaders a more precise, planful, and actionable way to decide how, when, and where to apply and optimize work automation.</p></span>",

Since the advent of computers, research has focused on the design of digital machine translation tools-computer programs capable of automatically translating a text from a source language to a target language. This has become one of the most fundamental tasks of artificial intelligence. This volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series offers a concise, nontechnical overview of the development of machine translation, including the different approaches, evaluation issues, and market potential. The main approaches are presented from a largely historical perspective and in an intuitive manner, allowing the reader to understand the main principles without knowing the mathematical details.</p></span>",

Rather, it calibrates them with a creative mindset and the mental elasticity to invent, discover, or create something valuable to society-a scientific proof, a hip-hop recording, a web comic, a cure for cancer. Aoun lays out the framework for a new discipline, humanics, which builds on our innate strengths and prepares students to compete in a labor market in which smart machines work alongside human professionals. The new literacies of Aoun's humanics are data literacy, technological literacy, and human literacy. Students will need data literacy to manage the flow of big data, and technological literacy to know how their machines work, but human literacy-the humanities, communication, and design-to function as a human being. Life-long learning opportunities will support their ability to adapt to change.<br></p></span>",

    "title": "Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems",
    "description": "<span><p><i>Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems</i> is a complete and accessible account of the theoretical foundations and computational methods that underlie plausible reasoning under uncertainty.  The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic.<br/> </p><p>The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty--and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational.  Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation.  Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition--in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information.</p><br/><p><i>Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems</i> will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences.  Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use.  The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability.</p></span>",

Heart of the Machine explores the next giant step in the relationship between humans and technology: the ability of computers to recognize, respond to, and even replicate emotions. Computers have long been integral to our lives, and their advances continue at an exponential rate. Many believe that artificial intelligence equal or superior to human intelligence will happen in the not-too-distance future. Futurist Richard Yonck argues that emotion, the first, most basic, and most natural form of communication, is at the heart of how we will soon work with and use computers.</p>\n\n<p>Instilling emotions into computers is the next leap in our centuries-old obsession with creating machines that replicate humans. But for every benefit this progress may bring to our lives, there is a possible pitfall. Emotion recognition could lead to advanced surveillance, and the same technology that can manipulate our feelings could become a method of mass control. Heart of the Machine is an exploration of the new and inevitable ways in which mankind and technology will interact.</p></span>",

In some ways, the future people dreamed of at the World's Fair in the 1960s is already here. We're teaching our machines how to think like humans, and they're learning at an incredible rate.</p>\n\n<p>In Thinking Machines, technology journalist Luke Dormehl takes you through the history of AI and how it makes up the foundations of the machines that think for us today. Furthermore, Dormehl speculates on the incredible-and possibly terrifying-future that's much closer than many would imagine.

    "description": "<span><p>Since the attacks of 9/11, the United States Intelligence Community (IC) has undergone an extensive overhaul. Perhaps the greatest of these changes has been the formation of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. As a cabinet-level official, the Director oversees the various agencies of the IC and reports directly to the President. The IC today faces challenges as it never has before; everything from terrorism to pandemics to economic stability has now become an intelligence issue. As a result, the IC is shifting its focus to a world in which tech-savvy domestic and international terrorists, transnational criminal organizations, failing states, and economic instability are now a way of life.</p><p/><strong><p>Introduction to Intelligence Studies</p></strong> provides a comprehensive overview of intelligence and security issues, defining critical terms, and reviewing the history of intelligence as practiced in the United States. Designed in a practical sequence, the book begins with the basics of intelligence, progresses through its history, describes best practices, and explores the way the IC looks and operates today. Each chapter begins with objectives and key terms and closes with questions to test reader assimilation.\n<p/>\n<p>The authors examine the \"pillars\" of the American intelligence system—collection, analysis, counterintelligence, and covert operations—and demonstrate how these work together to provide \"decision advantage.\" The book provides equal treatment to the functions of the intelligence world—balancing coverage on intelligence collection, counterintelligence, information management, critical thinking, and decision-making. It also covers such vital issues as laws and ethics, writing and briefing for the IC, and the emerging threats and challenges that intelligence professionals will face in the future.</p>\n<p/>\n\n  </span>",

As society stands on the cusp of unprecedented change, Jerry Kaplan unpacks the latest advances in robotics, machine learning, and perception powering systems that rival or exceed human capabilities. Driverless cars, robotic helpers, and intelligent agents that promote our interests have the potential to usher in a new age of affluence and leisure-but as Kaplan warns, the transition may be protracted and brutal unless we address the two great scourges of the modern developed world: volatile labor markets and income inequality. He proposes innovative, free-market adjustments to our economic system and social policies to avoid an extended period of social turmoil. His timely and accessible analysis of the promise and perils of artificial intelligence is a must-listen for business leaders and policy makers on both sides of the aisle.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>The idea that human history is approaching a \"singularity\" -- that ordinary humans will someday be overtaken by artificially intelligent machines or cognitively enhanced biological intelligence, or both -- has moved from the realm of science fiction to serious debate. Some singularity theorists predict that if the field of artificial intelligence (AI) continues to develop at its current dizzying rate, the singularity could come about in the middle of the present century. Murray Shanahan offers an introduction to the idea of the singularity and considers the ramifications of such a potentially seismic event.</p>\n\n<p>Shanahan's aim is not to make predictions but rather to investigate a range of scenarios. Whether we believe that singularity is near or far, likely or impossible, apocalypse or utopia, the very idea raises crucial philosophical and pragmatic questions, forcing us to think seriously about what we want as a species.</p>\n\n<p>Shanahan describes technological advances in AI, both biologically inspired and engineered from scratch. Once human-level AI -- theoretically possible, but difficult to accomplish -- has been achieved, he explains, the transition to superintelligent AI could be very rapid. Shanahan considers what the existence of superintelligent machines could mean for such matters as personhood, responsibility, rights, and identity. Some superhuman AI agents might be created to benefit humankind; some might go rogue. (Is Siri the template, or HAL?) The singularity presents both an existential threat to humanity and an existential opportunity for humanity to transcend its limitations. Shanahan makes it clear that we need to imagine both possibilities if we want to bring about the better outcome.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Planning, or reasoning about actions, is a fundamental element of intelligent behavior--and one that artificial intelligence has found very difficult to implement.  The most well-understood approach to building planning systems has been under refinement since the late 1960s and has now reached a level of maturity where there are good prospects for building working planners.</p><br/><p><i>Practical Planning</i> is an in-depth examination of this classical planning paradigm through an intensive case study of SIPE, a significantly implemented planning system.  The author, the developer of SIPE, defines the planning problem in general, explains why reasoning about actions is so complex, and describes all parts of the SIPE system and the algorithms needed to achieve efficiency.  Details are discussed in the context of problems and important issues in building a practical planner; discussions of how other systems address these issues are also included.</p><br/><p>Assuming only a basic background in AI, <i>Practical Planning</i> will be of great interest to professionals interested in incorporating planning capabilities into AI systems.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><br/>      This book studies formal semantics in modern type theories (MTTsemantics). Compared with simple type theory, MTTs have much richer type structures and provide powerful means for adequate semantic constructions. This offers a serious alternative to the traditional settheoretical foundation for linguistic semantics and opens up a new avenue for developing formal semantics that is both model-theoretic and proof-theoretic, which was not available before the development of MTTsemantics. This book provides a reader-friendly and precise description of MTTs and offers a comprehensive introduction to MTT-semantics. It develops several case studies, such as adjectival modification and copredication, to exemplify the attractiveness of using MTTs for the study of linguistic meaning. It also examines existing proof assistant technology based on MTT-semantics for the verification of semantic constructions and reasoning in natural language. Several advanced topics are also briefly studied, including dependent event types, an application of dependent typing to event semantics.<br/>   </p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><b>Discover new theoretical connections between stochastic phenomena and the structure of natural language with this powerful volume!</b></p><p><i>Information Theory Meets Power Laws: Stochastic Processes and Language Models</i> presents readers with a novel subtype of a probabilistic approach to language, which is based on statistical laws of texts and their analysis by means of information theory. The distinguished author insightfully and rigorously examines the linguistic and mathematical subject matter while eschewing needlessly abstract and superfluous constructions.</p><p>The book begins with a less formal treatment of its subjects in the first chapter, introducing its concepts to readers without mathematical training and allowing those unfamiliar with linguistics to learn the book’s motivations. Despite its inherent complexity, <i>Information Theory Meets Power Laws: Stochastic Processes and Language Models </i>is a surprisingly approachable treatment of idealized mathematical models of human language.</p><p>The author succeeds in developing some of the theory underlying fundamental stochastic and semantic phenomena, like strong nonergodicity, in a way that has not previously been seriously attempted. In doing so, he covers topics including:</p><ul><li>Zipf’s and Herdan’s laws for natural language</li><li>Power laws for information, repetitions, and correlations</li><li>Markov, finite-state,and Santa Fe processes</li><li>Bayesian and frequentist  interpretations of probability</li><li>Ergodic decomposition, Kolmogorov complexity, and universal coding</li><li>Theorems about facts and words</li><li>Information measures for fields</li><li>Rényi entropies, recurrence times, and subword complexity</li><li>Asymptotically mean stationary processes</li></ul><p>Written primarily for mathematics graduate students and professionals interested in information theory or discrete stochastic processes, <i>Information Theory Meets Power Laws: Stochastic Processes and Language Models </i>also belongs on the bookshelves of doctoral students and researchers in artificial intelligence, computational and quantitative linguistics as well as physics of complex systems.</p></span>",

It focuses on sequent calculi for various non-classical logics, from intuitionistic logic to relevance logic, linear logic, and modal logic.</p><p/><p>In the first chapters, the author emphasizes classical logic and a variety of different sequent calculi for classical and intuitionistic logics.

Computer scientists will discover intriguing connections between sequent calculi and resolution as well as between sequent calculi and typed systems. Those interested in the constructive approach will find formalizations of intuitionistic logic and two calculi for linear logic. Mathematicians and philosophers will welcome the treatment of a range of variations on calculi for classical logic.

The text then takes a look at inductive identification of pattern languages with restricted substitutions, learning ring-sum-expansions, sample complexity of PAC-learning using random and chosen examples, and some problems of learning with an Oracle.<br/><br/>The book examines a mechanical method of successful scientific inquiry, boosting a weak learning algorithm by majority, and learning by distances. Discussions focus on the relation to PAC learnability, majority-vote game, boosting a weak learner by majority vote, and a paradigm of scientific inquiry.<br/><br/>The selection is a dependable source of data for researchers interested in the computational learning theory.\n</span>",

Scientific applications are usually computation and data intensive, where complex computation tasks take a long time for execution and the generated datasets are often terabytes or petabytes in size. Storing valuable generated application datasets can save their regeneration cost when they are reused, not to mention the waiting time caused by regeneration. However, the large size of the scientific datasets is a big challenge for their storage.

    "description": "<span>\nAn ever-widening gap exists between how students and schools use communication technology. Using Network and Mobile Technology to Bridge Formal and Informal Learning introduces new methods (inspired by ‘pedagogy 2.0’) of harnessing the potential of communication technologies for teaching and learning. This book considers how attitudes towards network and mobile technology (NMT) gained outside the school can be shunted into new educational paradigms combining formal and informal learning processes. It begins with an overview of these paradigms, and their sustainability. It then considers the pedagogical dimension of formal/informal integration through NMT, moving on to teachers’ professional development. Next, the organizational development of schools in the context of formal and informal learning is detailed. Finally, the book covers the role of technologies supporting formal/informal integration into subject-oriented education.<ul><li>Includes a framework for the sustainability of new educational paradigms based on the combination of formal and informal learning processes supported by network and mobile technology (NMT)</li><li>Provides a series of recommendations on how to use attitudes towards NMT gained outside the school to integrate formal and informal learning</li><li>Gives a teacher training approach on how to use network and mobile technology-based informal learning to enhance formal learning pathways</li></ul>\n</span>",

It will enable a beginner to delve effectively into their usage, but will also challenge the experienced rune-worker to better and deepen his or her understanding of these mysteries.  Runes: Theory and Practice begins with an explication of the story of Odin, the Norse god who won the runes by sacrificing himself on the World Tree. It continues by examining each of the individual runes in turn, both the Elder Futhark and the lesser-known Anglo-Saxon Futhorc. Each rune is studied not only from a historical viewpoint, but also from the perspective of a modern practitioner. You will be introduced to the practice of galdr, the proper way to sacrifice to the runes, their magical usage, and the art of reading for divination.  Most importantly, Runes: Theory and Practice specifically addresses the runes as living spirits and provides guidance on developing a working relationship with these otherworldly allies.</p></span>",

In the book, students discover that bacteria communicate, that DNA can be used for performing computations, how evolution solves optimization problems, that the way ants organize their nests can be applied to solve clustering problems, and what the human immune system can teach us about protecting computer networks. The authors discuss more biological examples such as these, along with the computational techniques developed from these scenarios.</p><p/><p>The text focuses on cellular automata, evolutionary computation, neural networks, and molecular computation.

Then it moves into the case studies. The case studies start with EHR data and how you can account for sub-populations using a multi-task setup when you are working on any downstream task. You also will try to predict ICD-9 codes using the same data. You will study transformer models. And you will be exposed to the challenges of applying modern ML techniques to highly sensitive data in healthcare using federated learning. You will look at semi-supervised approaches that are used in a low training data setting, a case very often observed in specialized domains such as healthcare. You will be introduced to applications of advanced topics such as the graph convolutional network and how you can develop and optimize image analysis pipelines when using 2D and 3D medical images. The concluding section shows you how to build and design a closed-domain Q&amp;A system with paraphrasing, re-ranking, and strong QnA setup. And, lastly, after discussing how web and server technologies have come to make scaling and deploying easy, an ML app is deployed for the world to see with Docker using Flask.</div><div><br/></div><div>By the end of this book, you will have a clear understanding of how the healthcare system works and how to apply ML and deep learning  tools and techniques to the healthcare industry.<br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><b>What You Will Learn</b></div><div><ul><li>Get complete, clear, and comprehensive coverage of algorithms and techniques related to case studies </li><li>Look at different problem areas within the healthcare industry and solve them in a code-first approach</li><li>Explore and understand advanced topics such as multi-task learning, transformers, and graph convolutional networks</li><li>Understand the industry and learn ML</li></ul></div><div><br/></div><div> </div><div><div><br/></div><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b></div><div><br/></div><div>Data scientists and software developers interested in machine learning and its application in the healthcare industry</div><div><br/></div></div></span>",
