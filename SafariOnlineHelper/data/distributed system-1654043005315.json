    "description": "<span><div><p>Simple tasks like running a program or storing and retrieving data become much more complicated when you do them on collections of computers, rather than single machines. Distributed systems have become a key architectural construct, but they affect everything a program would normally do.</p><p>Using a series of examples taken from a fictional coffee shop operation, this video course with Tim Berglund helps you explore five key areas of distributed systems, including storage, computation, timing, communication, and consensus. You’ll also learn about some distributed programming paradigms.</p><p>If you’re an experienced developer looking to sharpen your architectural skills—particularly with regard to big data—this is one course you shouldn’t miss.</p><ul><li>Dive into the five main problems areas in distributed systems—storage, computation, messaging, timing, and consensus</li><li>Understand key challenges that emerge in each of these areas as you move from single-processor to a distributed architecture</li><li>Discover one or more common open-source products that address each problem area</li></ul><p>Tim Berglund is a full-stack generalist and passionate teacher who loves coding, presenting, and working with people. He’s the founder and principal software developer at August Technology Group, a technology consulting firm focused on the JVM. Tim is an international speaker and co-presenter of the bestselling <i>McCullough and Berglund on Mastering Git</i> (O’Reilly).</p><p><b>About the O’Reilly Software Architecture Series</b></p><p><i>Clearing a path from developer to architect and enriching that path once you arrive. </i>Software architecture is a fast-moving, multidisciplinary subject where entire suites of \"best practices\" become obsolete practically overnight. No single path or curriculum exists, and different types of architecture—application, integration, enterprise—require different subject emphasis. Whether you’re at the outset of a career as an architect or in the midst of such a career, series editor Neal Ford has curated this collection of tools and guides for aspiring and seasoned architects alike.</p></div></span>",

Today, the increasing use of containers has paved the way for core distributed system patterns and reusable containerized components. This practical guide presents a collection of repeatable, generic patterns to help make the development of reliable distributed systems far more approachable and efficient.</p><p>Author Brendan Burns—Director of Engineering at Microsoft Azure—demonstrates how you can adapt existing software design patterns for designing and building reliable distributed applications. Systems engineers and application developers will learn how these long-established patterns provide a common language and framework for dramatically increasing the quality of your system.</p><ul><li>Understand how patterns and reusable components enable the rapid development of reliable distributed systems</li><li>Use the side-car, adapter, and ambassador patterns to split your application into a group of containers on a single machine</li><li>Explore loosely coupled multi-node distributed patterns for replication, scaling, and communication between the components</li><li>Learn distributed system patterns for large-scale batch data processing covering work-queues, event-based processing, and coordinated workflows</li></ul></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><span><span><p>Implementing distributed systems can be hard. Servers crash, become slow, and get partitioned away. These are all events that can happen in a real setting and your distributed system needs to be ready to deal with them.Apache ZooKeeper has been developed to deal with such problems. It is a replicated in-memory system that stores small files called znodes in a hierarchical manner. The ordering guarantees operations over znodes and the notification scheme it provides enables the implementation of a number of commonly used recipes, like master election, group membership, locks, barriers, etc. Without a component like ZooKeeper, implementing such recipes from scratch can be a significant burden because they require sophisticated algorithms with many corner cases that are easy to overlook. ZooKeeper, however, does not make the promise of completely hiding all the problems of a distributed system, but instead to simplify the task.This webcast covers:Some basic concepts of ZooKeeperDesign choices, and caveatsExamples of recipes one can implement with the ZooKeeper APIElaborate on the potential problems with naive recipesDiscuss ways around such problems</p></span></span></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><b>Understand how to apply distributed tracing to microservices-based architectures</b></p><h4>Key Features</h4><ul><li>A thorough conceptual introduction to distributed tracing\n</li><li>An exploration of the most important open standards in the space\n</li><li>A how-to guide for code instrumentation and operating a tracing infrastructure</li></ul><h4>Book Description</h4><p>Mastering Distributed Tracing will equip you to operate and enhance your own tracing infrastructure. Through practical exercises and code examples, you will learn how end-to-end tracing can be used as a powerful application performance management and comprehension tool. \n</p><p>The rise of Internet-scale companies, like Google and Amazon, ushered in a new era of distributed systems operating on thousands of nodes across multiple data centers. Microservices increased that complexity, often exponentially. It is harder to debug these systems, track down failures, detect bottlenecks, or even simply understand what is going on. Distributed tracing focuses on solving these problems for complex distributed systems. Today, tracing standards have developed and we have much faster systems, making instrumentation less intrusive and data more valuable.\n</p><p>Yuri Shkuro, the creator of Jaeger, a popular open-source distributed tracing system, delivers end-to-end coverage of the field in Mastering Distributed Tracing. Review the history and theoretical foundations of tracing; solve the data gathering problem through code instrumentation, with open standards like OpenTracing, W3C Trace Context, and OpenCensus; and discuss the benefits and applications of a distributed tracing infrastructure for understanding, and profiling, complex systems.\n</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>How to get started with using a distributed tracing system\n</li><li>How to get the most value out of end-to-end tracing\n</li><li>Learn about open standards in the space\n</li><li>Learn about code instrumentation and operating a tracing infrastructure\n</li><li>Learn where distributed tracing fits into microservices as a core function</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>Any developer interested in testing large systems will find this book very revealing and in places, surprising. Every microservice architect and developer should have an insight into distributed tracing, and the book will help them on their way. System administrators with some development skills will also benefit. No particular programming language skills are required, although an ability to read Java, while non-essential, will help with the core chapters.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><div><p>In his best-selling book <i>Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</i>, Martin Fowler famously coined the first law of distributed computing—\"Don’t distribute your objects\"—implying that working with this style of architecture can be challenging. A few years ago, Barclays embarked on a journey to migrate its legacy services with the objective of achieving a high level of scale, resilience, and reliability, mainly employing an ecosystem of focused, distributed services. It’s fair to say that the company has discovered through firsthand experience that there’s quite a bit of truth to that statement.</p><p>Prem Chandrasekaran provides an insider scoop on Barclays’s journey deploying services to a private cloud-based infrastructure making use of foundational patterns such as domain-driven design, event-driven architecture (EDA), command query responsibility segregation (CQRS), and event sourcing, among others. Prem recounts some of the challenges faced during the transformation and sheds light on the things that worked well and those that didn’t.</p><p>Topics include:</p><ul><li>How to establish buy-in with senior stakeholders and management</li><li>How to recruit, onboard, and train new team members</li><li>How to establish the boundaries of your teams and services</li><li>How to focus on the right amount and kinds of tests in your pipelines</li><li>How to ensure database and API compatibility</li><li>How to centralize and externalize secrets and configuration</li><li>How to diagnose and pinpoint issues in unattended, asynchronous processes</li><li>How to decide between blue-green and rolling deployments</li><li>How to work with private and public cloud implementations</li></ul><p>This session was recorded at the 2019 O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference in New York.</p></div></span></span></span>",

    "title": "LDAP System Administration",
    "description": "<span><span><div><p>Be more productive and make your life easier. That's what <i>LDAP System Administration</i> is all about.System administrators often spend a great deal of time managing configuration information located on many different machines: usernames, passwords, printer configurations, email client configurations, and network filesystem configurations, to name a few. LDAPv3 provides tools for centralizing all of the configuration information and placing it under your control. Rather than maintaining several administrative databases (NIS, Active Directory, Samba, and NFS configuration files), you can make changes in only one place and have all your systems immediately \"see\" the updated information.Practically platform independent, this book uses the widely available, open source OpenLDAP 2 directory server as a premise for examples, showing you how to use it to help you manage your configuration information effectively and securely. OpenLDAP 2 ships with most Linux® distributions and Mac OS® X, and can be easily downloaded for most Unix-based systems. After introducing the workings of a directory service and the LDAP protocol, all aspects of building and installing OpenLDAP, plus key ancillary packages like SASL and OpenSSL, this book discusses:</p><ul><li>Configuration and access control</li><li>Distributed directories; replication and referral</li><li>Using OpenLDAP to replace NIS</li><li>Using OpenLDAP to manage email configurations</li><li>Using LDAP for abstraction with FTP and HTTP servers, Samba, and Radius</li><li>Interoperating with different LDAP servers, including Active Directory</li><li>Programming using Net::LDAP</li></ul>If you want to be a master of your domain, <i>LDAP System Administration</i> will help you get up and running quickly regardless of which LDAP version you use. After reading this book, even with no previous LDAP experience, you'll be able to integrate a directory server into essential network services such as mail, DNS, HTTP, and SMB/CIFS.</div></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Understand how to use one of the most popular version control systems out there. Mixing shorter, theoretical segments with longer, practically-oriented tasks that give concrete demonstrations of Git in action, this video teaches you motivations and typical goals and then shows you how to achieve them.</p><p>You will begin by learning the principles behind versioning and how versioning is affected by being distributed. After explaining what Git is and giving reasons why you might want to use it, this video then shows how to set up and configure Git before moving onto explaining how to create Git repositories. The basics of working locally are explained before the distributed aspect is then introduced. This leads to a discussion of working with remote repositories, as well as how to track a project’s history and even change it by undoing your actions.</p><p>This video is designed to be appealing both to users who are command-line oriented as well as those who are more comfortable using Git via a graphical interface. Each feature is demonstrated using both methods in a split-screen approach. The tools for carrying out tasks in Git are demonstrated step-by-step, allowing you to see exactly how they should be carried out in real-time.</p><p><b>WHAT YOU WILL LEARN:</b></p><p/><ul><li>The theoretical principles behind Git</li><li>How to install and configure Git</li><li>How to create and clone Git repositories</li><li>How to perform basic tasks including tracking, staging, committing, undoing, and viewing history</li><li>How to work with remote repositories.</li></ul><p/><p><b>WHO THIS VIDEO IS FOR:</b></p><p>The typical viewer would be a software developer with at least basic programming skills and a small amount of experience. They may possibly have worked with other, centralized version control systems. They may, for example, have begun working in a company that has adopted Git, or are getting into open source development, and therefore want to learn how to use Git.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><i>Principles of Computer System Design</i> is the first textbook to take a principles-based approach to the computer system design. It identifies, examines, and illustrates fundamental concepts in computer system design that are common across operating systems, networks, database systems, distributed systems, programming languages, software engineering, security, fault tolerance, and architecture.<br/><br/>Through carefully analyzed case studies from each of these disciplines, it demonstrates how to apply these concepts to tackle practical system design problems. To support the focus on design, the text identifies and explains abstractions that have proven successful in practice such as remote procedure call, client/service organization, file systems, data integrity, consistency, and authenticated messages. Most computer systems are built using a handful of such abstractions. The text describes how these abstractions are implemented, demonstrates how they are used in different systems, and prepares the reader to apply them in future designs.<br/><br/>The book is recommended for junior and senior undergraduate students in Operating Systems, Distributed Systems, Distributed Operating Systems and/or Computer Systems Design courses; and professional computer systems designers.<ul><li>Concepts of computer system design guided by fundamental principles</li><li>Cross-cutting approach that identifies abstractions common to networking, operating systems, transaction systems, distributed systems, architecture, and software engineering</li><li>Case studies that make the abstractions real: naming (DNS and the URL); file systems (the UNIX file system); clients and services (NFS); virtualization (virtual machines); scheduling (disk arms); security (TLS)</li><li>Numerous pseudocode fragments that provide concrete examples of abstract concepts</li><li>Extensive support. The authors and MIT OpenCourseWare  provide on-line, free of charge, open educational resources, including additional chapters, course syllabi, board layouts and slides, lecture videos, and an archive of lecture schedules, class assignments, and design projects</li></ul>\n</span>",

    "description": "<span><p><b>One of the best ways of getting to grips with the world's most popular framework for real-time processing is to study real-world projects. This books lets you do just that, resulting in a sound understanding of the fundamentals.</b></p><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Storm is the most popular framework for real-time stream processing. Storm provides the fundamental primitives and guarantees required for fault-tolerant distributed computing in high-volume, mission critical applications. It is both an integration technology as well as a data flow and control mechanism, making it the core of many big data platforms. Storm is essential if you want to deploy, operate, and develop data processing flows capable of processing billions of transactions.</p><p>\"Storm: Distributed Real-time Computation Blueprints\" covers a broad range of distributed computing topics, including not only design and integration patterns, but also domains and applications to which the technology is immediately useful and commonly applied. This book introduces you to Storm using real-world examples, beginning with simple Storm topologies. The examples increase in complexity, introducing advanced Storm concepts as well as more sophisticated approaches to deployment and operational concerns.</p><p>\"Storm: Distributed Real-time Computation Blueprints\" covers a broad range of distributed computing topics, including not only design and integration patterns, but also domains and applications to which the technology is immediately useful and commonly applied. This book introduces you to Storm using real-world examples, beginning with simple Storm topologies. The examples increase in complexity, introducing advanced Storm concepts as well as more sophisticated approaches to deployment and operational concerns.</p><p>This book covers the domains of real-time log processing, sensor data analysis, collective and artificial intelligence, financial market analysis, Natural Language Processing (NLP), graph analysis, polyglot persistence and online advertising. While exploring distributed computing applications in each of those domains, the book covers advanced Storm topics such as Trident and Distributed State, as well as integration patterns for Druid and Titan. Simultaneously, the book also describes the deployment of Storm to YARN and the Amazon infrastructure, as well as other key operational concerns such as centralized logging.</p><p>By the end of the book, you will have gained an understanding of the fundamentals of Storm and Trident and be able to identify and apply those fundamentals to any suitable problem.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Learn the fundamentals of Storm</li><li>Install and configure storm in pseudo-distributed and fully-distributed mode</li><li>Familiarize yourself with the fundamentals of Trident and distributed state</li><li>Design patterns for data flows in a distributed system</li><li>Create integration patterns for persistence mechanisms such as Titan</li><li>Deploy and run Storm clusters by leveraging YARN</li><li>Achieve continuous availability and fault tolerance through distributed storage</li><li>Recognize centralized logging mechanisms and processing</li><li>Implement polyglot persistence and distributed transactions</li><li>Calculate the effectiveness of a campaign using click-through analysis</li></ul></span>",

With this in mind, deep-diving into less-common OpsMgr features such as Audit Collection Services (ACS), Agentless Exception Monitoring (AEM) and Application Performance Monitoring (APM) has been intentionally omitted.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Install a new System Center 2016 Operations Manager Management Group</li><li>Design and provision custom views to relevant support teams.</li><li>Understand how to deploy agents</li><li>Work with management packs</li><li>Monitor network devices</li><li>Model your IT services with distributed applications</li><li>Create dashboards and custom visualizations</li><li>Tune, optimize, maintain and troubleshoot System Center Operations Manager</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Most modern IT environments comprise a heterogeneous mixture of servers, network devices, virtual hypervisors, storage solutions, cross-platform operating systems and applications. All this complexity brings a requirement to deliver a centralized monitoring and reporting solution that can help IT administrators quickly identify where the problems are and how best to resolve them.</p><p>Using System Center Operations Manager (OpsMgr), administrators get a full monitoring overview of the IT services they have responsibility for across the organization - along with some useful management capabilities to help them remediate any issues they've been alerted to.</p><p>This book begins with an introduction to OpsMgr and its core concepts and then walks you through designing and deploying the various roles. After a chapter on exploring the consoles, you will learn how to deploy agents, work with management packs, configure network monitoring and model your IT services using distributed applications. There's a chapter dedicated to alert tuning and another that demonstrates how to visualize your IT using dashboards. The final chapters in the book discuss how to create alert subscriptions, manage reports, backup and recover OpsMgr, perform maintenance and troubleshoot common problems.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>A beginner's guide that focuses on providing the practical skills required to effectively deploy and administer OpsMgr with walkthrough examples and tips on all the key concepts.</p></span>",

But, since many of these attacks go undisclosed, industry collaboration on ways to combat them has been slow to emerge. This ebook provides engineers and IT managers with techniques for detecting and mitigating ongoing and potential DDoS events.</p><p>Authors Rich Groves and Eric Chou explain how DDoS can disrupt services by flooding your network with traffic from many different sources, often by using a botnet. You’ll learn about the people behind these attacks and their motivations—such as criminals seeking financial gain, thrill and status seekers, and angry and disgruntled users—and ways that you can thwart them.</p><p>The techniques in this ebook enable small to mid-sized organizations to implement DDoS prevention measures on a budget—before the size of your infrastructure requires the services of a commercial DDoS vendor.</p><ul><li>Get an overview of DDoS, including common attacks, botnet-driven attacks, and those that take advantage of IoT devices</li><li>Explore the pros and cons of current DDoS detection methods and mechanisms</li><li>Study the approach to DDoS mitigation at the network and application level, including ways to combat SYN Flood and Classic Flood attacks</li><li>Evaluate cloud-based DDoS detection and mitigation vendors to determine the best fit for your organization</li><li>Learn how to leverage community-based systems to construct a DDoS-focused Threat Intelligence system</li></ul></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>Distributed computing and Java go together naturally. As the first language designed from the bottom up with networking in mind, Java makes it very easy for computers to cooperate. Even the simplest applet running in a browser is a distributed application, if you think about it. The client running the browser downloads and executes code that is delivered by some other system. But even this simple applet wouldn't be possible without Java's guarantees of portability and security: the applet can run on any platform, and can't sabotage its host.Of course, when we think of distributed computing, we usually think of applications more complex than a client and server communicating with the same protocol. We usually think in terms of programs that make remote procedure calls, access remote databases, and collaborate with others to produce a single result. <i>Java Distributed Computing</i> discusses how to design and write such applications. It covers Java's RMI (Remote Method Invocation) facility and CORBA, but it doesn't stop there; it tells you how to design your own protocols to build message passing systems and discusses how to use Java's security facilities, how to write multithreaded servers, and more. It pays special attention to distributed data systems, collaboration, and applications that have high bandwidth requirements.In the future, distributed computing can only become more important.<i>Java Distributed Computing</i> provides a broad introduction to the problems you'll face and the solutions you'll find as you write distributed computing applications.Topics covered in <i>Java Distributed Computing</i>:</p><ul><li>Introduction to Distributed Computing</li><li>Networking Basics</li><li>Distributed Objects (Overview of CORBA and RMI)</li><li>Threads</li><li>Security</li><li>Message Passing Systems</li><li>Distributed Data Systems (Databases)</li><li>Bandwidth Limited Applications</li><li>Collaborative Systems</li></ul></div></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><div>Learn the fundamentals of containerization and get acquainted with Docker. This second edition builds upon the foundation of the first book by revising all the chapters, updating the commands, code, and examples to meet the changes in Docker. It also introduces a new chapter on setting up your application for production deployment and breaks down terminologies like Dockerfile and Docker volumes while taking you on a guided tour of building a telegram bot using Python.</div><div><br/></div><div>You'll start with a brief history of how containerization has changed over the years. Next, we look at how to install (including using the new WSL2 mode) and get started with Docker. The next couple of chapters will focus on understanding the Dockerfile, including the structure and the core instructions used in building a Docker image. You'll also see how to distribute Docker images using Docker hub and other private registries. From there, you'll look at using Docker volumes for persisting data. Then learn how to run multi-container applications with Docker compose and learn inter-container networking works with Docker networks. Finally, you'll look at how to prepare a containerized application for production deployments. </div><div><br/></div><div>Throughout the book you'll apply the techniques learned through the chapters by building a Telegram messenger Chatbot and see how much easier Docker makes it possible to build, release, contribute and distribute an application. In addition, the book shows how optimize the Docker images for production servers by using multi-stage builds and improve the reliability of your services by using health checks and restart policies. <i>Practical Docker with Python</i> will break down terminologies like Dockerfile and Docker volumes, and take you on a guided tour of building a telegram bot using Python. </div><div><br/></div><div><b>What You'll Learn</b></div><div><div><ul><li><div>Compare the difference between containerization and virtualization</div></li><li><div>Understand the Dockerfile and converting your application to Docker image</div></li><li><div>Define and run multi-container applications with Docker compose</div></li><li><div>Review data persistency with Docker volumes</div></li></ul></div><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b></div><div><br/></div><div>Beginner and intermediate developers, DevOps practitioners who are looking improving their build and release workflow by containerizing applications as well as system administrators learning to implement DevOps principles.<br/></div></div><div><br/><br/></div></span>",

Most of the production systems have been built on top of legacy, monolith technologies. The recent popularity of micro-services will not fulfill its promise of decoupled, scalable, and fault-tolerant systems, unless “done right”. While entering the world of micro-services, engineers start building distributed applications, where robust remote procedure calls and cluster coordination are a must.</p><p>You will look at various technologies, algorithms, and design patterns here. Some of them are Service Registry and Discovery, Service Mesh, Apache Cassandra ETCD (coordinator managing Kubernetes clusters), Apache Kafka, Idempotent service design, retry logic, Sharding, and Consistent Hashing, Client-side Load Balancing, Distributed Tracing, Canary Deployment, Sidecar Pattern, Circuit Breaker, and many more. Finally, you will also see the principles of various distributed systems designs; for example, master-less versus with leaders, poll-based versus push-based, immediate versus eventual consistency.</p><p>After completing the course, learning new distributed database technology would be easier, because you will know the commonly reused techniques, including their pros and cons.</p><p><b>Audience</b></p><p>This course is designed for Java developers and architects who wish to broaden their knowledge of distributed computing, NoSQL databases, efficient RPC calls, messaging middleware, and cluster coordination. It is also recommended for anyone working in modern IT landscapes.

    "description": "<span><div>This book teaches you how to evaluate a distributed system from the perspective of immutable objects. You will understand the problems in existing designs, know how to make small modifications to correct those problems, and learn to apply the principles of immutable architecture to your tools.<br/></div><div><br/></div>Most software components focus on the state of objects. They store the current state of a row in a relational database. They track changes to state over time, making several basic assumptions: there is a single latest version of each object, the state of an object changes sequentially, and a system of record exists.<div><br/></div><div>This is a challenge when it comes to building distributed systems. Whether dealing with autonomous microservices or disconnected mobile apps, many of the problems we try to solve come down to synchronizing an ever-changing state between isolated components. Distributed systems would be a lot easier to build if objects could not change.</div><div><br/></div><div>After reading <b><i>The Art of Immutable Architecture</i></b>, you will come away with an understanding of the benefits of using immutable objects in your own distributed systems. You will learn a set of rules for identifying and exchanging immutable objects, and see a collection of useful theorems that emerges and ensures that the distributed systems we build are eventually consistent. Using patterns, you will find where the truth converges, see how changes are associative, rather than sequential, and come to feel comfortable understanding that there is no longer a single source of truth. Practical hands-on examples reinforce how to build software using the described patterns, techniques, and tools. By the end, you will possess the language and resources needed to analyze and construct distributed systems with confidence.<br/></div><div><br/></div> The assumptions of the past were sufficient for building single-user, single-computer systems. But as we expand to multiple devices, shared experiences, and cloud computing, they work against us. It is time for a new set of assumptions. Start with immutable objects, and build better distributed systems.<br/><p></p><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><b>What You Will Learn</b></div><div><ul><li>Evaluate a distributed system from the perspective of      immutable objects </li><li>Recognize the problems in existing designs, and make small      modifications to correct them</li><li>Start a new system from scratch, applying patterns</li>  Apply the principles of immutable architecture to your      tools, including SQL databases, message queues, and the network protocols      that you already use   <li>Discover new tools that natively apply these      principles </li> </ul></div><div><br/></div><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b></div><div><br/></div><div>Software architects and senior developers.

Our traditional SQL database options haven't kept up. Centralized SQL databases, even those with read replicas in the cloud, put all the transactional load on a central system. The further away that a transaction happens from the user, the more the user experience suffers. If the transactional data powering the application is greatly slowed down, fast-loading web pages mean nothing.</p><p>In this report, Paul Modderman, Jim Walker, and Charles Custer explain how distributed SQL fits all applications and eliminates complex challenges like sharding from traditional RDBMS systems.

    "description": "<span><p>With the recent proliferation of service-oriented architectures (SOA), cloud computing technologies, and distributed-interconnected systems, distributed fusion is taking on a larger role in a variety of applications—from environmental monitoring and crisis management to intelligent buildings and defense. Drawing on the work of leading experts around the world, <strong>Distributed Data Fusion for Network-Centric Operations </strong>examines the state of the art of data fusion in a distributed sensing, communications, and computing environment.</p><p><strong><em>Get Insight into Designing and Implementing Data Fusion in a Distributed Network</em></strong></p><p>Addressing the entirety of information fusion, the contributors cover everything from signal and image processing, through estimation, to situation awareness. In particular, the work offers a timely look at the issues and solutions involving fusion within a distributed network enterprise. These include critical design problems, such as how to maintain a pedigree of agents or nodes that receive information, provide their contribution to the dataset, and pass to other network components. The book also tackles dynamic data sharing within a network-centric enterprise, distributed fusion effects on state estimation, graph-theoretic methods to optimize fusion performance, human engineering factors, and computer ontologies for higher levels of situation assessment.</p><p>A comprehensive introduction to this emerging field and its challenges, the book explores how data fusion can be used within grid, distributed, and cloud computing architectures. Bringing together both theoretical and applied research perspectives, this is a valuable reference for fusion researchers and practitioners. It offers guidance and insight for those working on the complex issues of designing and implementing distributed, decentralized information fusion.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><i>Distributed Computing Through Combinatorial Topology</i> describes techniques for analyzing distributed algorithms based on award winning combinatorial topology research. The authors present a solid theoretical foundation relevant to many real systems reliant on parallelism with unpredictable delays, such as multicore microprocessors, wireless networks, distributed systems, and Internet protocols.</p><p>Today, a new student or researcher must assemble a collection of scattered conference publications, which are typically terse and commonly use different notations and terminologies. This book provides a self-contained explanation of the mathematics to readers with computer science backgrounds, as well as explaining computer science concepts to readers with backgrounds in applied mathematics. The first section presents mathematical notions and models, including message passing and shared-memory systems, failures, and timing models. The next section presents core concepts in two chapters each: first, proving a simple result that lends itself to examples and pictures that will build up readers' intuition; then generalizing the concept to prove a more sophisticated result. The overall result weaves together and develops the basic concepts of the field, presenting them in a gradual and intuitively appealing way. The book's final section discusses advanced topics typically found in a graduate-level course for those who wish to explore further. </p><ul><li>Named a 2013 Notable Computer Book for Computing Methodologies by <i>Computing Reviews</i></li><li>Gathers knowledge otherwise spread across research and conference papers using consistent notations and a standard approach to facilitate understanding</li><li>Presents unique insights applicable to multiple computing fields, including multicore microprocessors, wireless networks, distributed systems, and Internet protocols </li><li>Synthesizes and distills material into a simple, unified presentation with examples, illustrations, and exercises </li></ul></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><b>A practicing engineer's inclusive review of communication systems based on shared-bus and shared-memory switch/router architectures</b></p><p>This book delves into the inner workings of router and switch design in a comprehensive manner that is accessible to a broad audience. It begins by describing the role of switch/routers in a network, then moves on to the functional composition of a switch/router. A comparison of centralized versus distributed design of the architecture is also presented. The author discusses use of bus versus shared-memory for communication within a design, and also covers Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms and configuration tools.</p><p>Written in a simple style and language to allow readers to easily understand and appreciate the material presented, <i>Switch/Router Architectures: Shared-Bus and Shared-Memory Based Systems</i> discusses the design of multilayer switches—starting with the basic concepts and on to the basic architectures. It describes the evolution of multilayer switch designs and highlights the major performance issues affecting each design. It addresses the need to build faster multilayer switches and examines the architectural constraints imposed by the various multilayer switch designs. The book also discusses design issues including performance, implementation complexity, and scalability to higher speeds. This resource also:</p><ul><li>Summarizes principles of operation and explores the most common installed routers</li><li>Covers the design of example architectures (shared bus and memory based architectures), starting from early software based designs</li><li>Provides case studies to enhance reader comprehension</li></ul><p><i>Switch/Router Architectures: Shared-Bus and Shared-Memory Based Systems</i> is an excellent guide for advanced undergraduate and graduate level students, as well for engineers and researchers working in the field.</p></span>",

This book will show you how large,<br/>distributed, heterogeneous computer systems can be made to work reliably.<br/>Using transactions as a unifying conceptual framework, the authors show how<br/>to build high-performance distributed systems and high-availability<br/>applications with finite budgets and risk.</p><br/><br/><p>The authors provide detailed explanations of why various problems occur as<br/>well as practical, usable techniques for their solution. Throughout the book,<br/>examples and techniques are drawn from the most successful commercial and<br/>research systems. Extensive use of compilable C code fragments demonstrates<br/>the many transaction processing algorithms presented in the book. The book<br/>will be valuable to anyone interested in implementing distributed systems<br/>or client/server architectures.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Deepen your understanding of blockchain technology and develop your own blockchain applications. This book provides a thorough review of distribution-based systems on blockchain technology, starting from the fundamental concepts that underlie it, all the way through the implementation of a blockchain network for business purposes. </p><p></p><p>Author <b>Joseph Thachil George</b> begins by introducing you to blockchain and some basic concepts of technology, including distributed systems, systems of systems, cyber-physical systems, the Byzantine Consensus, the CAP theorem, and cryptographic techniques. Next, he analyzes the structure of blocks and smart contracts and the mother of all blockchain platforms, Bitcoin. That sets the stage for an examination of transaction structure, validation, and flow, from creation to registration in the ledger and structure of the blocks, the Nakamoto consensus, and finally forks. From there, you’ll experience a deep dive into Ethereum; including the concepts of Gas and Message, smart contracts and the Ethereum virtual machine. From there, you’ll learn about the Ethereum consensus protocol, Ethereum Casper, and the Ethereum Proof-of-Stake algorithm. You’ll then see how blockchain can be connected to a distributed system, followed by a demonstration of how you can model a distributed system using Blockly4SoS and Kilobots. The concluding chapters offer a practical example that combines distributed systems with blockchain technology. </p><p>After reading this book, you will understand how to implement blockchain technology in a distributed system and be able to leverage this knowledge in your own projects. </p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><p></p><ul><li>Learn the concept of blockchains by way of a practical example  </li><li>Grasp the connection between distributed systems and blockchain technology</li><li>Learn the design of blockchain with hyperledger fabric</li><li>Learn the design of cyber-physical systems in a distributed environment </li></ul><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Who Is This Book For</b></p><p>Developers who are enthusiastic about the design and implementation of distributed systems.</p></span>",

It not only refines and expands upon earlier\nstrategies and best practices, it also contains even more concrete\n\"how-to\" information about implementing and deploying them.\"</p><p>—Brad Appleton co-author of <em>Software\nConfiguration Management Patterns: Effective Teamwork, Practical\nIntegration</em></p><p>\"Read this book when you're getting started with configuration\nmanagement (CM); read it again in six months and once more two\nyears later. <em>Software Configuration Management Strategies and\nIBM Rational ClearCase</em> goes beyond the basics to provide a\ncoherent review of CM strategies for projects of all sizes and\ncomplexities.\"</p><p>—Jennie Brown, CM Specialist IBM\nCorporation</p><p>\"This book covers practical software configuration management\n(SCM), ClearCase UCM and ClearCase use for project teams.

The First Edition of\n<em>Software Configuration Management Strategies and Rational\nClearCase</em> established itself as the definitive single source\nfor guidance on both SCM best practices and the market's leading\nproduct, IBM Rational ClearCase. This fully updated Second Edition\nsystematically addresses the latest ClearCase and ClearQuest®\ninnovations, while offering even deeper insight into SCM strategy\nand management.</p><p>The authors each draw on more than 15 years of SCM experience,\nand the knowledge of working with IBM Rational field teams in\ncustomer engagements worldwide. They systematically cover SCM\nplanning and deployment, and SCM's use throughout the entire\nproject lifecycle: development, integration, building, baselining,\nrelease deployment, and beyond. They offer practical guidance on\naddressing challenges that arise as projects grow in size and\ncomplexity, from managing geographically distributed teams to\ntracking change requests.</p><p>Coverage includes</p><ul><li><p>Understanding basic SCM concepts, and the role, value, and\ncomponents of SCM systems</p></li><li><p>Mastering IBM Rational's Unified Change Management (UCM)\nmodel—including today's most effective usage models,\nstrategies, and policy configurations</p></li><li><p>Creating ClearCase repositories and establishing UCM\nenvironments, step-by-step</p></li><li><p>Working as a project manager in the ClearCase environment</p></li><li><p>Leveraging new ClearCase MultiSite and ClearQuest technologies\nto full advantage</p></li><li><p>Using the new ClearCase Remote Client to access centralized\nrepositories across WANs</p></li><li><p>Monitoring ClearCase and tuning it for maximum performance</p></li></ul><p>This book is valuable for everyone concerned with SCM:\ndevelopers who wantSCM to be as intuitive and convenient as\npossible; project managers and technical leaders who must\nefficiently manage change; tools engineers; even IT\nmanagersevaluating SCM technologies.</p><p>© Copyright Pearson Education.

It would be advantageous if you have been through a web application product cycle, although it's not necessary.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Gain proficiency with concurrency and parallelism in Go</li><li>Learn how to test your application using Go's standard library</li><li>Learn industry best practices with technologies such as REST, OpenAPI, Docker, and so on</li><li>Design and build a distributed search engine</li><li>Learn strategies on how to design a system for web scale</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Distributed Computing with Go gives developers with a good idea how basic Go development works the tools to fulfill the true potential of Golang development in a world of concurrent web and cloud applications. Nikhil starts out by setting up a professional Go development environment. Then you'll learn the basic concepts and practices of Golang concurrent and parallel development. </p><p>You'll find out in the new few chapters how to balance resources and data with REST and standard web approaches while keeping concurrency in mind.  Most Go applications these days will run in a data center or on the cloud, which is a condition upon which the next chapter depends. There, you'll expand your skills considerably by writing a distributed document indexing system during the next two chapters. This system has to balance a large corpus of documents with considerable analytical demands. </p><p>Another use case is the way in which a web application written in Go can be consciously redesigned to take distributed features into account. The chapter is rather interesting for Go developers who have to migrate existing Go applications to computationally and memory-intensive environments. The final chapter relates to the rather onerous task of testing parallel and distributed applications, something that is not usually taught in standard computer science curricula.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>Distributed Computing with Go takes you through a series of carefully graded tutorials, building ever more sophisticated applications.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>\"Imagine trying to play defense in football without ever\nstudying offense. You would not know when a run was coming, how to\ndefend pass patterns, nor when to blitz. In computer systems, as in\nfootball, a defender must be able to think like an attacker. I say\nit in my class every semester, you don't want to be the last person\nto attack your own system--you should be the first.</p><p>\"The world is quickly going online. While I caution against\nonline voting, it is clear that online gaming is taking the\nInternet by storm. In our new age where virtual items carry real\ndollar value, and fortunes are won and lost over items that do not\nreally exist, the new threats to the intrepid gamer are all too\nreal. To protect against these hazards, you must understand them,\nand this groundbreaking book is the only comprehensive source of\ninformation on how to exploit computer games. Every White Hat\nshould read it. It's their only hope of staying only one step\nbehind the bad guys.\"</p><p><em>--Aviel D. Rubin, Ph.D.<br/>\nProfessor, Computer Science<br/>\nTechnical Director, Information Security Institute<br/>\nJohns Hopkins University</em></p><p>\"Everyone's talking about virtual worlds. But no one's talking\nabout virtual-world security. Greg Hoglund and Gary McGraw are the\nperfect pair to show just how vulnerable these online games can\nbe.\"</p><p><em>--Cade Metz<br/>\nSenior Editor</em><br/>\nPC Magazine</p><p>\"If we're going to improve our security practices, frank\ndiscussions like the ones in this book are the only way forward. Or\nas the authors of this book might say, when you're facing off\nagainst Heinous Demons of Insecurity, you need experienced\ncompanions, not to mention a Vorpal Sword of Security\nKnowledge.\"</p><p><em>--Edward W. Felten, Ph.D.<br/>\nProfessor of Computer Science and Public Affairs<br/>\nDirector, Center for Information Technology Policy<br/>\nPrinceton University</em></p><p>\"Historically, games have been used by warfighters to develop\nnew capabilities and to hone existing skills--especially in the Air\nForce. The authors turn this simple concept on itself, making games\nthemselves the subject and target of the 'hacking game,' and along\nthe way creating a masterly publication that is as meaningful to\nthe gamer as it is to the serious security system professional.</p><p>\"Massively distributed systems will define the software field of\nplay for at least the next quarter century. Understanding how they\nwork is important, but understanding how they can be manipulated is\nessential for the security professional. This book provides the\ncornerstone for that knowledge.\"</p><p><em>--Daniel McGarvey<br/>\nChief, Information Protection Directorate<br/>\nUnited States Air Force</em></p><p>\"Like a lot of kids, Gary and I came to computing (and later to\ncomputer security) through games. At first, we were fascinated with\nplaying games on our Apple ][s, but then became bored with the few\ngames we could afford. We tried copying each other's games, but ran\nup against copy-protection schemes. So we set out to understand\nthose schemes and how they could be defeated. Pretty quickly, we\nrealized that it was a lot more fun to disassemble and work around\nthe protections in a game than it was to play it.</p><p>\"With the thriving economies of today's online games, people not\nonly have the classic hacker's motivation to understand and bypass\nthe security of games, but also the criminal motivation of cold,\nhard cash. That's a combination that's hard to stop. The first\nstep, taken by this book, is revealing the techniques that are\nbeing used today.\"</p><p><em>--Greg Morrisett, Ph.D.<br/>\nAllen B. Cutting Professor of Computer Science<br/>\nSchool of Engineering and Applied Sciences<br/>\nHarvard University</em></p><p>\"If you're playing online games today and you don't understand\nsecurity, you're at a real disadvantage.

She directs her book at a wide audience, including students, programmers, system designers, and researchers.</p><br/><br/><p><i>Distributed Algorithms</i> contains the most significant algorithms and impossibility results in the area, all in a simple automata-theoretic setting.  The algorithms are proved correct, and their complexity is analyzed according to precisely defined complexity measures.  The problems covered include resource allocation, communication, consensus among distributed processes, data consistency, deadlock detection, leader election, global snapshots, and many others.</p><br/><br/><p>The material is organized according to the system model—first by the timing model and then by the interprocess communication mechanism.  The material on system models is isolated in separate chapters for easy reference.</p><br/><br/><p>The presentation is completely rigorous, yet is intuitive enough for immediate comprehension.  This book familiarizes readers with important problems, algorithms, and impossibility results in the area: readers can then recognize the problems when they arise in practice, apply the algorithms to solve them, and use the impossibility results to determine whether problems are unsolvable.  The book also provides readers with the basic mathematical tools for designing new algorithms and proving new impossibility results.  In addition, it teaches readers how to reason carefully about distributed algorithms—to model them formally, devise precise specifications for their required behavior, prove their correctness, and evaluate their performance with realistic measures.</p></span>",

Patrick offers an overview of how Cassandra works and why it can be a perfect fit for data-driven projects. Patrick then demonstrates that with the addition of Spark and Kafka, you can maintain a highly distributed, fault-tolerant, and scaling solution. You’ll leave with a comprehensive view of the many options to make considered choices in your data pipeline projects.",

    "title": "Practical Event-Driven Microservices Architecture: Building Sustainable and Highly Scalable Event-Driven Microservices",
    "description": "<span><div><p>In the simplest terms, event-driven architectures are like onions; they are manageable as a single layer (like a monolith) but when you get into them, they begin to cascade apart and you quickly realize that there are many complex layers (distributed microservices architecture). And that’s when the tears begin.</p><p>This prescriptive guide takes you through the steps of moving a platform with millions of users from a monolith to a microservices event-driven architecture. You will learn about the challenges and complexities that arise in high-throughput environments that often contain upwards of hundreds of microservices. This book is designed to be your single best resource for learning how to apply event-driven architectures in real-world scenarios and offers hundreds of patterns to overcome the common and not so common challenges.</p><p>While event-driven architectures have been the standard for decoupled, pluggable, evolutionary architectures for years, they have only recently been adopted by enterprises for the purpose of distributed microservices and there is little information about adopting them. Using them at scale can save valuable resources, but requires different considerations, including the added complexity of supporting several moving parts and getting the event schema right from the start in order to avoid large restructuring later on.</p><p>Author Hugo Rocha understands that these kinds of challenges, as well as many others, need to be considered from the beginning, and helps teach you the mindset needed to create a deliberate strategy upfront. This book offers learning approaches and patterns to get you up to speed in order to sustainably build and manage event-driven architectures.</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><p></p><ul><li>Understand the real-world challenges of event-driven architectures and the patterns to deal with those challenges and the trade-offs of each solution</li><li>Leverage the advantages of event-driven architectures to build scalable solutions and address legacy applications</li><li>Plan successful future implementations to avoid common pitfalls and apply proven patterns to deal with challenges in a real-world platform with millions of users</li><li>Decide whether event-driven solutions are the right choice for the requirements at hand</li><li>Discuss and understand advanced concepts about event-driven architectures</li></ul><p></p><p> </p></div><div><b>Who Is This Book For</b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>Software engineers and software architects. Anyone currently working with microservice architectures, primarily event-driven microservices, will greatly benefit from this book. Readers working with monoliths will benefit, as the book explores migration from a monolithic application to an event-driven microservice architecture.<br/></div></span>",

This completely revised Second Edition introduces subspace methods, methods that utilize frequency domain data, and general non-linear black box methods, including neural networks and neuro-fuzzy modeling. The book contains many new computer-based examples designed for Ljung’s market-leading software, System Identification Toolbox for MATLAB.</p><p>Ljung combines careful mathematics, a practical understanding of real-world applications, and extensive exercises. He introduces both black-box and tailor-made models of linear as well as non-linear systems, and he describes principles, properties, and algorithms for a variety of identification techniques:</p><ul><li><p>Nonparametric time-domain and frequency-domain methods.</p></li><li><p>Parameter estimation methods in a general prediction error setting.</p></li><li><p>Frequency domain data and frequency domain interpretations.</p></li><li><p>Asymptotic analysis of parameter estimates.</p></li><li><p>Linear regressions, iterative search methods, and other ways to compute estimates.</p></li><li><p>Recursive (adaptive) estimation techniques.</p></li></ul><p>Ljung also presents detailed coverage of the key issues that can make or break system identification projects, such as defining objectives, designing experiments, controlling the bias distribution of transfer-function estimates, and carefully validating the resulting models.</p><p>The first edition of System Identification has been the field’s most widely cited reference for over a decade. This new edition will be the new text of choice for anyone concerned with system identification theory and practice.</p></div></span></span>",

This sneaks up on you and can leave you without the skills to adequately understand, engage with, and lead your team—which inevitably has a negative effect on your team, and this effect is multiplied as you scale. What if you could reach into the toolbox you use to understand technical problems—software architecture and distributed systems theory—to understand your team? Could you learn to better manage people?</p><p>Andrew Harvey (Microsoft) explores the dynamics of teams and how they map to your understanding of distributed systems. Using this understanding, you can apply distributed systems theory to help unpack some of the dynamics of your team and optimize them for scale. From communication to culture, Andrew breaks down the components of the distributed system, explaining what makes it tick, using things like CAP theorem and the eight fallacies of distributed systems. You’ll walk away with some tools to help understand your team and set yourself up for successful scaling.</p><p>This session was recorded at the 2019 O'Reilly Velocity Conference in San Jose.</p></div></span></span>",

But performance has been an issue for distributed systems like Hadoop, especially when the use cases of a single cluster become multi-tenant or multi-workload. The worst part? You may not even know you have a performance issue. <br/><br/>In this report, Chad Carson and Sean Suchter from Pepperdata describe the performance challenges of running multi-tenant distributed computing environments, especially within a Hadoop context. After examining pros and cons of current solutions for these problems, you’ll learn how to use real-time, intelligent software that tracks and dynamically adjusts each application’s usage of physical hardware. Get ahead of your Hadoop operations for faster, better decision-making and faster, better business returns.<br/><br/>With this report, you’ll explore:</p><ul><li>How Hadoop and other multi-tenant distributed systems work, and why performance matters</li><li>Business-visible symptoms of performance problems: late jobs, inconsistent runtimes, and underutilized hardware</li><li>Scheduling challenges in multi-tenant systems</li><li>Symptoms and solutions for CPU performance limitations</li><li>Physical and virtual limits of node memory—and what happens when you run out</li><li>Identifying and solving performance problems due to disk and network performance limits and other typical bottlenecks</li><li>Solutions for monitoring performance and accurately allocating cluster costs among users and business units</li></ul></div></span>",

Beginning with z/OS V1R7, there are no restrictions for file system structures that should be kept as HFS instead of zFS.</p><p>This IBM Redbooks® publication helps you to install, tailor, and configure new zFS file systems.

The design principles presented are universal and apply to all middleware platforms, including CORBA and Web Services. The authors have created an open-source implementation of CORBA, called MICO, which is freely available on the web.

Under the advanced and visionary approach of distributed intelligence, the authors focus on three distinct but tightly inter-related areas of developments for distributed sensing systems (DSS): firstly, the sensor technology embracing the conversion of the phenomena of interest into desirable form of signal such as electric, secondly, the interaction process between sensing points which requires immense intelligence loosely called networking, and finally, the adoption of useful maturing systems through potential applications for right impacts for a better life and a brighter economy. Furthermore, the book contains a number of case studies and typical applications illustrating the technical details, features and functions of the systems, as well as demonstrating their benefits and limitations.</p><p>Key Features:</p><ul><li><p>Discusses the technological developments lead by sensor technology</p></li><li><p>Addresses viable new applications</p></li><li><p>Contains a number of case studies and typical applications illustrating the technical details, features and functions of the systems</p></li><li><p>Demonstrates the benefits and limitations of distributed sensing</p></li><li><p>Written by experts with vast experience in the field (both in academia and industry)</p></li></ul><p>This book will be an invaluable reference for postgraduates studying related courses (communication engineering, engineering management, computer systems, industrial process, automation, design, environmental, urban, surveillance), R&amp;D engineers, system and application designers, researchers, industrial project managers and engineers, and technical and strategic managers planning new products.</p></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><b>Thoroughly revised and expanded to help readers systematically increase their knowledge and insight about Sigma-Delta Modulators</b></p><p>Sigma-Delta Modulators (SDMs) have become one of the best choices for the implementation of analog/digital interfaces of electronic systems integrated in CMOS technologies. Compared to other kinds of Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs), Σ∆Ms cover one of the widest conversion regions of the resolution-versus-bandwidth plane, being the most efficient solution to digitize signals in an increasingly number of applications, which span from high-resolution low-bandwidth digital audio, sensor interfaces, and instrumentation, to ultra-low power biomedical systems and medium-resolution broadband wireless communications.</p><p>Following the spirit of its first edition, <i>Sigma-Delta Converters: Practical Design Guide, 2nd Edition</i> takes a comprehensive look at SDMs, their diverse types of architectures, circuit techniques, analysis synthesis methods, and CAD tools, as well as their practical design considerations. It compiles and updates the current research reported on the topic, and explains the multiple trade-offs involved in the whole design flow of Sigma-Delta Modulators—from specifications to chip implementation and characterization. The book follows a <i>top-down </i>approach in order to provide readers with the necessary understanding about recent advances, trends, and challenges in state-of-the-art Σ∆Ms. It makes more emphasis on two key points, which were not treated so deeply in the first edition:</p><ul><li>It includes a more detailed explanation of Σ∆Ms implemented using Continuous-Time (CT) circuits, going from system-level synthesis to practical circuit limitations.</li><li>It provides more practical case studies and applications, as well as a deeper description of the synthesis methodologies and CAD tools employed in the design of Σ∆ converters.</li></ul><p><i>Sigma-Delta Converters: Practical Design Guide, 2nd Edition</i> serves as an excellent textbook for undergraduate and graduate students in electrical engineering as well as design engineers working on SD data-converters, who are looking for a uniform and self-contained reference in this hot topic. With this goal in mind, and based on the feedback received from readers, the contents have been revised and structured to make this new edition a unique monograph written in a didactical, pedagogical, and intuitive style. </p></span>",

Presented in three sections—Teletraffic Models of Random Input, Teletraffic Models of Quasi-Random Input, and Teletraffic Models of Batched Poisson Input—it covers everything that a professional experienced with optimization and dimensioning of telecom networks could ever need to know. </p><p>This unique book provides a detailed explanation on how efficient multirate teletraffic loss models are extracted and applied, and guides readers through almost all network technologies and services. Starting from the basics, it steadily increases in difficulty to keep the book self-contained and to provide a better understanding to those who might be new to the subject. It includes detailed explanations of the complex teletraffic models—many of which were developed by the authors. Tutorial examples, several backed by supplementary software, are accompanied by intermediate results and figures. Additionally, end-of-chapter applications describe the applicability of the models to modern network technologies, updating the incorporated teletraffic models of commercial packages/tools.</p><ul><li>Uses the classic EMLM (Erlang Multirate Loss Model) as its base to present a comprehensive range of teletraffic models through detailed explanation and numerical examples</li><li>Filled with the authors’ own original teletraffic models—making for a wholly unique learning experience</li><li>Offers a clear, self-contained presentation with a beginning, middle, and end</li><li>Starts with simple models, then moves to more complex models, before finishing with complicated ones</li><li>Supplemented by an accompanying website with computer implementation of the most important models </li></ul><p>Directed primarily at telecommunication engineers, <i>Efficient Multirate Teletraffic Loss Models Beyond Erlang</i> is also useful for telecom operators or managers on the higher and average levels, as well a Ph.D. students, researchers, and modelers.</p></span>",

They’d like to capitalize on real-time data analysis, move beyond batch processing for time-critical insights, allow multiple users to share cluster resources, and provide predictable service levels. However, fundamental performance limitations of complex distributed systems such as Hadoop prevent much of this from happening.</p><p>In this report, Courtney Webster examines the root cause of these performance problems and explains why best practices for mitigating them—cluster tuning, provisioning, and even cluster isolation for mission critical jobs—don’t provide viable, scalable, or long-term solutions.</p><p>Organizations have been pushing Hadoop and other distributed systems to their performance breaking points as they seek to use clusters as shared resources across multiple business units and individual users. Once they hit this performance wall, companies will find it difficult to deliver on the big data promise at scale.</p><p>Read this report to find out what the implications are for your organization.</p></div></span>",

The truth is that our healthcare system is a sprawling mix of competing interests in which those of the patient are valued least. Too much discussion has devolved to simplistic scapegoating, and too few comprehensive, constructive solutions have been offered. It’s time for a fresh vision.<br/><br/>In straightforward language, <strong>Healthcare at a Turning Point: A Roadmap for Change</strong> outlines a new market-based business model that aligns industry financing mechanisms with the goals of prevention, improved quality, and reduced costs. Drawing on more than 25 years of cross-industry consulting experience, the authors:</p><ul><li>Articulate a market-based vision of the industry</li><li>Examine past efforts to reduce costs, their failures and their unanticipated consequences</li><li>Spotlight perverse incentives that distort the way the healthcare system operates and make it less than it could be</li><li>Present concrete recommendations for change within the healthcare delivery, insurance, pharmaceutical, device and diagnostics sectors</li><li>Explain the changes that employers, consumers and policy makers can make to create a more customer-responsive system that delivers more value</li></ul><p>For all the uncertainty in the current environment, there is also a rare opportunity to fundamentally redefine who wins in this market. <strong>Healthcare at a Turning Point</strong> provides guidance to executives ready for that contest as well as a roadmap for change.</p></span></span>",

Docker allow you to package the many application services that are part of your distributed application into self contained standard packages called containers. With the tool docker-compose developers can then run, scale, test and debug the application, simulating a production like environment on their development workstations.</p><p>This course shows you how Docker can be used to isolate your application services and their dependencies into a single self-contained unit that can reliably run anywhere. You will learn to build, ship and run distributed applications on any platform using Kubernetes as the orchestrator.</p><p>With Docker containers, your applications can run smoothly without you worrying about the environment where they run. This aids in improved security, better scalability, resilience and fault-tolerance, making life easier for developers and operators alike who need a standardized deployment and operations model.</p><p>By the end of this course you will be able to use Docker and Kubernetes to build distributed applications that are scalable, resilient, fault tolerant and secure. Furthermore you will be able to deploy these applications to any Kubernetes cluster running on any platform on premise or in the cloud.</p><p><b>Audience</b></p><p>This video course is for experienced DevOps and software engineers who want to use Docker and Kubernetes to solve many of the hard problems they run into with distributed applications. If you want to keep track of all you application components, orchestrate and administrate them in a consistent way, then you've come to the right place.</p></span>",

It addresses questions such as: </p><ul><p>\n</p><li>How much information is enough for effective distributed decision making?</li><li>Is having more information always useful in terms of system performance?</li><li>What are the individual learning performance bounds under outdated and imperfect measurement?</li><li>What are the possible dynamics and outcomes if the players adopt different learning patterns?</li><li>If convergence occurs, what is the convergence time of heterogeneous learning?</li><li>What are the issues of hybrid learning?</li><li>How can one develop fast and efficient learning schemes in scenarios where some players have more information than the others?</li><li>What is the impact of risk-sensitivity in strategic learning systems?</li><li>How can one construct learning schemes in a dynamic environment in which one of the players do not observe a numerical value of its own-payoffs but only a signal of it?</li><li>How can one learn \"unstable\" equilibria and global optima in a fully distributed manner?</li><p/></ul><p/><p>The book provides an explicit description of how players attempt to learn over time about the game and about the behavior of others. It focuses on finite and infinite systems, where the interplay among the individual adjustments undertaken by the different players generates different learning dynamics, heterogeneous learning, risk-sensitive learning, and hybrid dynamics.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>The IBM® Distributed Virtual Switch 5000V (DVS 5000V) is a\nsoftware-based network switching solution that is designed for use\nwith the virtualized network resources in a VMware enhanced data\ncenter. It works with VMware vSphere and ESXi 5.0 and beyond to\nprovide an IBM Networking OS management plane and advanced Layer 2\nfeatures in the control and data planes. It provides a large-scale,\nsecure, and dynamic integrated virtual and physical environment for\nefficient virtual machine (VM) networking that is aware of server\nvirtualization events, such as VMotion and Distributed Resource\nScheduler (DRS). The DVS 5000V interoperates with any 802.1Qbg\ncompliant physical switch to enable switching of local VM traffic\nin the hypervisor or in the upstream physical switch. Network\nadministrators who are familiar with IBM System Networking switches\ncan manage the DVS 5000V just like IBM physical switches by using\nadvanced networking, troubleshooting, and management features to\nmake the virtual switch more visible and easier to manage.</p><p>This IBM Redbooks® publication helps the network and system\nadministrator install, tailor, and quickly configure the IBM\nDistributed Virtual Switch 5000V (DVS 5000V) for a new or existing\nvirtualization computing environment. It provides several practical\napplications of the numerous features of the DVS 5000V, including a\nstep-by-step guide to deploying, configuring, maintaining, and\ntroubleshooting the device. Administrators who are already familiar\nwith the CLI interface of IBM System Networking switches will be\ncomfortable with the DVS 5000V. Regardless of whether the reader\nhas previous experience with IBM System Networking, this\npublication is designed to help you get the DVS 5000V functional\nquickly, and provide a conceptual explanation of how the DVS 5000V\nworks in tandem with VMware.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>Modern software systems rely on the concepts of concurrency,\nmodularity and distribution, both within the design of the\noperating system and those systems that it supports. Underlying\nthis book is the premise that distributed systems are now\ncommonplace and a reader is more likely to be using one than a\ncentralized time-sharing system. This modern approach therefore\navoids the focus on centralized systems, instead placing the\noperating system within its context and providing an overview of\nsystem components and their relationships.The book is divided into\nfour parts:<br/>\nSystem Design, covering the basic operating system functions and\ndescribing the abstraction and implementation of a system as a\ncommunity of (possibly distributed) concurrent processes.\nDistributed systems are introduced and a chapter on system security\nis included.<br/>\nConcurrency Control in Main Memory, focusing on concurrency control\nin operating systems and application-level systems and exploring\ninter-process communication (IPC) in the context of (distributed)\nsystem design.<br/>\nTransactions, demonstrating the general applicability of concurrent\ncomposite operations.<br/>\nCase Studies, considering different systems in the light of the\nperspective developed in the book: Classical UNIX; Linux, Solaris\nand Contemporary Unix; Extensible Systems; Windows 2000; Web\nProgramming; Middleware; and Transaction Processing Systems.The\nJava language has been used throughout to illustrate\nobject-oriented concepts, concurrent algorithms and distributed\nprogramming and the book includes a chapter on system security. The\ncase studies, covering a full suite of professional operating\nsystems, enable the course to be taught as a blend of theory and\npractice, so that on completion of the course a student is able to\nadapt and build real operating systems that function within a\ndistributed environment.<br/></p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>\"Should you choose to implement zPDT, RDz UT, or RD&amp;T in your team's arsenal, you will find Barrett and Norris's insights, genius, and hard work illuminating as to how to rationally and economically manage the environment.\" —Scott Fagen, Chief Architect—System z Business, CA Technologies</p><p>\"A must-read for anyone interested in successfully deploying cost-efficient zPDT environments with agility in an enterprise that requires simple or complex configurations. The case-study-based exposition of the content allows for its easy consumption and use. Excellent!\" —Mahendra Durai, SVP &amp; Information Technology Officer, CA</p><p><em>Running Mainframe z on Distributed Platforms</em> reveals alternative techniques not covered by IBM for creatively adapting and enhancing multi-user IBM zPDT environments so that they are more friendly, stable, and reusable than those envisaged by IBM. The enhancement processes and methodologies taught in this book yield multiple layers for system recovery, 24×7 availability, and superior ease of updating and upgrading operating systems and subsystems without having to rebuild environments from scratch.</p><p>Most of the techniques and processes covered in this book are not new to either the mainframe or distributed platforms. What is new in this book are the authors' innovative methods for taking distributed environments running mainframe virtual machine (VM) and multiple virtual storage (MVS) and making them look and feel like other MVS systems.</p><p>The authors' combined expertise involves every aspect of the implementation of IBM zPDT technology to create virtualized mainframe environments by which the mainframe operations on a z series server can be transitioned to distributed platforms. All of the enhancement methods consecutively laid out in this book have been architected and developed by the authors for the CA Technologies distributed platform. Barrett and Norris impart these techniques and processes to CIOs and CTOs across the mainframe and distributed fields, to zPDT and RDz UT implementers, and to IBM's independent software vendors and customers.</p><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><p>In particular, readers will learn from <em>Running Mainframe z on Distributed Platforms</em>:</p><li><p>how to create and maintain pristine z/OS and z/VM multi-user sysplexed environments</p></li><li><p>how to establish a mainframe distributed lab with repeatable processes and easy maintenance</p></li><li><p>how to ensure backup/recovery integrity and business continuity</p></li><li><p>standards and conventions, including the use of symbols in the system IPLs</p></li><li><p>z/OS and z/VM optimizations</p></li><li><p>DASD repository methodologies</p></li><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p>CIOs and CTOs across the mainframe and distributed fields, zPDT and RDz UT implementers, administrators and ISVs and customers.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><b>Build and deploy an efficient data processing pipeline for machine learning model training in an elastic, in-parallel model training or multi-tenant cluster and cloud</b></p><h4>Key Features</h4><ul><li>Accelerate model training and interference with order-of-magnitude time reduction</li><li>Learn state-of-the-art parallel schemes for both model training and serving</li><li>A detailed study of bottlenecks at distributed model training and serving stages</li></ul><h4>Book Description</h4><p>Reducing time cost in machine learning leads to a shorter waiting time for model training and a faster model updating cycle. Distributed machine learning enables machine learning practitioners to shorten model training and inference time by orders of magnitude. With the help of this practical guide, you'll be able to put your Python development knowledge to work to get up and running with the implementation of distributed machine learning, including multi-node machine learning systems, in no time. You'll begin by exploring how distributed systems work in the machine learning area and how distributed machine learning is applied to state-of-the-art deep learning models. As you advance, you'll see how to use distributed systems to enhance machine learning model training and serving speed. You'll also get to grips with applying data parallel and model parallel approaches before optimizing the in-parallel model training and serving pipeline in local clusters or cloud environments. By the end of this book, you'll have gained the knowledge and skills needed to build and deploy an efficient data processing pipeline for machine learning model training and inference in a distributed manner.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Deploy distributed model training and serving pipelines</li><li>Get to grips with the advanced features in TensorFlow and PyTorch</li><li>Mitigate system bottlenecks during in-parallel model training and serving</li><li>Discover the latest techniques on top of classical parallelism paradigm</li><li>Explore advanced features in Megatron-LM and Mesh-TensorFlow</li><li>Use state-of-the-art hardware such as NVLink, NVSwitch, and GPUs</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book is for data scientists, machine learning engineers, and ML practitioners in both academia and industry. A fundamental understanding of machine learning concepts and working knowledge of Python programming is assumed. Prior experience implementing ML/DL models with TensorFlow or PyTorch will be beneficial. You'll find this book useful if you are interested in using distributed systems to boost machine learning model training and serving speed.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>This book presents a unified frequency-domain method for the analysis of distributed control systems. The following important topics are discussed by using the proposed frequency-domain method: (1) Scalable stability criteria of networks of distributed control systems; (2) Effect of heterogeneous delays on the stability of a network of distributed control system; (3) Stability of Internet congestion control algorithms; and (4) Consensus in multi-agent systems. This book is ideal for graduate students in control, networking and robotics, as well as researchers in the fields of control theory and networking who are interested in learning and applying distributed control algorithms or frequency-domain analysis methods.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><div>Learn how to use the ASP.NET Core implementation of gRPC, enabling components of your distributed applications to effectively communicate with each other using minimal code.<b> </b>Since the release of ASP.NET Core 3, gRPC has been fully integrated with the system libraries found in ASP.NET Core.<p>gRPC is a network communication technology originally developed by Google. It works over the HTTP2 protocol and it is primarily used to enable communication between microservices in distributed clusters.<br/> </p>\n<p>The beauty of gRPC is that it simplifies all the complex implementation details. You'll see that for a software developer, gRPC can feel like writing code on the client application that can call endpoints on the server application directly, as if both of these are just parts of the same monolithic application. This makes gRPC incredibly easy to use and is the reason why it has become so popular over the last couple of years.</p>\n<p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p>\n<p/><ul><li>Discover the core gRPC concepts that apply to all implementations</li><li>Create a Protobuf message structure</li><li>Use gRPC on ASP.NET Core</li><li>Secure gRPC endpoints</li><li>Apply logging and diagnostics on ASP.NET services that use gRPC</li><li>Update gRPC services to make them backwards-compatible</li></ul><p/>\n<p><b>Who This Video Is For</b></p><p>ASP.NET developers who primarily work on distributed web and cloud applications.

    "description": "<span><p>Master what is sometimes called Git’s killer feature: distributed branching. This is a complex topic that sometimes trips up even seasoned users, so it is covered carefully at a steady pace. The specific practical topics covered are: creating branches, merging branches, and using remote branches. The principles are explained and the features are demonstrated using video examples (command-line and GUI versions presented in split screen).</p><p>As well as these practical issues, the final segments present some additional tips and advice. For one, typical strategies and workflows are explained that you may wish to apply in your own development projects. For another, a summary of more advanced features points the way to learning opportunities for you once you have mastered the intermediate skills from this video. Finally, a short discussion of GitHub introduces you to the basic features and the potential of the world’s most popular Git hosting community.</p><p>The tools for carrying out tasks in Git are demonstrated step-by-step, allowing you to see exactly how they should be carried out in real-time. Also, Git is powerful but can be a complicated system to use. For explaining the complex issues, particularly around repository history, a visual representation is developed.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><p/><ul><li>Discover the principles of distributed branching</li><li>Create and merge branches</li><li>Resolve conflicts between branches</li><li>Create a clean, linear history via rebasing</li><li>Examine typical strategies and workflows used by experienced Git users</li><li>Take a brief tour of GitHub</li></ul><p/><p><b>Who This Video Is For</b></p><p>Software developers with at least basic programming skills and a small amount of experience.

    "title": "Practical Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies: Speed Up Your Application Development Process and Develop Distributed Applications with Confidence",
    "description": "<span><p></p><p>Create cryptocurrency and blockchain applications by examining the key algorithms and concepts pertaining to blockchains, transaction processing, mining, distributed consensus, and anonymous currencies. In this book, you’ll develop a fully functional cryptocurrency from scratch in the Python language. <i><b>Practical Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies</b></i> is a reference for development of blockchain applications and provides you with rigorous information on cryptography and the theory underlying blockchains. </p>This book consists of small chapters that focus on particular topics. You’ll start with a short history of money. Next, you will survey the bitcoin and altcoin ecosystem before delving into cryptographic hash functions, symmetric encryption, public key cryptography, and digital signatures. All the mathematics required to develop blockchain applications is covered. The emphasis is on providing a lucid and rigorous exposition on the nature and working of these constructs. <p></p><p>The next major segment of the book discusses the key concepts and algorithms required to develop blockchain and cryptocurrency applications. There are expositions on blockchain construction, Merkle trees, peer-to-peer networks, cryptocurrency addresses, transactions, and mining. You’ll take a deep dive into the formation of consensus in distributed systems.</p><p>In this book you’ll develop a fully functional cryptocurrency called Helium from scratch in Python. The language requirements are modest since it is presumed that most readers will not be acquainted with Python. The entire source code and unit test code is included in this book.</p><p><i><b>Practical Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies</b></i> interleaves theory and Helium program code chapters in order to demonstrate the practical application of theory in working Helium program code.      </p><p></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What You Will Learn </b>   </p><p></p><ul><li>Gain the mathematical foundations as well as the concepts and algorithms of blockchains and cryptocurrencies</li><li>Implement a cryptocurrency from scratch in Python</li><li>Master the design of distributed blockchain applications    </li></ul><p></p><p></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b>     </p><p> </p><p>Anyone interested in creating cryptocurrency and blockchain applications</p><p></p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Most artificial intelligence research investigates intelligent behavior for a single agent--solving problems heuristically, understanding natural language, and so on. Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) is concerned with coordinated intelligent behavior: intelligent agents coordinating their knowledge, skills, and plans to act or solve problems, working toward a single goal, or toward separate, individual goals that interact. DAI provides intellectual insights about organization, interaction, and problem solving among intelligent agents.  This comprehensive collection of articles shows the breadth and depth of DAI research. The selected information is relevant to emerging DAI technologies as well as to practical problems in artificial intelligence, distributed computing systems, and human-computer interaction. </p><p>\"Readings in Distributed Artificial Intelligence\" proposes a framework for understanding the problems and possibilities of DAI. It divides the study into three realms: the natural systems approach (emulating strategies and representations people use to coordinate their activities), the engineering/science perspective (building automated, coordinated problem solvers for specific applications), and a third, hybrid approach that is useful in analyzing and developing mixed collections of machines and human agents working together. </p><p>The editors introduce the volume with an important survey of the motivations, research, and results of work in DAI. This historical and conceptual overview combines with chapter introductions to guide the reader through this fascinating field. A unique and extensive bibliography is also provided.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Distributed Artificial Intelligence presents a collection of papers describing the state of research in distributed artificial intelligence (DAI). DAI is concerned with the cooperative solution of problems by a decentralized group of agents. The agents may range from simple processing elements to complex entities exhibiting rational behavior.</p><p>The book is organized into three parts. Part I addresses ways to develop control abstractions that efficiently guide problem-solving; communication abstractions that yield cooperation; and description abstractions that result in effective organizational structure. Part II describes architectures for developing and testing DAI systems. Part III discusses applications of DAI in manufacturing, office automation, and man-machine interactions.</p><p>This book is intended for researchers, system developers, and students in artificial intelligence and related disciplines. It can also be used as a reference for students and researchers in other disciplines, such as psychology, philosophy, robotics, and distributed computing, who wish to understand the issues of DAI.</p></span>",

The text illustrates methods that ensure the most accurate results in computational modeling for electric power distribution systems. It clearly explains the principles and mathematics behind system models and discusses the \"smart grid\" concept and its special benefits. Including numerous models of components and several practical examples, the chapters demonstrate how engineers can apply and customize computer programs to help them plan and operate systems. The book also covers approximation methods to help users interpret computer program results, and includes references and assignments that help users apply Mathcad and WindMil programs to put their new learning into practice. </p></span>",

The first part deals with techniques for programming in shared-memory based systems. The book covers concepts in Java such as threads, synchronized methods, waits, and notify to expose students to basic concepts for multi-threaded programming. It also includes algorithms for mutual exclusion, consensus, atomic objects, and wait-free data structures.<br/> The second part of the book deals with programming in a message-passing system. This part covers resource allocation problems, logical clocks, global property detection, leader election, message ordering, agreement algorithms, checkpointing, and message logging. Primarily a textbook for upper-level undergraduates and graduate students, this thorough treatment will also be of interest to professional programmers.\n   \n  </span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><i>Adaptive Learning Methods for Nonlinear System Modeling</i> presents some of the recent advances on adaptive algorithms and machine learning methods designed for nonlinear system modeling and identification. Real-life problems always entail a certain degree of nonlinearity, which makes linear models a non-optimal choice. This book mainly focuses on those methodologies for nonlinear modeling that involve any adaptive learning approaches to process data coming from an unknown nonlinear system. By learning from available data, such methods aim at estimating the nonlinearity introduced by the unknown system. In particular, the methods presented in this book are based on online learning approaches, which process the data example-by-example and allow to model even complex nonlinearities, e.g., showing time-varying and dynamic behaviors. Possible fields of applications of such algorithms includes distributed sensor networks, wireless communications, channel identification, predictive maintenance, wind prediction, network security, vehicular networks, active noise control, information forensics and security, tracking control in mobile robots, power systems, and nonlinear modeling in big data, among many others.</p><p>This book serves as a crucial resource for researchers, PhD and post-graduate students working in the areas of machine learning, signal processing, adaptive filtering, nonlinear control, system identification, cooperative systems, computational intelligence. This book may be also of interest to the industry market and practitioners working with a wide variety of nonlinear systems. </p><ul><li>Presents the key trends and future perspectives in the field of nonlinear signal processing and adaptive learning.</li><li>Introduces novel solutions and improvements over the state-of-the-art methods in the very exciting area of online and adaptive nonlinear identification.</li><li>Helps readers understand important methods that are effective in nonlinear system modelling, suggesting the right methodology to address particular issues.</li></ul></span>",

Their experiential emphasis, expressed in their close analysis of sample algorithms throughout the book, aims to equip engineers, students of engineering, and system designers to design and create new and more efficient machine learning systems. Readers of <em>Efficient Learning Machines</em> will learn how to recognize and analyze the problems that machine learning technology can solve for them, how to implement and deploy standard solutions to sample problems, and how to design new systems and solutions.</p><p>Advances in computing performance, storage, memory, unstructured information retrieval, and cloud computing have coevolved with a new generation of machine learning paradigms and big data analytics, which the authors present in the conceptual context of their traditional precursors. Awad and Khanna explore current developments in the deep learning techniques of deep neural networks, hierarchical temporal memory, and cortical algorithms.</p><p>Nature suggests sophisticated learning techniques that deploy simple rules to generate highly intelligent and organized behaviors with adaptive, evolutionary, and distributed properties. The authors examine the most popular biologically-inspired algorithms, together with a sample application to distributed datacenter management. They also discuss machine learning techniques for addressing problems of multi-objective optimization in which solutions in real-world systems are constrained and evaluated based on how well they perform with respect to multiple objectives in aggregate. Two chapters on support vector machines and their extensions focus on recent improvements to the classification and regression techniques at the core of machine learning.</p></span></span>",

It examines the theory of numerical simulation methods such as the EMTP (circuit-theory based approach) and numerical electromagnetic analysis. The book highlights transients in clean or sustainable energy systems such as smart grids and wind farms, since they require a different approach than overhead lines and cables. Simulation examples provided include arcing horn flashover, a transient in a grounding electrode, and an induced voltage from a lightning channel. </p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>How much warehouse space will your company\nneed throughout the year? That’s a brutally complex\nquestion--and companies that get it wrong can waste huge amounts of\nmoney. In <em>Developing a Warehouse and Inventory Level\nOptimization System</em>, Frank A. Tillman and Deandra Cassone\nintroduce a complete model for answering this question more\naccurately and minimizing warehousing costs without introducing\nexcessive costs elsewhere. Tillman and Cassone help you accurately\nproject how much inventory you’ll need to house to avoid\nstockouts, by accurately analyzing the demand pattern of each\nproduct at the wholesaler level throughout the year and\nestablishing the demand distributions and inventory requirements to\ncover service for each level of product at each wholesaler. Their\nsequential analysis establishes the safety stock and inventory\nlevels required to support the desired service level to each\nwholesaler. Products are next measured as they flow through\nmanufacturing, packaging, warehousing, and distribution to\ndynamically determine the optimal Full Goods Days Inventory as an\noutput of the system. Tillman and Cassone’s sophisticated\nsimulation approach goes beyond conventional linear programming\nallocation of resources, helping decision-makers project inventory\nbuild-up on a shift-by-shift basis. Their model can help companies\nprioritize products and allocate resources to maximize profit and\ncustomer satisfaction within existing demand and capacity\nconstraints and makes possible detailed scheduling of products\nthrough the system.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>As world activities become more integrated, the rate of data\ngrowth has been increasing exponentially. And as a result of this\ndata explosion, current data management methods can become\ninadequate. People are using the term big data (sometimes referred\nto as Big Data) to describe this latest industry trend. IBM®\nis preparing the next generation of technology to meet these data\nmanagement challenges.</p><p>To provide the capability of incorporating big data sources and\nanalytics of these sources, IBM developed a stream-computing\nproduct that is based on the open source computing framework Apache\nHadoop. Each product in the framework provides unique capabilities\nto the data management environment, and further enhances the value\nof your data warehouse investment.</p><p>In this IBM Redbooks® publication, we describe the need for\nbig data in an organization. We then introduce IBM InfoSphere®\nBigInsights™ and explain how it differs from standard Hadoop.\nBigInsights provides a packaged Hadoop distribution, a greatly\nsimplified installation of Hadoop and corresponding open source\ntools for application development, data movement, and cluster\nmanagement. BigInsights also brings more options for data security,\nand as a component of the IBM big data platform, it provides\npotential integration points with the other components of the\nplatform.</p><p>A new chapter has been added to this edition. Chapter 11\ndescribes IBM Platform Symphony®, which is a new scheduling\nproduct that works with IBM Insights, bringing low-latency\nscheduling and multi-tenancy to IBM InfoSphere BigInsights.</p><p>The book is designed for clients, consultants, and other\ntechnical professionals.</p></span>",

These organizations require enterprise-class solutions capable of addressing immediate storage needs cost-effectively, while providing an upgrade path for future requirements. IBM® System Storage® N series storage systems and their software capabilities are designed to meet these requirements.</p><p>IBM System Storage N series storage systems offer an excellent solution for a broad range of deployment scenarios. IBM System Storage N series storage systems function as a mulitprotocol storage device that is designed to allow you to simultaneously serve both file and block-level data across a single network. These activities are demanding procedures that, for some solutions, require multiple, separately managed systems. The flexibility of IBM System Storage N series storage systems, however, allows them to address the storage needs of a wide range of organizations, including distributed enterprises and data centers for midrange enterprises. IBM System Storage N series storage systems also support sites with computer and data-intensive enterprise applications, such as database, data warehousing, workgroup collaboration, and messaging.</p><p>This IBM® Redbooks® publication explains the software features of the IBM System Storage N series storage systems. This book also covers topics such as installation, setup, and administration of those software features from the IBM System Storage N series storage systems and clients and provides example scenarios.</p></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>In this IBM Redbooks publication, we assume that you have a\ngeneral familiarity with IBM eServer zSeries technology and\nterminology. We do not assume that you have an in-depth\nunderstanding of z/VM and Linux. This book is written for those who\nwant to get a quick start with z/VM and Linux on the mainframe.</p><p>This book describes how to set up your own Linux virtual servers\non zSeries and IBM System z9 under z/VM. It adopts a cookbook\nformat that provides a clearly documented set of procedures for\ninstalling and configuring z/VM in a logical partition (LPAR) and\nthen installing and customizing Linux.</p><p>You require a zSeries LPAR with associated resources, such as a\nz/VM 5.2 media, and a Linux distribution. This book is based on Red\nHat Enterprise Linux 4 for zSeries and it addresses both 31-bit and\n64-bit distributions.</p><p>In addition, there are a few associated REXX EXECs and Linux\nscripts to help speed up the process. These tools, which are on the\nWeb, are not IBM products, but they are informally supported. They\nare available on the Web.</p><p>Please note that the additional material referenced in the text is not available from IBM.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>As 5G transforms mobile usage and services, network professionals will need to significantly evolve their transport network architectures towards greater sophistication and stronger integration with radio networks, and facilitate transition towards cloud-native 5G mobile core. Until now, however, most guides to 5G have foregrounded its RF/radio and mobile core innovations, not its implications for data networks. <strong><em>A Network Architect’s Guide to 5G</em></strong> fills the gap,giving network architects, designers, and engineers essential knowledge for designing and planning their own 5G-ready networks.</p><p>Drawing on decades of experience with global service providers and enterprise networks, the authors illuminate new and evolving network technologies necessary for building 5G-capable networks, such as segment routing, network slicing, Timing and Synchronization, distributed data centers for edge computing, integration with public cloud, and more. They explain how 5G blurs boundaries between mobile core, radio access, and transport, as well as the changes in the composition of a traditional cell site with the adoption of Open and Virtualized RAN resulting in a transition to mobile xHaul. Every chapter builds on earlier coverage, culminating in a “big picture” presentation of a complete 5G network design.</p><ul><li><p>Understand the evolution of mobile technologies over the generation leading to 5G’s foundational concepts and principles.</p></li><li><p>Explore 5G changes to Radio Access Networks (RAN), the Mobile Core, Mobile Transport, and the need for tighter integration between them.</p></li><li><p>Use Segment Routing to architect simplified, SDN-capable networks, and enable network slicing for 5G.</p></li><li><p>Rethink transport design to incorporate Far-Edge, Edge, and public-cloud based data centers augmenting centralized DCs to support distributed peering and Multi-access Edge Compute.</p></li><li><p>Provide guidance to meet the criteria and requirements for various aspects of Fronthaul, Midhaul, and Backhaul architecture, such as transport protocol evaluation, latency consideration, routing design, QoS modeling, network device selection, and more.</p></li><li><p>Forge a cohesive 5G network architecture by combining mobile communications principles with advanced transport technologies.</p></li></ul></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>This book provides an overview of the high availability and\nenterprise replication features of Informix Dynamic Server (IDS)\nVersion 10, which can simplify and automate enterprise database\ndeployment. Version 10 offers patent-pending technology that\nvirtually eliminates downtime and automates many of the tasks\nassociated with deploying mission-critical enterprise systems. The\nhigh availability capability can reduce or eliminate costly\ndowntime through, as examples, the introduction of online index\nrebuild, the capability to create and drop indexes online without\nlocking tables, and point-in-time table-level restore. Enhanced\nenterprise replication provides solutions for those customers\nrequiring reliable and quick dissemination of data across a global\norganization. The replicated data can also participate in the high\navailability environment with capabilities such as seamless online\nresynchronization of enterprise replication nodes at startup, for\nexample. There is also enhanced capability for high-availability\ndisaster recovery customers in the form of the ability to resend\nprimary server indexes to HDR secondary servers without requiring a\nrebuild of the index on the primary server. These significant and\npowerful capabilities can enable you to intelligently replicate\n(distribute) your enterprise data to improve the availability of\nthat data to better service the requirements of your\nenterprise.</p></span>",

This book will help full-stack and Java developers build modular, high-performing, and reactive microservice-based apps using the Micronaut framework.</p><p>You'll start by building microservices and learning about the core components, such as ahead-of-time compilation, reflection-less dependency injection, and reactive baked-in HTTP clients and servers. Next, you will work on a real-time microservice application and learn how to integrate Micronaut projects with different kinds of relational and non-relational databases. You'll also learn how to employ different security mechanisms to safeguard your microservices and integrate microservices using event-driven architecture in the Apache Kafka ecosystem.
