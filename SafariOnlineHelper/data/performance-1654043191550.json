    "description": "<span><div><p>Want your web site to display more quickly? This book presents 14 specific rules that will cut 25% to 50% off response time when users request a page. Author Steve Souders, in his job as Chief Performance Yahoo!, collected these best practices while optimizing some of the most-visited pages on the Web. Even sites that had already been highly optimized, such as Yahoo! Search and the Yahoo! Front Page, were able to benefit from these surprisingly simple performance guidelines.</p><p>The rules in <em>High Performance Web Sites</em> explain how you can optimize the performance of the Ajax, CSS, JavaScript, Flash, and images that you've already built into your site -- adjustments that are critical for any rich web application. Other sources of information pay a lot of attention to tuning web servers, databases, and hardware, but the bulk of display time is taken up on the browser side and by the communication between server and browser. <em>High Performance Web Sites</em> covers every aspect of that process.</p><p>Each performance rule is supported by specific examples, and code snippets are available on the book's companion web site. The rules include how to:<br/></p><ul><li>Make Fewer HTTP Requests</li><li>Use a Content Delivery Network</li><li>Add an Expires Header</li><li>Gzip Components</li><li>Put Stylesheets at the Top</li><li>Put Scripts at the Bottom</li><li>Avoid CSS Expressions</li><li>Make JavaScript and CSS External</li><li>Reduce DNS Lookups</li><li>Minify JavaScript</li><li>Avoid Redirects</li><li>Remove Duplicates Scripts</li><li>Configure ETags</li><li>Make Ajax Cacheable</li></ul><p>If you're building pages for high traffic destinations and want to optimize the experience of users visiting your site, this book is indispensable.</p><p>\"If everyone would implement just 20% of Steve's guidelines, the Web would be adramatically better place. Between this book and Steve's YSlow extension, there's reallyno excuse for having a sluggish web site anymore.\"</p><p>-Joe Hewitt, Developer of Firebug debugger and Mozilla's DOM Inspector</p><p>\"Steve Souders has done a fantastic job of distilling a massive, semi-arcane art down to a set of concise, actionable, pragmatic engineering steps that will change the world of web performance.\"</p><p>-Eric Lawrence, Developer of the Fiddler Web Debugger, Microsoft Corporation</p></div></span>",

    "description": "<span>This book is a collection of developer code recipes and best practices for persisting data using Spring, particularly Spring Boot. The book is structured around practical recipes, where each recipe discusses a performance case or performance-related case, and almost every recipe has one or more applications. Mainly, when we try to accomplish something (e.g., read some data from the database), there are several approaches to do it, and, in order to choose the best way, you have to know the implied trades-off from a performance perspective. You’ll see that in the end, all these penalties slow down the application. Besides presenting the arguments that favor a certain choice, the application is written in Spring Boot style which is quite different than plain Hibernate.<p></p>\n\nPersistence is an important set of techniques and technologies for accessing and using data, and this book demonstrates that data is mobile regardless of specific applications and contexts. In Java development, persistence is a key factor in enterprise, ecommerce, cloud and other transaction-oriented applications. <p></p><p></p>\n<p>After reading and using this book, you'll have the fundamentals to apply these persistence solutions into your own mission-critical enterprise Java applications that you build using Spring.</p><p></p>\n<p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><p></p>\n<p></p><ul><li>Shape *-to-many associations for best performances</li><li>Effectively exploit Spring Projections (DTO) </li><li>Learn best practices for batching inserts, updates and deletes </li><li>Effectively fetch parent and association in a single SELECT</li><li>Learn how to inspect Persistent Context content</li><li>Dissect pagination techniques (offset and keyset)</li><li>Handle queries, locking, schemas, Hibernate types, and more</li></ul><p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p> <p><b>Who This Book Is For</b> </p><p>Any Spring and Spring Boot developer that wants to squeeze the persistence layer performances.</p></span>",

Through the central character, readers witness (and learn from) real-world conversations and situations that are commonplace in an everyday business environment. The characters are fictitious, but the story comes from the author's own experience and real accounts.</p><p>Each chapter ends with valuable lessons and conclusions drawn from events in the narrative, giving the reader a wealth of real-world, practical advice on what works, what fails, and the common traps and pitfalls to anticipate and avoid during an implementation project.</p><p>People with little or no ITIL<sup>®</sup> experience, or even a limited IT background, will find this book interesting, entertaining and, above all, extremely useful in understanding the means to a successful implementation of a KPI management system.</p><p><strong>\"I really enjoyed it.

    "description": "<span><span><span><p>The emergence of the cloud and modern, fast corporate networks demands that you perform judicious balancing of computational loads. <em>Practical Load Balancing</em> presents an entire analytical framework to increase performance not just of one machine, but of your entire infrastructure.</p><p><em>Practical Load Balancing</em> starts by introducing key concepts and the tools you'll need to tackle your load-balancing issues. You'll travel through the IP layers and learn how they can create increased network traffic for you. You'll see how to account for persistence and state, and how you can judge the performance of scheduling algorithms. </p><p>You'll then learn how to avoid performance degradation and any risk of the sudden disappearance of a service on a server. If you're concerned with running your load balancer for an entire network, you'll find out how to set up your network topography, and condense each topographical variety into recipes that will serve you in different situations. You'll also learn about individual servers, and load balancers that can perform cookie insertion or improve your SSL throughput. </p><p>You'll also explore load balancing in the modern context of the cloud. While load balancers need to be configured for high availability once the conditions on the network have been created, modern load balancing has found its way into the cloud, where good balancing is vital for the very functioning of the cloud, and where IPv6 is becoming ever more important.</p><p>You can read <em>Practical Load Balancing</em> from end to end or out of sequence, and indeed, if there are individual topics that interest you, you can pick up this book and work through it once you have read the first three chapters.</p></span></span></span>",

But today, agile web development practices mean that you can\nalmost launch on an idea and figure it out as you go. At least\nthat’s what authors Jason Glaspey and Scott Kveton and their\ncolleague Michael Richardson did when starting bacn.com, an online\nbacon retailer.<br/><br/>\nIn this mouth-watering tale, they describe their process of\nstarting a business on a shoestring, including the things they did\nright and the things they did wrong. Bacn.com didn’t make\nthem millionaires — not even close! But the lessons they\nlearned have led to comfortable success on their follow-up\nventures. And whether it’s choosing a domain name or\nselecting the right content management systems, buying and storing\ninventory or figuring out fulfillment, using social media for\nmarketing or finding a location to host an “epic”\nparty, their stories will help you jumpstart your own web\nbusiness.</p></span></span>",

A reliable, informative,\nand responsive web site can reduce cost, increase visibility, and\ncreate a positive image for the owner of that site. Behind every\nsuccessful web page is an overworked and underappreciated\nwebmaster. Webmasters make sure that the information on a site is\naccessible and usable; that the site is always available; that\nperformance is good; that users can get the information that they\nneed; and that the site can collect the information it needs to\nserve those users. These disparate tasks require many different\ntools and skills. <em>Webmaster in a Nutshell</em> pulls together in\na single volume all the essential reference information for\nwebmasters working on UNIX-based web servers. In this second\nedition of <em>Webmaster in a Nutshell</em>, we've updated our\nmaterial to include the latest versions of HTML and Javascript, and\nalso expanded the book to cover the newest technologies emerging on\nthe Web. The book covers:\n</p><ul><li><p>HTML 4.0, with special attention to forms, tables and\nframes</p></li><li><p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</p></li><li><p>XML, the next-generation markup language for the Web</p></li><li><p>CGI, with a chapter dedicated to the Perl module CGI.pm</p></li><li><p>JavaScript 1.2</p></li><li><p>PHP, the HTML-embedded programming language</p></li><li><p>HTTP 1.1, the underlying protocol that drives the Web</p></li><li><p>Apache server administration, including Apache modules</p></li><li><p>mod_perl, the Apache module for enhancing CGI</p></li><li><p>performance and providing a Perl\ninterface to the Apache API</p></li></ul><p><em>Webmaster in a Nutshell</em>, part of the bestselling O'Reilly\nseries of reference books, makes it easy to find the information\nyou want about the technologies you use.

Achingly slow sites with annoying overlays, cookie agreements, instant notifications, and obtrusive ads litter the web landscape.</p><p>While there may be some excuses for complex web applications, there's little justification for sluggish content-based and ecommerce sites. People are notoriously impatient, and an unresponsive site receives fewer visitors and conversions.</p><p>This practical, short book provides advice, tips, and best practice for improving website performance, ranging from quick, five-minute configuration changes to major website overhauls. We primarily concentrate on front-end activities and server configurations to optimize the code delivered to a browser. Some back-end tips are provided, but this is often specific to your application, framework, database, and usage patterns. Server-side performance can often be improved with additional or more powerful computing resources.</p><p>Ideally, everyone involved in a project would consider performance from the start. Somewhat understandably, that rarely occurs, because no one can appreciate the speed of a website or application before it's been created. Many of the tips contained in this book can therefore be applied after your project has been delivered.</p></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><span><span><p><i>The Truth About Employee Engagement </i>was originally published as <i>The Three Signs of a Miserable Job. </i><b><br/><br/>A bestselling author and business guru tells how to improve job satisfaction and performance. </b></p><p>In his sixth fable, bestselling author Patrick Lencioni takes on a topic that almost everyone can relate to: job misery. Millions of workers, even those who have carefully chosen careers based on true passions and interests, dread going to work, suffering each day as they trudge to jobs that make them cynical, weary, and frustrated. It is a simple fact of business life that any job, from investment banker to dishwasher, can become miserable. Through the story of a CEO turned pizzeria manager, Lencioni reveals the three elements that make work miserable -- irrelevance, immeasurability, and anonymity -- and gives managers and their employees the keys to make any job more engaging.</p><p>As with all of Lencioni’s books, this one is filled with actionable advice you can put into effect immediately. In addition to the fable, the book includes a detailed model examining the three root causes of job misery and how they can be remedied. It covers the benefits of managing for job engagement within organizations -- increased productivity, greater retention, and competitive advantage -- and offers examples of how managers can use the applications in the book to deal with specific jobs and situations.</p><p>Patrick Lencioni is President of The Table Group, a management consulting firm specializing in executive team development and organizational health. As a consultant and keynote speaker, he has worked with thousands of senior executives and executive teams in organizations ranging from Fortune 500 companies to high-tech startups to universities and nonprofits. His clients include. AT&amp;T, Direct TV, JCPenney, Microsoft, Nestle, Northwestern Mutual, Southwest Airlines and St. Jude Chilren’s Research Hospital.  Lencioni is the author of ten bestselling books, including <i>The Five Dysfunctions of a Team </i>and<i> The Advantage</i>. He previously worked for Oracle, Sybase, and the management consulting firm Bain &amp; Company.</p></span></span></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><div>Do you supervise people? If so, this book is for you.<br/><br/>One of a manager’s toughestand most importantresponsibilities is to evaluate an employee’s performance, providing honest feedback and clarifying what they’ve done well and where they need to improve.<br/><br/>In How to Be Good at Performance Appraisals, Dick Grote provides a concise, hands-on guide to succeeding at every step of the performance appraisal processno matter what performance management system your organization uses. Through step-by-step instructions, examples, do-and-don’t bullet lists, sample dialogues, and suggested scripts, he shows you how to handle every appraisal activity from setting goals and defining job responsibilities to evaluating performance quality and discussing the performance evaluation face-to-face.<br/><br/>Based on decades of experience guiding managers through their biggest challenges, Grote helps answer the questions he hears most often:<br/><br/>  How do I set goals effectively? How many goals should someone set?<br/>  How do I evaluate a person’s behaviors? Which counts more, behaviors or results? <br/>  How do I determine the right performance appraisal rating? How do I explain my rating to a skeptical employee?<br/>  How do I tell someone she’s not meeting my expectations? How do I deliver bad news?<br/><br/>Grote also explains how to tackle other thorny performance management tasks, including determining compensation and terminating poor performers. <br/><br/>In accessible and useful language, How to Be Good at Performance Appraisals will help you handle performance appraisals confidently and successfully, no matter the size or culture of your organization. It’s the one book you need to excel at this daunting yet critical task.    <br/></div></span>",

Kerth\nguides readers through productive, empowering retrospectives of\nproject performance.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether your shop calls them postmortems or postpartums or\nsomething else, project retrospectives offer organizations a formal\nmethod for preserving the valuable lessons learned from the\nsuccesses and failures of every project. These lessons and the\nchanges identified by the community will foster stronger teams and\nsavings on subsequent efforts.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a retrospective to be effective and successful, though, it\nneeds to be safe. Kerth shows facilitators and participants how to\ndefeat the fear of retribution and establish an air of mutual\ntrust. One tool is Kerth's Prime Directive: Regardless of what we\ndiscover, we must understand and truly believe that everyone did\nthe best job he or she could, given what was known at the time, his\nor her skills and abilities, the resources available, and the\nsituation at hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nApplying years of experience as a project retrospective facilitator\nfor software organizations, Kerth reveals his secrets for managing\nthe sensitive, often emotionally charged issues that arise as teams\nrelive and learn from each project.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p><b>Joel, Apress, Blogs, and Blooks</b></p><p>...I was learning the hard way about how to be a publisher and probably spending way too much time looking at web sites and programming than I should have in response to that. Anyway, one day I came across this web site called , which was run by a guy with strong opinions and an unusual, clever writing style, along with a willingness to take on the conventional wisdom. In particular, he was writing this ongoing series about how bad most user interfaces were—mostly because programmers by and large knew, as Joel and I would say, using the same Yiddish–derived NYC vernacular that we both share, “bupkis” about what users really want. And I, like many, was hooked both by the series and the occasional random essay that Joel wrote. And then I had this epiphany: I'm a publisher, I like reading his stuff, why not turn it into a book?...</p><p>Read the complete Foreword</p><p> — Gary Cornell, Cofounder, Apress</p><p>Since the release of the bestselling title Joel on Software in 2004, requests for a sequel have been relentless. So, we went back to the famed JoelonSoftware.com archives and pulled out a new batch of favorites, many of which have been downloaded over one million times. With Joel’s newest book, <em>More Joel on Software</em>, you’ll get an even better (not to mention updated) feast of Joel’s opinions and impressions on software development, software design, running a software business, and so much more.</p><p>This is a new selection of essays from the author’s web site, http://www.joelonsoftware.com.</p><p><b>Joel Spolsky</b> started his weblog in March 2000 in order to offer his insights, based on years of experience, on how to improve the world of programming. This weblog has become infamous among the programming world, and is linked to more than 600 other web sites and translated into 30+ languages!</p><p>Spolsky’s extraordinary writing skills, technical knowledge, and caustic wit have made him a programming guru. With the success of <em>Joel on Software</em>, there has been a strong demand for additional gems and advice, and this book is the answer to those requests.</p><p>Containing a collection of all–new articles from the original, <em>More Joel on Software</em> has even more of an edge than the original, and the tips for running a business or managing people have far broader application than the software industry. We feel it is safe to say that this is the most useful book you will buy this year.</p><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><ul><li><p>The best approaches to managing and hiring extraordinary people</p></li><li><p>Advice for those interested in the software industry as a career and for managers who want to get them</p></li><li><p>Joel’s unique impressions of how to create products and design—good and bad</p></li><li><p>An “in the trenches” look at how to start and run an effective software business (or any business for that matter)</p></li><li><p>A true sense of what it takes to create a differentiated, unique, motivated organization</p></li></ul><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p>Anyone interested in the software business will truly enjoy this book, but in particular this should be required reading for managers of technical businesses.</p></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>Are you still designing web sites like it's 1999? If so, you're in for a surprise. Since the last edition of this book appeared five years ago, there has been a major climate change with regard to web standards.  Designers are no longer using (X)HTML as a design tool, but as a means of defining the meaning and structure of content. Cascading Style Sheets are no longer just something interesting to tinker with, but rather a reliable method for handling all matters of presentation, from fonts and colors to the layout of the entire page. In fact, following the standards is now a mandate of professional web design.</p><p>Our popular reference, <i>Web Design in a Nutshell</i>, is one of the first books to capture this new web landscape with an edition that's been completely rewritten and expanded to reflect the state of the art. In addition to being an authoritative reference for (X)HTML and Cascading Style Sheets, this book also provides an overview of the unique requirements of designing for the Web and gets to the nitty-gritty of JavaScript and DOM Scripting, web graphics optimization, and multimedia production. It is an indispensable tool for web designers and developers of all levels.</p><p>The third edition covers these contemporary web design topics:</p><ul><li>Structural layer: HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 (9 chapters), including an alphabetical reference of all elements, attributes and character entities</li><li>Presentation layer: Ten all-new chapters on Cascading Style Sheets, Level 2.1, including an alphabetical reference of all properties and values.</li><li>Behavior layer: JavaScript and scripting with the Document Object Model (DOM)</li><li>Web environment: New web standards, browsers, display devices, accessibility, and internationalization</li><li>Web graphics optimization: Producing lean and mean GIF, JPEG, PNG, and animated GIFs</li><li>Multimedia: Web audio, video, Flash, and PDF</li></ul><p>Organized so that readers can find answers quickly, <i>Web Design in a Nutshell</i>, Third Edition helps experienced designers come up to speed quickly on standards-based web design, and serves as a quick reference for those already familiar with the new standards and technology.</p><p>There are many books for web designers, but none that address such a wide variety of topics. Find out why nearly half a million buyers have made this the most popular web design book available.</p></div></span>",

In this book you will begin by installing and configuring PostgreSQL on a server by focusing on system-level parameter settings before installation. You will also look at key post-installation steps to avoid issues in the future. The basic configuration of PostgreSQL is tuned for compatibility rather than performance. Keeping this in mind, you will fine-tune your PostgreSQL parameters based on your environment and application behavior. You will then get tips to improve database monitoring and maintenance followed by database security for handling sensitive data in PostgreSQL. </p><p>Every system containing valuable data needs to be backed-up regularly. PostgreSQL follows a simple back-up procedure and provides fundamental approaches to back up your data. You will go through these approaches and choose the right one based on your environment. Running your application with limited resources can be tricky. To achieve this you will implement a pooling mechanism for your PostgreSQL instances to connect to other databases. Finally, you will take a look at some basic errors faced while working with PostgreSQL and learn to resolve them in the quickest manner. </p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Configure      PostgreSQL for performance</li>  Monitor      and maintain PostgreSQL instances  <li>Implement      a backup strategy for your data</li>  Resolve      errors faced while using PostgreSQL </ul></div><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Readers with basic knowledge of PostgreSQL who wish to implement key solutions based on their environment.<br/></div></span>",

Using the story approach popularized by Ken Blanchard in his many bestsellers, this unique parenting book draws on the experiences of two of the coauthors—as both pioneering marine mammal trainers and as parents—to show how the same principles that induce killer whales to leap into the air can persuade young children to go quietly to bed. <br/><br/>Like Amy and her husband Matt, once you get the hang of the three Whale Done principles, you'll see a dramatic difference in overcoming challenges like following bedtime routines, dealing with tantrums, introducing new foods, sharing, avoiding overuse of the word no, learning to care for a pet, and instituting time-outs.\n  </span>",

Now in its third edition, this bestselling guide provides a model for simplifying KPIs and avoiding the pitfalls ready to trap the unprepared organization. New information includes guidance toward defining critical success factors, project leader essentials, new tools including worksheets and questionnaires, and real-world case studies that illustrate the practical application of the strategies presented. The book includes a variety of templates, checklists, and performance measures to help streamline processes, and is fully supported by the author's website to provide even more in-depth information.</p><p>Key Performance Indicators are a set of measures that focus on the factors most critical to an organization's success. Most companies have too many, rendering the strategy ineffective due to overwhelming complexity. <em>Key Performance Indicators</em> guides readers toward simplification, paring down to the most fundamental issues to better define and measure progress toward goals. Readers will learn to:</p><li><p>separate out performance measures between those that can be tied to a team and result in a follow-up phone call (performance measures) and those that are a summation of a number of teams working together (result indicators)</p></li><li><p>look for and eradicate those measures that have a damaging unintended consequence, a major darkside</p></li><li><p>Sell a KPI project to the Board, the CEO, and the senior management team using best practice leading change techniques</p></li><li><p>Develop and use KPIs effectively with a simple five stage model</p></li><li><p>Ascertain essential performance measures, and develop a reporting strategy</p></li><li><p>Learn the things that a KPI project leader needs to know</p></li><p>A KPI project is a chance at a legacy - the project leader, facilitator, or coordinator savvy enough to craft a winning strategy can affect the organization for years to come. KPI projects entail some risk, but this book works to minimize that risk by arming stakeholders with the tools and information they need up front. Key Performance Indicators helps leaders shape a performance measurement initiative that works.</p></span></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>Squid is the most popular Web caching software in use today, and it works on a variety of platforms including Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows.  Squid improves network performance by reducing the amount of bandwidth used when surfing the Web.  It makes web pages load faster and can even reduce the load on your web server.  By caching and reusing popular web content, Squid allows you to get by with smaller network connections.  It also protects the host on your internal network by acting as a firewall and proxying your internal web traffic.  You can use Squid to collect statistics about the traffic on your network, prevent users from visiting inappropriate web sites at work or school, ensure that only authorized users can surf the Internet, and enhance your privacy by filtering sensitive information from web requests.  Companies, schools, libraries, and organizations that use web-caching proxies can look forward to a multitude of benefits.Written by Duane Wessels, the creator of Squid, <i>Squid: The Definitive Guide</i> will help you configure and tune Squid for your particular situation.  Newcomers to Squid will learn how to download, compile, and install code.  Seasoned users of Squid will be interested in the later chapters, which tackle advanced topics such as high-performance storage options, rewriting requests, HTTP server acceleration, monitoring, debugging, and troubleshooting Squid.Topics covered include:</p><ul><li>Compiling and installing Squid</li><li>Running Squid</li><li>Using Squid's sophisticated access controls</li><li>Tuning disk storage for optimal performance</li><li>Configuring your operating system for HTTP interception</li><li>Forwarding Requests to other web caches</li><li>Using redirectors to rewrite user requests</li><li>Monitoring Squid with the cache manager and SNMP</li><li>Using Squid to accelerate and protect HTTP servers</li><li>Managing bandwidth consumption with Delay Pools</li></ul></div></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p>\nOn the World Wide Web, speed and efficiency are vital. Users have\nlittle patience for slow web pages, while network administrators\nwant to make the most of their available bandwidth. A properly\ndesigned web cache reduces network traffic and improves access\ntimes to popular web sites--a boon to network administrators and\nweb users alike. <em>Web Caching</em> hands you all the technical\ninformation you need to design, deploy, and operate an effective\nweb caching service. It starts with the basics of how web caching\nworks, from the HTTP headers that govern cachability to cache\nvalidation and replacement algorithms. Topics covered in this book\ninclude:\n</p><ul><li><p>Designing an effective cache solution</p></li><li><p>Configuring web browsers to use a cache</p></li><li><p>Setting up a collection of caches that can talk to\neach other</p></li><li><p>Configuring an interception cache or proxy</p></li><li><p>Monitoring and fine-tuning the performance of a\ncache</p></li><li><p>Configuring web servers to cooperate with web\ncaches</p></li><li><p>Benchmarking cache products</p></li></ul><p>\nThe book also covers the important political aspects of web\ncaching, including privacy, intellectual property, and security\nissues. Internet service providers, large corporations, or\neducational institutions--in short, any network that provides\nconnectivity to a wide variety of users--can reap enormous benefit\nfrom running a well-tuned web caching service. <em>Web Caching</em>\nshows you how to do it right.\n</p></span></span></span>",

Every day, more and more users turn to the Internet\nto use resource-hungry applications like video and audio on-demand\nand distributed games. At the same time, more and more computer\napplications are built to rely on the Web, but with much higher\nsensitivity to delays of even a few milliseconds. The key to\nsatisfying these growing demands and expectations lies in the\npractices of caching and replication and in the increased\nscalability solutions they represent.</p><p><em><b>Web Caching and Replication</b></em> provides\nessential material based on the extensive real-world experience of\ntwo experts from AT&amp;T Labs. This comprehensive examination of\ncaching, replication, and load-balancing practices for the Web\nbrings together information from and for the commercial world,\nincluding real-life products; technical standards communities, such\nas IETF and W3C; and academic research.</p><p>By focusing on the underlying, fundamental ideas\nthat are behind the varied technologies currently used in caching\nand replication, this book will remain a relevant, much-needed\nresource as the multi-billion dollar industries that rely on the\nWeb continue to grow and evolve.</p><p>The book approaches its two central topics in two\ndistinct parts. The part on caching includes coverage of:</p><li><p>Proxy caching, including latency reduction and TCP connection\ncaching</p></li><li><p>Transparent and nontransparent proxy deployment</p></li><li><p>Cooperative caching</p></li><li><p>Cache consistency</p></li><li><p>Replacement policies</p></li><li><p>Prefetching</p></li><li><p>\"Caching the uncacheable\"</p></li><p>The part on replication includes coverage of:</p><li><p>Basic mechanisms for request distribution, including\ncontent-blind and content-aware request distribution</p></li><li><p>CDNs, including DNS request distribution, streaming content\ndelivery, and secure content access</p></li><li><p>Server selection</p></li><p>Examples and illustrations are included throughout\nthe book. Extensive cross-referencing also enables readers to\nidentify the corresponding parts of each section. <b><em>Web Caching\nand Replication</em></b> concludes with a thorough look into the\nfuture. It not only considers how new services can be implemented\non caching and replication platforms, but also outlines emerging\ntechnologies that will allow for cooperation between different\ncaching and replication enterprises in order to improve the overall\nperformance of the Web.</p><p><br/><br/>\n0201615703B11262001</p></span></span></span>",

Management wants to maximize returns and obtain reliable performance data, customers demand better service and insist on sites that are more advanced yet easier to use, and the Web site must increasingly be integrated with the entire business even as the amount of information it handles continues to grow.<br/><br/><b>Maintaining and Evolving Successful Commercial Web Sites</b> focuses more on process, reality, and pragmatism and less on strategic theory. It provides the reader with the knowledge, tools, approaches, and processes to manage key site maintenance and evolution projects, providing answers to the following questions:<br/><br/>*How can I better manage changes and updates to the Web site?<br/>*How can I scale up to allow more contributions to the site and more content and still maintain quality and control?<br/>*What is content management and how do I go about it?<br/>*How do I go about personalization or community building?<br/>*What is Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and how do I actually do it online?<br/>*How do I measure and report on how well the site is doing?<br/>*How do I avoid information overload?<br/>*How do I maximize the value the site creates?<br/><br/>The book includes case studies to demonstrate candidly how the issues discussed in the book translate into reality.<br/><br/>*Case studies show candidly how the issues discussed translate into reality. <br/>*Describes content management &amp; Customer Relationship Management (CRM) how to go about implementing them. <br/>*Teaches how to measure &amp; report on how well the site is doing, how to avoid information overload, &amp; how to maximize the value the site creates.\n</span>",

In the\nbook’s foreword, <em>Peopleware</em> authors Tom DeMarco and\nTimothy Lister rave, “We believe this is a book that needs to\nbe on the desk of just about anyone who manages\nanything.”</p><p>Because people often react with\nunanticipated sophistication when they are being measured,\nmeasurement-based management systems can become dysfunctional,\ninterfering with achievement of intended results. Fortunately, as\nthe author shows, measurement dysfunction follows a pattern that\ncan be identified and avoided.</p><p>The author’s findings are bolstered by\ninterviews with eight recognized experts in the use of measurement\nto manage computer software development: David N. Card, of Software\nProductivity Solutions; Tom DeMarco, of the Atlantic Systems Guild;\nCapers Jones, of Software Productivity Research; John Musa, of\nAT&amp;T Bell Laboratories; Daniel J. Paulish, of Siemens Corporate\nResearch; Lawrence H. Putnam, of Quantitative Software Management;\nE. O.

Baumohl\nmiraculously breathes life into economic indicators and\nstatistics.”</p><p>–<em>The Wall Street Journal</em></p><p>“This is the most up-to-date guide to\neconomic indicators and their importance to financial markets in\nprint. The coverage of less-reported indicators, especially those\nfrom nongovernment sources, is hard to find elsewhere. The\ninclusion of the actual published tables helps the newer student of\nthe markets find the data in the public release. For anyone trying\nto follow the economic data, this should be next to your computer\nso that you can understand and find the data on the\nInternet.”</p><p>–David Wyss, Chief Economist, Standard\nand Poor’s</p><p>“I find Baumohl’s writing\nfascinating. In addition to the famous indicators, he includes many\nthat I hadn’t heard of. I really appreciate that he tells you\nexactly where to find each indicator on the Web. Just about anyone\nwho’s serious about understanding which way the economy is\nheaded will want to read this book. It could be a\nclassic.”</p><p>–Harry Domash, Columnist for <em>MSN\nMoney</em> and Publisher, <em>Winning Investing Newsletter</em></p><p>“Bernie Baumohl has accomplished\nsomething of real value in <em>The Secrets of Economic\nIndicators</em>. He has successfully demystified the world of\nfinancial and economic news that bombards us in our daily lives.\nBoth professional investors and casual observers of the world of\nfinance and economics will be grateful for what he has done. The\nconstant stream of heretofore bewildering news from the world of\nbusiness and finance can now be easily understood. Every\nbusinessperson or investor should keep a copy of Baumohl’s\nbook close at hand as he or she catches up on the business, stock\nmarket, and economic events of the day. It is great, at long last,\nto have someone who has eliminated what may have been so perplexing\nto so many and to have done so with such remarkable\nclarity.”</p><p>–Hugh Johnson, Chairman and Chief\nInvestment Officer of Johnson Illington Advisors</p><p>“Bernie Baumohl has written a\nmust-read educational and reference book that every individual\ninvestor will find indispensable for watching, monitoring, and\ninterpreting the markets. The daily flow of high frequency economic\nindicators is the stuff that makes financial markets move and that\ncan signal the big trends that make or break investor portfolios.\nMost important, Bernie’s long experience in reporting\neconomics for <em>Time Magazine</em> helps make the ‘dismal\nscience’ lively and interesting.”</p><p>–Allen Sinai, President and Chief\nGlobal Economist, Decision Economics, Inc.</p><p>“Baumohl has a gift for taking a\ncomplicated subject and allowing it to read like a fast-moving\nnovel. My confidence in reading and understanding economic\nindicators as portrayed in this book made me realize the\npossibilities this information holds for improving my personal net\nworth as well as navigating my business toward higher profits. I\nrecommend this book if you care about your future\nfinances.”</p><p>–Morris E. Lasky, CEO, Lodging\nUnlimited, Inc.; Manager and consultant for $6 billion in hotel\nassets; Chairman, Lodging Conference; Chairman, International Hotel\nConference</p><p>“I think this is an excellent book.\nIt’s well written, accessible to a variety of readers, deals\nwith an interesting and important subject, and covers the topic\nwell. It deserves to get a lot of notice and use.”</p><p>–D. Quinn Mills, Alfred J.\nWeatherhead, Jr., Professor of Business Administration, Harvard\nBusiness School</p><p>“Economic statistics, employment data,\nFederal Reserve surveys. Think they are boring? Think again! They\ncan drive markets into a frenzy, causing billions of dollars to be\nmade or lost in an instant. Bernie Baumohl brilliantly, clearly,\nand, yes, entertainingly describes what every investor and business\nmanager should know about economic indicators: which ones move\nmarkets, how to interpret them, and how to use them to spot and\ncapitalize on future economic trends. <em>The Secrets of Economic\nIndicators</em> is an extraordinary and insightful work–an\nenormously important contribution to the body of financial\nliterature. Read it and then keep it on your desk. Consult it the\nnext time you are deluged with a flurry of economic statistics.\nYour understanding certainly will be enhanced, and your portfolio\nwill likely be as well.”</p><p>–Robert Hormats, Vice Chairman,\nGoldman Sachs (International)</p><p>“If you want to make money investing,\nthis is an essential trend-tracking tool that will help get you to\nthe bank. This book is the real deal.

    "title": "Agile Performance Improvement: The New Synergy of Agile and Human Performance Technology",
    "description": "<span><span><p/><p><em>Agile Performance Improvement</em> demonstrates the mutual benefits that accrue to the worlds of performance consulting and agile software development when the values and principles of both are blended synergistically under the guidance of practitioners skilled in both. The agile performance improvement model blends the principles of human performance technology with the frameworks and practices of Agile. The result is an approach that maximizes the value of interactions among the consultant, the work team, and the customer. Unlike traditional end-to-end waterfall processes, agile performance improvement delivers value continuously and in small increments, relentlessly focusing on outcomes of value to the customer. Building on structures of Agile that are used in software development, such as Scrum, the agile performance improvement model considers the human component of holistic solutions in establishing a continuous stream of value.</p><p>Bob Winter, a performance consultant, was the product owner for the corporate education scrum supporting an agile transition initiative for hundreds of engineering teams. From this cross-disciplinary experience, he discovered that the two cultures, two languages, and two methodologies of performance consulting and agile software development are—far from being incongruent, incompatible, or irrelevant to each other—in fact ideally suited to complement and support each other. Being agile improves the effectiveness of the performance consultant, and applying the lessons of human performance technology improves the effectiveness of software development teams.</p><p>In <em>Agile Performance Improvement</em>, Winter teaches performance consultants how to apply agile principles, values, and methods usefully to the tasks of optimizing human performance in areas of practice not only adjoining but also well beyond the realm of software and IT engineering, such as corporate learning solutions, human resources systems, and non-software products. Conversely, he shows engineering teams immersed in an agile environment how to boost their performance using the principles and techniques taught and cultivated by performance consultants. The author, who has worked extensively on both sides of the traditional divide, recounts entertainingly but informatively how both sparks and fur can fly when geeks encounter people people.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>The age of the distributed team is upon us. Teams can now operate and collaborate from locations other than a central office, and events surrounding the 2020 COVID pandemic have thrown its practicality into sharp relief. Managing a team whose members are distributed across several locations requires a different mindset and will remain a must-have for all areas of business from this point forward.</p><p><i>Building and Managing High-Performance Distributed Teams</i> explains what the <i>distributed teams</i> concept means to the future of your company. Author Alberto S. Silveira Jr. leverages his industry knowledge to explore why the high-performance distributed team model is vital to the future of business, and explains how to build and maintain one through times of change. You will learn to differentiate between distributed teams, remote work, offshoring, and what each means in a modern context. Silveira also weaves in stories from his other life as a boater and sailor, using analogies and lessons gained from humankind’s thousands of years of maritime adventure to illustrate the value of well-managed teams, and to also convey the importance of life-work balance in today’s working world.</p><p>The book analyzes team management strategies from some of the great successes and failures in recent years so that you can learn from the experiences of others. <i>Building and Managing High-Performance Distributed Teams</i> is your definitive guide for building a dynamic distributed team, using collaboration technology to attract and engage the most important element of any business—your people. Whether you are a department head, a business owner, or a team leader, this book presents the no-nonsense knowledge you need now to chart your course for success.</p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><p></p><ul><li>Understand what the new era of connected business means, and the role distributed teams will play.</li><li>Differentiate between distributed teams, remote work, nearshore, and offshoring, and what each means to modern business.</li><li>Discover the true heart of a high-performance distributed team (hint: it’s not the technology).</li><li>Find out what the era of distributed teams means to existing infrastructure.</li><li>Uncover what we can learn about team management from some of the great successes and failures of recent years.</li><li>Appreciate the techniques honed by seafarers, pilots, and software designers combined to create a successful project plan for team management and company navigation.</li><li>Comprehend the effective simplicity of the “power of three” in building successful teams.</li><li>Apply proven techniques of measurement and metrics without leaving the human factor behind to improve team morale and productivity.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>Team leaders or officers of small-ish companies, with populations in the tens through to the mid-hundreds.

You'll gain the basics and be ready to move to the next level: web and mobile apps. While you won't learn the specifics of programming web and mobile apps, you will have the foundation to take your Dart skills in that direction.</p><p>This book starts with an introduction to the Dart IDE, after which you will take a look at the various components of the Dart programming language. You will look at types and variables, and get to know the significance of collections and arrays in Dart. Once you've familiarized yourself with the initial components of Dart, you will see how flow of control and looping can be achieved by using if, else, and conditional expressions. Moving on to functions and objects, you will dig deeper into the concepts of object oriented programming to gauge the importance of constructors in Dart. You will then discover more about inheritance and mixins, seeing how they contain methods for use by other classes. <br/></p><p>After gauging the importance of abstract classes and methods, you will learn more about anonymous functions such as lambdas and closures. You will then take a look at key data structures including lists and maps to aid you in organizing your information for storage and retrieval. After all this you’ll move on to managing exceptions arising from executing your program. Finally, Dart programming relies heavily on libraries to perform a variety of functions. You will cover some of these packages and libraries, including dart:core and dart:math, and also build a backend server with the help of the Dart core libraries.</p> <b>What You Will Learn</b> <p></p><ul><li>Use variables and conditionals in Dart</li><li>Work with arrays and collections </li><li>Apply flow control and looping</li><li>Explore data structures and their use</li><li>Handle exceptions</li><li>Use Dart packages and libraries to build a backend server</li></ul><p></p><b><br/></b><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Those new to Dart programming who aim to get a quick introduction to its concepts and programming principles.

A balancing act between easily implementing complex applications and keeping their performance optimal is a present-day need. In this book, we explore how to achieve this crucial balance while developing and deploying applications with Java EE 8. </p><p>The book starts by analyzing various Java EE specifications to identify those potentially affecting performance adversely. Then, we move on to monitoring techniques that enable us to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize performance metrics. Next, we look at techniques that help us achieve high performance: memory optimization, concurrency, multi-threading, scaling, and caching. We also look at fault tolerance solutions and the importance of logging. Lastly, you will learn to benchmark your application and also implement solutions for continuous performance evaluation.</p><p>By the end of the book, you will have gained insights into various techniques and solutions that will help create high-performance applications in the Java EE 8 environment.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This book will cover vital concepts implemented through a sample application built throughout the book. This will enable you to apply these concepts to suit your software requirements.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book You can download the example code files for all Packt books you have purchased from your account at http://www.PacktPub.com.

    "title": "Unfear: Transform Your Organization to Create Breakthrough Performance and Employee Well-Being",
    "description": "<span><b>Two top experts on high-performing organizations show you how to reframe your—and your employees’—relationship with fear and anxiety to create a learning culture of engaged workers at the top of their game.</b>Fear and uncertainty have been undermining performance and well-being in the workplace for as long as we have had workplaces. Here’s a little-known fact of business: mismanaged fear is responsible for almost all of the dysfunction that most organizations experience. While fear can drive short-term results, it does so at the cost of high employee burnout and turnover. It also undermines long-term business performance. But we can’t eradicate it entirely; it is inherent to the human condition. Winning organizations aren’t fear-free; they know how to reframe fear into opportunities for learning and growth. They create resilient cultures of unfear.In this timely and essential guide, McKinsey alumni Gaurav Bhatnagar and Mark Minukas show leaders:<ul><li>The impact of fear, its biological underpinnings, and the archetypes through which it is expressed as patterns of behavior in organizations</li><li>The strategies, techniques, and actions to bring about an unfear transformation</li><li>The process begins with yourself—how to become an unfear individual</li><li>Transformation doesn’t start with systems and structures but with mindsets and behavior—how to build unfear teams</li><li>Employee well-being leads to high performance for your business—how to build unfear organizations</li></ul>\n\nThis proven approach to workplace anxiety reduces stress, boosts engagement, and overcomes obstacles that get in the way of success. It leads to personal rewards greater profits, and sustainable growth. This is only possible with a culture of unfear.\n\n  </span>",

    "description": "<span><p>One of a manager's toughest-and most important-responsibilities is to evaluate an employee's performance, providing honest feedback and clarifying what they've done well and where they need to improve.</p>\n\n<p>In How to Be Good at Performance Appraisals, Dick Grote provides a hands-on guide to succeeding at every step of the performance appraisal process-no matter what performance management system your organization uses. Through step-by-step instructions, examples, do-and-don't lists, sample dialogues, and suggested scripts, he shows you how to handle every appraisal activity, from setting goals and defining job responsibilities to evaluating performance quality and discussing the performance evaluation face-to-face.</p>\n\n<p>Based on decades of experience guiding managers through their biggest challenges, Grote helps answer the questions he hears most often: How do I set goals effectively? How many goals should someone set? How do I evaluate a person's behaviors? Which counts more, behaviors or results? How do I determine the right performance appraisal rating? How do I explain my rating to a skeptical employee? How do I tell someone she's not meeting my expectations? and How do I deliver bad news? Grote also explains how to tackle other thorny performance management tasks, including determining compensation and terminating poor performers.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><b>Explores and brings together the existent body of knowledge on building performance analysis</b></p><p>Building performance is an important yet surprisingly complex concept. This book presents a comprehensive and systematic overview of the subject. It provides a working definition of building performance, and an in-depth discussion of the role building performance plays throughout the building life cycle. The book also explores the perspectives of various stakeholders, the functions of buildings, performance requirements, performance quantification (both predicted and measured), criteria for success, and the challenges of using performance analysis in practice.</p><p><i>Building Performance Analysis </i>starts by introducing the subject of building performance: its key terms, definitions, history, and challenges. It then develops a theoretical foundation for the subject, explores the complexity of performance assessment, and the way that performance analysis impacts on actual buildings. In doing so, it attempts to answer the following questions: What is building performance? How can building performance be measured and analyzed? How does the analysis of building performance guide the improvement of buildings? And what can the building domain learn from the way performance is handled in other disciplines?</p><ul><li>Assembles the current body of knowledge on building performance analysis in one unique resource</li><li>Offers deep insights into the complexity of using building performance analysis throughout the entire building life cycle, including design, operation and management</li><li>Contributes an emergent theory of building performance and its analysis</li></ul><p><i>Building Performance Analysis </i>will appeal to the building science community, both from industry and academia.

    "description": "<span>\n    Rethink, Redesign, Reboot.<br/><br/>Most people associate performance management with the annual review, which is universally dreaded by employees, management, and HR professionals alike. It's a cookie-cutter, fear-based, top-down approach that emphasizes negatives over positives and stifles healthy career conversations. It's never been shown to motivate anyone to do anything but try to avoid it, but nobody feels like they have any alternative. Tamra Chandler has one—and it works. <br/><br/>Actually, Chandler doesn't offer a single alternative—she offers an infinite number of them. Each organization that uses her Performance Management Reboot is able to develop its own unique version since it doesn't make a lot of sense for organizations with different cultures, in different industries and sectors, to do things exactly the same way. Grounded in the latest scientific findings about motivation, it's a transparent, employee-driven process that values collaboration over competition and rewards people for acquiring new skills and increasing their contribution instead of hitting arbitrary benchmarks. <br/><br/>Chandler lays out the general principles and then walks you through each step in creating a performance management process that employees will actually embrace rather than avoid and that will help you meet the three objectives of great performance management: developing your people, rewarding them equitably, and driving your organization's performance. It's the first comprehensive, step-by-step guide to creating a performance management solution that's tailored to your organization's needs and goals and that places the emphasis squarely on your greatest asset: your people.<br/>\n  </span>",

In this report, Tom Barker—Senior Director of Software Engineering and Development at Comcast—discusses concrete steps you can take as a business leader to elevate the status of web performance in your organization.</p><p>Customers are ruthless when it comes to assessing sites. Even if you think your application is functioning just fine, the mere <i>perception</i> of poor performance will cause customers to go elsewhere. This report outlines the importance of web performance and explains how your involvement as an executive can help spark company-wide involvement in this valuable process.</p><p>You’ll explore how to:</p><ul><li>Set annual goals for creating and maintaining performance service-level agreements (SLAs)</li><li>Identify champions in the company who can serve as grass roots organizers driving web performance</li><li>Implement tactical changes to help your organization achieve web performance goals</li><li>Evaluate the current performance of your application and identify areas that need improvement</li><li>Invest in an application performance management (APM) platform to administer the maintenance of your SLA</li></ul></div></span>",

In this article, professor and Comcast engineer Tom Barker explains how poor application performance can hinder your company’s digital transformation.</p><p>Customers quick to abandon slow-loading applications can be left with the impression that your site’s problems are indicative of other offerings. You’ll learn tips for addressing web performance on a large scale, including the recruitment of internal and external champions to help you set up processes and best practices for improving and maintaining your application’s day-to-day performance.</p></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><span><span><span><p><b>Transform your organization into a dynamic catalyst for success</b></p><p><i>Accelerating Performance</i> is not just another “warm and fuzzy” change management book—it's a practical, comprehensive, data-driven action plan for picking up the pace and achieving <i>more</i>. Co-written by one of the authors of <i>Beyond Performance</i>, this book draws on a combination of empirical research and decades of experience advising global companies to show you how to reduce time to value by building and changing momentum more quickly than your competitors.</p><p>The META framework (short for Mobilize, Execute, and Transform with Agility) offers advice for leading change at four levels: strategy, the organization, teams, and individuals. In addition to step-by-step guidance toward assessment, planning, and implementation, the book offers:</p><ul><li>A diagnostic tool for leaders, teams, and organizations to assess their starting place, and highlight the specific areas needed to improve the ability to accelerate performance.</li><li>A detailed look at the factors proven to create drag—and drive—at each of the four levels: strategy, organizations, teams, and individuals.</li><li>An exploration of the 39 differentiating actions that organizations can combine as dictated by their strategy and context into a winning recipe.</li><li>A closer look at the practices of 23 “superaccelerators,” a global (and perhaps unexpected) mix of companies that have demonstrated a consistent ability to accelerate performance.</li></ul><p>A single taste of success is all it takes to spark change, but the hard work of following through requires constant vigilance—and a plan. Learn how to capture that drive, bottle it, and use it to sustain motivation, inspiration, and achievement. Deliver at the highest level, and then turn around and do even better next time. <i>Accelerating Performance</i> gives leaders a step-by-step framework for taking action and transforming their organizations, teams, and even themselves—starting today.</p></span></span></span></span></span></span>",

Some management writers are even proposing in doing away with it. We agree that the current method of appraisal is unsustainable and counterproductive. In this book, we discuss Performance LeadershipTM – the idea of leading employee performance, which should be the focus of management. Just doing appraisal or evaluation is not enough. Managers must incorporate the entire model of performance management and use it to lead within their workgroup, department, or organization. We walk managers through the steps of Performance Leadership, discussing the benefits and pitfalls of each step. The idea of making performance management work as a leadership style is new and simple, but it takes dedication to complete the task. This book is valuable for supervisors, managers, human resource staff, and others – anyone who needs to manage performance!</p></span>",

In other words, we focus on after-the-fact occurrences <em>(appraisal activities)</em> instead of trying to eliminate these occurrences <em>(preventing activities).</em> Discussing and evaluating the core requirements of quality efficiency and improvement, <strong>10 Essentials for High Performance Quality in the 21st Century</strong> proposes an approach to help shift the paradigm of quality from appraisal mode to preventing mode.<br/><br/>Identifying 10 steps readers can follow to optimize the quality of products and improve customer satisfaction, the book explains the rationale behind each of the steps in separate chapters. It addresses specific quality issues in six different sectors of the economy and provides statistics, tables, and figures from various organizations that support the need for a paradigm shift.<br/><br/>Outlining a systematic process to guide your organization along the path toward improvement, the book covers risk and quality, multicultural management, empowerment, error analysis, team building, advanced quality planning, and quality operating systems. The accompanying downloadable resources provide tips and tools to help you implement all the necessary improvement initiatives under the umbrella of quality.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Around the world, hundreds of thousands of supervisors and leaders provide coaching, supervision and leadership to staff every day of the year, yet the majority of supervisors have never attended formal training about how to be an effective supervisor and leader. The majority of supervisors do not refresh their skills, knowledge and capabilities to remain up to date or evaluate their supervisory practice regularly.</p><p>Supervision is fundamental to ensure that employees meet the requirements of their role, feel supported and valued, and engage in ongoing growth and development. When supervision is effective, it reduces stress, fatigue and burnout. Supervision ensures that employees reflect on their work to maintain high performance and it supports well-being as a professional.</p><p>This latest book is an essential guide for experienced supervisors and leaders. It is a comprehensive book demonstrating how to provide effective supervision and leadership in the modern workplace. It assists leaders to understand the industrial and ethical context in which supervision is provided, how to evaluate the effectiveness of supervision, and shows supervisors and leaders the specific capabilities that are necessary to be a quality leader and supervisor. </p><p>This book is a must-read for any supervisor or leader who wants to provide effective supervision and leadership. Each chapter provides valuable information and the latest research on supervision with reflective questions to guide supervisors in their thinking and learning about supervision.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p><b>Five practical steps to enhance organization effectiveness on a global scale</b></p><p><em>Bridging Organization Design and Performance</em> is a handbook for leaders looking to enhance the success of their organizations and themselves. Companies that compete globally require organizational operating models as robust as their strategies. Many companies have created elegant designs and consider their worldwide, matrix organizations sources of competitive advantage. However, the reality is that these complex structures bring many challenges and senior executives are often frustrated by the difficulties of delivering growth in organizations that span numerous brands, products, and geographic regions.</p><p>After working closely with over twenty large US and Europe based global companies during the past decade, Gregory Kesler and Amy Kates concluded that the problem is not in the fundamental design of these operating models. The matrix is not going away. The challenge is to effectively and completely activate the organization to deliver the strategy. This book shares the five practical actions that bring complex organizations to life and help companies gain sustainable results from their global operating models.</p></span></span></span>",

Pink, author of <i>To Sell Is Human</i> and <i>Drive</i></b></p><p>\"Social technologies aren't just changing how people interact, they're fundamentally changing how businesses must engage with people inside and outside their organization. In <i>The Crowdsourced Performance Review</i>, Mosley shows HR and business leaders why a 'groundswell' approach for employee recognition is the key to driving better employee performance. This is one of the most innovative enterprise uses of crowdsourcing I've seen.\"<br/><b>--Charlene Li, founder of Altimeter Group, author of <i>Open Leadership</i>, and coauthor of <i>Groundswell</i></b></p><p>\"In what is easily the most comprehensive and provocative Globoforce book to date, Mosley lays out a clear vision for how modern recognition systems can be integrated with performance management.

Instead of a one-time annual evaluation of performance, managers and employees receive collective feedback from everyone across their company. It's all achieved through crowdsourcing, and it generates more accurate, actionable results than traditional methods.</p><p>With <i>The Crowdsourced Performance Review</i>, you'll create a review system that gathers the feedback of many, so you can make better, more informed decisions. And this new model is simpler than you think. It's based on three innovations:</p><p><b>CROWDSOURCING:</b> Applying the same techniques that companies like Apple, Angie's List, and Zagat use to inform customers, you can gather the same kind of data to inform managers.</p><p><b>SOCIAL MEDIA TECHNOLOGIES:</b> The most revolutionary communication tools since the telephone, these technologies have singlehandedly created a new language of business.</p><p><b>ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE:</b> When managed well, it's one of the most effective tools for building and maintaining a competitive advantage.</p><p>These three assets come together for the purpose of evaluating performance in the practice of social recognition--a system in which all employees recognize each other's great work on a daily basis. Social recognition creates engagement, energy, and even happiness in a company--leading to the ultimate goal of a Positivity-Dominated Workplace.</p></span></span>",

    "title": "Becoming the Supervisor",
    "description": "<span><p><strong>Becoming a Supervisor</strong> tells the story of Trevor who works as one of the production team in a small company that makes toy boats. He is thrust into the role of supervisor unexpectedly when his general manager reacts to his constant suggestions of how things could be better. When the GM becomes ill, Trevor struggles to take up the slack for several months until a new GM arrives. The core of the book follows Trevor’s growth under the coaching of  Julie, his new GM. As Trevor deals with one challenge after another, Julie guides him on a journey to learn the core skills needed by all front-line leaders.</p><p>The reader takes away four key ideas: (1) Front-line leadership skills are not too complicated to learn. (2) These skills are something that they can develop in themselves, regardless of what their organization does. (3) Tools and skills are there to help solve real business problems; implementing the tools is not a strategy. (4) In your role as supervisor (directing or responsible for others) you have to look after the mission of the company AND look after your people – doing only one is not an option.</p><p>Essentially, this book is intended to give hope to a new supervisor or team lead. They will finish the book knowing that the skills they need can be learned and aren’t that difficult to acquire. It is designed to introduce the central skills that any supervisor has to be able to master at least with a basic working competency: instructing, leading, and making improvements in their own area. It introduces some of the more widely used tools that a new supervisor may need. More importantly, it ties these tools and skills to solving particular problems. Readers will understand that the tools are not important for their own sake, but only to the extent that the tools serve the larger objective of the organization. </p><p>This book is designed to give the reader an entertaining and hopeful story about the very difficult transition from worker to supervisor, from being one of the crew to directing the crew. It is an emotionally tough transition, and the idea that someone could see a model of how it can work out will be helpful to folks new in a leadership role. Finally, the book provides a reference to other sources of information that will let the reader extend their learning about each of the tools or skills referenced in the contents.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p><b>A clearer, more accurate performance management strategy</b></p><p>Over the past two decades, performance measurement has profoundly changed societies, organizations and the way we live and work. We can now access incredible quantities of data, display, review and report complex information in real time, and monitor employees and processes in detail. But have all these investments in collecting, analysing and reporting data helped companies, governments and people perform better?</p><p><em>Measurement Madness</em> is an engaging read, full of anecdotes so peculiar you'll hardly believe them. Each one highlights a performance measurement initiative that went wrong, explains why and - most importantly - shows you how to avoid making the same mistake yourself.</p><p>The dangers of poorly designed performance measurement are numerous, and even the best how-to guides don't explain how to avoid them. <em>Measurement Madness</em> fills in the gap, showing how to ensure you're measuring the right things, rewarding the behaviours that deserve rewarding, and interpreting results in a way that will improve things rather than complicate them. This book will help you to recognize, correct and even avoid common performance measurement problems, including:</p><li><p>Measuring for the sake of measuring</p></li><li><p>Assuming that measurement is an instant fix for performance issues</p></li><li><p>Comparing sets of data that have nothing in common and hoping to learn something</p></li><li><p>Using targets and rewards to promote certain behaviours, and achieving exactly the opposite ones.</p></li><p>Reading <em>Measurement Madness</em> will enable you to design a simple, effective performance measurement system, which will have the intended result of creating value in your organization.</p></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>For many years, there has been quite a bit of talk about employee engagement as a means to lift corporate profits and reduce absenteeism and turnover. However, this talk has not produced better companies. In fact, the evidence shows that incivility and instances of employee abuse are getting worse. Additionally, with profit as the primary goal of organizations, most employees view any benign treatment they receive as a secondary convenience that will dissipate once corporate fortunes decline. That is, many employees still believe they are expendable in the eyes of their employers.<br> <br>This book turns that equation around by examining the practices of twenty-one companies that put the interests and needs of employees first. The companies featured in this book see it as their mission to offer people a better, more fulfilling life for themselves, and assist with that holistic journey by providing the organizational elements people need to reach their potential. They do this first by creating respectful and kind cultures that treat every person as an equal, sentient partner in the success of the company. Second, they diligently work to satisfy people's basic needs. The result is a web of fellow-feeling: earnest affection among people who feverishly work to live up to both the high standards of the institution and their obligations to one another.</p></span>",

    "title": "Beyond the Bubble Test: How Performance Assessments Support 21st Century Learning",
    "description": "<span><span><span><p>Performance assessment is a hot topic in school systems, and educators continue to analyze its costs, benefits, and feasibility as a replacement for high-stakes testing. Until now, researchers and policymakers have had to dig to find out what we know and what we still have to learn about performance assessment. <em>Beyond the Bubble Test: How Performance Assessments Support 21st Century Learning</em> synthesizes the latest findings in the field, and not a moment too soon.</p><p>Statistics indicate that the United States is in danger of falling behind if it fails to adapt to our changing world. The memory and recall strategies of traditional testing are no longer adequate to equip our students with the skills they need to excel in the global economy. Instead teachers need to engage students in deeper learning, assessing their ability to use higher-order skills.</p><p>Skills like synthesizing information, understanding evidence, and critical problem-solving are not achieved when we teach to multiple-choice exams. Examples in <em>Beyond the Bubble Test</em> paint a useful picture of how schools can begin to supplement traditional tests with something that works better. This book provides new perspectives on current performance assessment research, plus an incisive look at what's possible at the local and state levels.</p><p>Linda Darling-Hammond, with a team of leading scholars, bring together lessons learned, new directions, and solid recommendations into a single, readily accessible compendium. <em>Beyond the Bubble Test</em> situates the current debate on performance assessment within the context of testing in the United States. This comprehensive resource also looks beyond our U.S. borders to Singapore, Hong Kong, and other places whose reform-mindedness can serve as an example to us.</p></span></span></span>",

Using this book’s\npowerful Work/Life Approach, you can build that organization.\nWorld-renowned performance consultants Dr. Gene Fusch and Richard\nGillespie offer a step-by-step blueprint for developing a true\nperformance culture, where people bring a relentless focus and\nselfless collaboration to bear on the organization’s most\nfundamental goals. <em>A Practical Approach to Performance\nInterventions and Analysis</em> walks through every step of the\nprocess: analyzing business problems, identifying performance gaps,\nselecting the best interventions, measuring results, and more.\nYou’ll learn how to integrate your organization’s goals\nwith the beliefs and needs of your people; foster unity without\nconformity, and diversity without division; how to overcome the\nfear and distrust that makes organizations dysfunctional; and how\nto build an organization where everyone really takes ownership of\ntheir “fraction of the action.” Along the way, they\npresent 50 dynamic models that tightly connect theory to real-world\nbusiness practice, are ROI-driven, are fully measurable, and can be\nutilized by all leaders and practitioners in HR, organizational\ndevelopment, and training. With their guidance, you can choose and\nexecute the performance initiatives that deliver the greatest\npositive impact on culture, business metrics, and the lives of all\nyour people.</p></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p>Proposing any performance or training solutions requires rigorous analysis based on data, not speculation. Conducting a front-end analysis—a process for determining why a perceived performance gap exists and how to close the gap—enables workplace learning and performance professionals to find successful solutions. This Infoline describes how to carry out the two distinct analysis processes that go into a front-end analysis: a gap (or performance) analysis and root cause analysis. The first process determines if a performance problem exists. The second process identifies the true root cause of the issue. Helpful sidebars explain the analysis sequence, when to conduct a gap analysis, how to define performance gaps without bias, and factors that influence performance. In addition, the job aid provides a checklist of questions for a training needs analysis.</p></span></span></span>",

    "title": "Computer Interpretation of Metaphoric Phrases",
    "description": "<span><p>The computational approach of this book is aimed at simulating the human ability to understand various kinds of phrases with a novel metaphoric component. That is, interpretations of metaphor as literal paraphrases are based on literal meanings of the metaphorically used words. This method distinguishes itself from statistical approaches, which in general do not account for novel usages, and from efforts directed at metaphor constrained to one type of phrase or to a single topic domain. </p><p>The more interesting and novel metaphors appear to be based on concepts generally represented as nouns, since such concepts can be understood from a variety of perspectives. The core of the process of interpreting nominal concepts is to represent them in such a way that readers or hearers can infer which aspect(s) of the nominal concept is likely to be intended to be applied to its interpretation. These aspects are defined in terms of verbal and adjectival predicates. A section on the representation and processing of part-sentence verbal metaphor will therefore also serve as preparation for the representation of salient aspects of metaphorically used nouns. </p><p>As the ability to process metaphorically used verbs and nouns facilitates the interpretation of more complex tropes, computational analysis of two other kinds of metaphorically based expressions are outlined: metaphoric compound nouns, such as \"idea factory\" and, together with the representation of inferences, modified metaphoric idioms, such as \"Put the cat back into the bag\". </p><p></p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><b>The <i>New York Times</i> Bestelling guide for managers and executives.</b></p><br/>Introducing the new, <i>realistic</i> loyalty pact between employer and employee.<br/><br/>The employer-employee relationship is broken, and managers face a seemingly impossible dilemma: the old model of guaranteed long-term employment no longer works in a business environment defined by continuous change, but neither does a system in which every employee acts like a free agent.<br/><br/>The solution? Stop thinking of employees as either family or as free agents. Think of them instead as <i>allies</i>.<br/><br/>As a manager you want your employees to help transform the company for the future. And your employees want the company to help transform their careers for the long term. But this win-win scenario will happen only if both sides trust each other enough to commit to mutual investment and mutual benefit. Sadly, trust in the business world is hovering at an all-time low.<br/><br/>We can rebuild that lost trust with straight talk that recognizes the realities of the modern economy. So, paradoxically, the alliance begins with managers acknowledging that great employees might leave the company, and with employees being honest about their own career aspirations.<br/><br/>By putting this new alliance at the heart of your talent management strategy, you’ll not only bring back trust, you’ll be able to recruit and retain the entrepreneurial individuals you need to adapt to a fast-changing world.<br/> <br/>These individuals, flexible, creative, and with a bias toward action, thrive when they’re on a specific tour of duty”when they have a mission that’s mutually beneficial to employee and company that can be completed in a realistic period of time.<br/><br/>Coauthored by the founder of LinkedIn, this bold but practical guide for managers and executives will give you the tools you need to recruit, manage, and retain the kind of employees who will make your company thrive in today’s world of constant innovation and fast-paced change.<br/>\n</span>",

    "title": "South Korean Democracy",
    "description": "<span><p>This new book offers a retrospective appraisal of the Gwangju Uprising by academics, activists and artists from Gwangju, Korea. </p><p>In 1980, South Koreans took to the streets to demand democracy. When the military threatened brutal suppression of the popular movement, only in Gwangju did people refuse to submit. After horrific bloodshed, the citizens of Gwangju drove the military out of the city and held their liberated space for a week. As a \"beautiful community\" emerged, newspapers were published, hundreds of thousands of people congregated in popular assemblies, and the city’s life gave new meaning to democracy. <br/> <br/>Although crushed by overwhelming military force, Gwangju’s example inspired the eventual overthrow of the military dictatorship and ushered in a new democratic wave in East Asia. Providing a detailed analysis of the events of the Gwangju uprising, this new volume traces the birth of South Korean democracy in Gwangju’s stubborn refusal to accept life without freedom. The book also focuses on the socio-economic background, the role of women in the uprising, issues of collective identity and the international significance of the revolt. <br/> <br/>Scholars and researchers of South Asian politics, social movements, history, democracy and development studies will find this volume to be of keen interest.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Teaching employees how to deliver effective performance appraisals will pay big dividends in your organization. But, too often, employees perceive the training as uninteresting – even boring. Here's a terrific resource full of hands-on exercises that will make training in this vital area enjoyable and extremely motivating. Every employee – regardless of how experienced they are in appraisals – will be stimulated by learning how to question, listen, be objective, give feedback, communicate and manage the process. Each activity is ready-to-use and includes a description, when to use it, objectives, materials and time required, and methods. Each activity takes under 60 minutes or so to complete. Need to find a specific activity quickly? No problem. The activities are categorized into two groups – the skills and the process – so they are easy to select. All handouts are numbered using the same number as the activity. And some you'll want to make into transparencies for use with an overhead projector. Whether you're a new or experienced trainer, you'll find all the support you need to lead the activities, adapt them to your own training style and give performance appraisal training the priority it deserves.</p></span>",

You'll also have access to extensive references and user-friendly charts and graphs all designed to help you develop, validate and enhance your practice. This title defines instructional technology and key terms; Notes the contributions of important theorists; Introduces approaches to evaluating the effectiveness of training programs; Describes the structure of instructional development processes; Clarifies the difference between behavior and performance; Gives an overview of Thomas Gilbert's theorems and behavior engineering model; Describes the process of front-end analysis; Summarizes the relationships between instructional technology and human performance technology.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>Dramatic increases in processing power have rapidly scaled on-chip aggregate bandwidths into the Tb/s range. This necessitates a corresponding increase in the amount of data communicated between chips, so as not to limit overall system performance. To meet the increasing demand for interchip communication bandwidth, researchers are investigating the use of high-speed optical interconnect architectures. Unlike their electrical counterparts, optical interconnects offer high bandwidth and negligible frequency-dependent loss, making possible per-channel data rates of more than 10 Gb/s. <strong>High-Speed Photonics Interconnects </strong>explores some of the groundbreaking technologies and applications that are based on photonics interconnects.</p><p><strong><em>From the Evolution of High-Speed I/O Circuits to the Latest in Photonics Interconnects Packaging and Lasers</em></strong></p><p>Featuring contributions by experts from academia and industry, the book brings together in one volume cutting-edge research on various aspects of high-speed photonics interconnects. Contributors delve into a wide range of technologies, from the evolution of high-speed input/output (I/O) circuits to recent trends in photonics interconnects packaging. The book discusses the challenges associated with scaling I/O data rates and current design techniques. It also describes the major high-speed components, channel properties, and performance metrics. The book exposes readers to a myriad of applications enabled by photonics interconnects technology.</p><p><strong><em>Learn about Optical Interconnect Technologies Suitable for High-Density Integration with CMOS Chips</em></strong></p><p>This richly illustrated work details how optical interchip communication links have the potential to fully leverage increased data rates provided through complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology scaling at suitable power-efficiency levels.

It explains what employee engagement is, why it matters, what the benefits of it are, what helps and hinders it, how to measure it, how to put theory into action when trying to create it. As an added benefit, it offers plenty of advice on how managers can keep themselves engaged, even during the toughest of times.</p><p>Praise for Engaged</p><p>\"The current economic crisis has underlined how traditional means of managing people are no longer effective. Too many businesses underperform because they can no longer count on the commitment of their workforce. Only by treating employees as key stakeholders and engaging them will organizations be successful. This timely book provides a practical roadmap for companies to create an engaged workforce and is essential reading for all business leaders.\"</p><p><em>Professor Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman, World Economic Forum</em></p><p>\"This is an important contribution to leaders and managers across all types of organizations. I believe readers of this book will be more confident and better equipped to address the issues their organizations are facing.\"</p><p><em>David MacLeod, Chairman of the UK Government-sponsored Employee Engagement Task Force and co-author of the influential report to the UK Government 'Engaging for Success'</em></p><p>\"This book highlights in a very understandable and comprehensive way, one of the most important HR concepts of our age, 'engagement'. During difficult times, we need more than ever to engage our workforce, to get them involved and committed. This book shows how to do it, and is a 'must read' for all line managers and HR professionals.\"</p><p><em>Cary L. Cooper, CBE, Distinguished Professor of Organizational Psychology and Health at Lancaster University Management School, UK</em></p><p>\"A must read, timely and practical primer on how to engage any workforce – warts and all.\"</p><p><em>Will Hutton, author of</em> Them and Us: Changing Britain – Why We Need a Fair Society, <em>Principal at Hertford College, Oxford, UK, Weekly Columnist at The Guardian and</em> The Observer Newspapers</p><p>\"An engaging book about engagement! Linda and Geoff have produced an authoritative book that makes the business case, the emotional case and developed an easy to understand model that will allow HR practitioners and line managers to accelerate implementation. Recognizing there is no 'one size fits all' approach, the book is full of practical case studies that will inspire and enthuse.\"</p><p><em>Dean Royles, Director, NHS Employers</em></p><p>\"The topic of employee engagement has caught the imagination of researchers and practitioners. But for many it is not clear what exactly it is, how you measure it and more importantly if, when and why it is related to productivity. In this well researched, easy to read, and eminently practical book Linda Holbeche and Geoff Matthews answer all the central questions about engagement. The book is topical, very up-to-date and highly practical.\"</p><p><em>Adrian Furnham, Professor of Psychology, University College London, writer on leadership and management topics and regular columnist for the Sunday Times</em></p><p>\"This book is a major contribution to helping managers take action to improve employee engagement in their business context. It's packed with ideas and advice for managers who want to foster commitment and energize their organizations. The authors' ideas around creating a new employment relationship built on engagement will have wide currency in the years ahead, and are as necessary as they are revolutionary for all business executives.\"</p><p><em>Mike Cullen, Ernst and Young Global Managing Partner – People</em></p></span></span>",

    "title": "Key Performance Indicators, 4th Edition",
    "description": "<span><p><b>The new edition of the bestselling guide on creating and using key performance indicators—offers significant new and revised content</b></p><p>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) help define and measure the organizational goals which are fundamental to an organization’s current and future success. Having solid KPIs is crucial for companies that are implementing performance management systems, such as balanced scorecards, six sigma, or activity-based management. In many organizations, KPIs are often too numerous, randomly assembled, and overly complex—essentially rendering them ineffectual, or at worse, counterproductive. <i>Key Performance Indicators</i> provides a model for simplifying the complex areas of KPIs while helping organizations avoid common mistakes and hazards.</p><p>Now in its fourth edition, this bestselling guide has been extensively revised and updated to incorporate practical lessons drawn from major implementations. Fresh content includes a more concise KPI methodology with clear implementation guidance, original insights on how other areas of performance management can be corrected, and new in-depth case studies. A revised starter kit is included to identify critical success factors, and the KPI resource kit contains updated worksheets, workshop programs, and questionnaires. Helping readers to better define and measure progress toward goals, this important guide:</p><ul><li>Dispels the myths of performance measurement and explains a simple, yet powerful KPI methodology</li><li>Explains the 12-step model for developing and using KPIs with guidelines</li><li>Helps readers brainstorm performance measures, sell KPI projects to the Board and senior management, and accurately report performance</li><li>Features the “KPI Project Leaders Corner” which provides readers with essential information and useful exercises</li><li>Includes an array of practical tools—templates, checklists, performance measures—and a companion website (www.davidparmenter.com)</li></ul><p><i>Key Performance Indicators: Developing, Implementing, and Using Winning KPIs, 4th Edition </i>is important resource for C-suite executives, senior management, project teams, external project facilitators, and team coordinators involved in all aspects of performance management systems.</p></span>",

All it takes is three simple 20-minute conversations.</p><p>Alan Vengel has spent 25 years helping Fortune 500 companies empower their employees to perform at peak efficiency, generating measurable results organization-wide. Now, in <em>20 Minutes to a Top Performer</em>, Vengel shares the secret to his and his clients’ success: good old-fashioned communication. Inside, he explains how to engage your employees through specific, focused conversations, of which there are exactly three:</p><p><b>Coaching:</b><br/>Focusing on performance and feedback</p><p><b>Motivating:</b><br/>Focusing on engagement and interests</p><p><b>Mentoring:<br/></b>Focusing on support and development</p><p>Vengel dissects these types of conversations to illuminate how, why, and when to initiate each one. The conversations are not meant to be technical. They won’t be uncomfortable or combative. They will simply be . . . conversations. And you’ll be surprised at how quickly you see results. Your people will become better team players, take greater enjoyment in their work, tackle problems with verve, and, in the end, contribute valuable talent to your organization for the long term.</p><p>Managers are facing unprecedented demands to do more with less—a trend that is clearly not going to reverse in the foreseeable future. You don’t need a Harvard Business School degree or expensive new technology to empower your workforce. All you need is the drive to make change happen.</p><p><em>20 Minutes to a Top Performer</em> is a blueprint to helping your people succeed. And when they succeed, you and the entire organization succeed.</p></div></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><div>It's the new normal.  Now all of your employees are Twittering away and friending clients on Facebook. Not to mention customers--who feel obligated to update your Wikipedia entry with product complaints.<br/><br/>In this new world, dealing with empowered employees and customers --Insurgents -- is only going to get more challenging. Employees are using this technology in the workplace and customers are using it in the marketplace, and neither obey the rules you set up.<br/><br/>This chaos is your future as a manager. You could try to shut it down and shut it off. Or you can harness it and reap the business benefits.<br/><br/>According to Josh Bernoff and Ted Schadler of Forrester Research (the organization that brought you Groundswell), your defense against insurgents is to enable them. At its heart, this is a book about how to scale the management of insurgency, both the innovation of insurgent employees and the energy of insurgent customers. The key is a process Forrester calls E Triple S, for the four elements of managing insurgents effectively: empowering, selecting, scaling, and socializing.<br/><br/>While it's based in current trends, the core concept of Managing Insurgents -- that the next management and innovation challenge is harnessing individuals empowered by mobile, social, and connected technology -- is a new idea. In the wake of Groundswell, dozens of social-technology-for-business books cropped up. And there are plenty of books on improving your customer service. But there's no serious business book about management, marketing, and innovation in the throes of this trend. When Insurgency hits, it will be perceived not just as a sequel to Groundswell but as the start of a new management philosophy.<br/></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>As long as there's been a Web, people have been trying to make it faster. The maturation of the Web has meant more users, more data, more features, and consequently longer waits on the Web. Improved performance has become a critical factor in determining the usability of the Web in general and of individual sites in particular.<i>Web Performance Tuning, 2nd Edition</i> is about getting the best possible performance from the Web. This book isn't just about tuning web server software; it's also about streamlining web content, getting optimal performance from a browser, tuning both client and server hardware, and maximizing the capacity of the network itself.<i>Web Performance Tuning</i> hits the ground running, giving concrete advice for quick results -- the \"blunt instruments\" for improving crippled performance right away. The book then shifts gears to give a conceptual background of the principles of computing performance. The latter half of the book examines each element of a web transaction -- from client to network to server -- to find the weak links in the chain and show how to strengthen them.In this second edition, the book has been significantly expanded to include:</p><ul><li type=\"disc\">New chapters on Web site architecture, security, reliability, and their impact on performance</li><li type=\"disc\">Detailed discussion of scalability of Java on multi-processor servers</li><li type=\"disc\">Perl scripts for writing web performance spiders that handle logins, cookies, SSL, and more</li><li type=\"disc\">Detailed instructions on how to use Perl DBI and the open source program gnuplot to generate performance graphs on the fly</li><li type=\"disc\">Coverage of rstat, a Unix-based open source utility for gathering performance statistics remotely</li></ul>In addition, the book includes many more examples and graphs of real-world performance problems and their solutions, and has been updated for Java 2.This book is for anyone who has waited too long for a web page to display, or watched the servers they manage slow to a crawl. It's about making the Web more usable for everyone.</div></span>",

But when your job presses you to betray your word, your principles, or other important commitments, it becomes profoundly unhealthy and deeply stressful. And it can happen even while working for an organization or leader you otherwise respect and admire.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Doty offers the antidote: redefining the game. When you feel pressured to play by rules that undermine your integrity, Doty shows how you can tap into six personal foundations that will allow you to stay true to your deepest values and aspirations. Through more than fifty vivid firsthand accounts of compromise and courage in business, she provides guidance for anyone at any organizational level who wants to act with greater clarity, strength, and purpose, as well as for senior leaders striving to lead organizations that allow people to remain true to themselves. The Compromise Trap details a strategy that enables you to remain a positive force—for yourself and whatever you define as the greater good—no matter how difficult the circumstances. <br/><br/>\n  </span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>This Wrox Blox demonstrates how standards compliance in Internet Explorer 8 will impact your Web sites. It will teach you how to immediately ensure visitors to your sites have a positive experience using IE 8, while also giving you time to test your site or make any necessary changes. The IE 8 browser will undoubtedly cause many current web sites to render or behave incorrectly, since so many web sites were either developed prior to modern web standards, or without consideration for standards. In addition, many Web developers used non-standard techniques in order to get their sites to work properly in older versions of browsers.</p><p>There are several new features in IE 8 designed to drive traffic to your Web site. Accelerators provide the ability to highlight content on a web page and perform an action on it. How often have you selected an address on a web page, copied it, and then pasted it into the proper fields of a mapping Web site? In IE 8 you can select the address and use a mapping accelerator to quickly display that address on a map. By creating your own accelerators, you can provide this feature to save users time and bring them to your site. Web slices are similar to RSS feeds, but let you subscribe to content directly within a web page. Your users can easily determine that new content exists, and it is easy for content creators to setup.</p><p>IE 8 compliance with CSS provides several improvements with support for pseudo classes, counters, and the selectors API. The pseudo classes \":before\" and \":after\" can be used to add content to web pages from within a stylesheet. CSS counters are perfect for content that needs to be numbered, without requiring the numbers to be embedded in the content. The selectors API utilizes CSS selectors in JavaScript to locate elements rather than traversing the DOM tree.</p><p>AJAX has been growing in popularity and is used on many web sites, but it also introduces some problems. Changes made on the client are not recognized, so the browser back and forward buttons don't work as expected. IE 8 provides a mechanism to use AJAX without losing the typical navigation experience. AJAX developers often want to utilize content from 3rd party web sites, but current browser implementations block this due to security concerns. IE 8 includes a new object and technique to enable these cross domain calls.</p><p>IE 8 will certainly impact web developers with its strict support for existing standards, which will cause many existing sites to render and behave incorrectly. It also provides many new features that can be used to simplify creation of web sites and increase productivity.</p></span></span>",

Now in its third edition, this bestselling guide provides a model for simplifying KPIs and avoiding the pitfalls ready to trap the unprepared organization. New information includes guidance toward defining critical success factors, project leader essentials, new tools including worksheets and questionnaires, and real-world case studies that illustrate the practical application of the strategies presented. The book includes a variety of templates, checklists, and performance measures to help streamline processes.</p>\n\n<p>Key Performance Indicators are a set of measures that focus on the factors most critical to an organization's success. Most companies have too many, rendering the strategy ineffective due to overwhelming complexity. Key Performance Indicators guides listeners toward simplification, paring down to the most fundamental issues to better define and measure progress toward goals. Readers will learn to:</p>\n\n<p>- Separate out performance measures between those that can be tied to a team and result in a follow-up phone call (performance measures) and those that are a summation of a number of teams working together (result indicators)</p>\n\n<p>- Look for and eradicate those measures that have a damaging unintended consequence, a major darkside</p>\n\n<p>- Sell a KPI project to the Board, the CEO, and the senior management team using best practice leading change techniques</p>\n\n<p>- Develop and use KPIs effectively with a simple five stage  model</p>\n\n<p>- Ascertain essential performance measures, and develop a reporting strategy</p>\n\n<p>- Learn the things that a KPI project leader needs to know</p>\n\n<p>A KPI project is a chance at a legacy-the project leader, facilitator, or coordinator savvy enough to craft a winning strategy can affect the organization for years to come. KPI projects entail some risk, but this book works to minimize that risk by arming stakeholders with the tools and information they need up front. Key Performance Indicators helps leaders shape a performance measurement initiative that works.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>\nFor as long as there's been a Web, people have been trying to make\nit faster. The maturation of the Web has meant more users, more\ndata, more bells and whistles, and consequently longer waits on the\nWeb. Improved performance has become one of the most important\nfactors in determining the usability of both the Web in general and\nof individual sites in particular. <em>Web Performance Tuning</em> is\nabout getting the best performance from the Web. This book isn't\njust about tuning the web server software; it's also about getting\noptimal performance from a browser, tuning the hardware (on both\nthe server and browser ends), and maximizing the capacity of the\nnetwork itself. <em>Web Performance Tuning</em> hits the ground\nrunning, giving concrete advice for quick results--the \"blunt\ninstruments\" for improving crippled performance right away. The\nbook then takes a breath and pulls back to give a conceptual\nbackground of the principles of computing performance. The latter\nhalf of the book approaches each element of a web transaction--from\nclient to network to server--to examine the weak links in the chain\nand how to strengthen them. Tips include:\n</p><ul><li><p>Using simultaneous downloads to locate bottlenecks</p></li><li><p>Adjusting TCP for better web performance</p></li><li><p>Reducing the impact of DNS</p></li><li><p>Upgrading device drivers</p></li><li><p>Using alternatives to CGI</p></li><li><p>Locating the web server strategically</p></li><li><p>Minimizing browser cache lookups</p></li><li><p>Avoiding symbolic links for web content</p></li></ul></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><div>Do you have an employee whose performance keeps deterioratingdespite your close monitoring? Brace yourself: You may be at faultby unknowingly triggering the set-up-to-fail syndrome. Perhaps things started off swimmingly. But then something--a missed deadline, a lost clientmade you question the person's performance. You began micromanaging him. Suspecting your reduced confidence, he started doubting himselfand stopped giving his best. You viewed his new behavior as additional proof of mediocrity, and tightened the screws further. In <i>The Set-Up-to-Fail Syndrome</i>, Jean-Francois Manzoni and Jean-Louis Barsoux show how this insidious cycle hurts everyone: employees stop volunteering ideas, preventing your organization from getting the most from them; you lose energy to attend to other activities; and your reputation suffers as other employees deem you unfair. Team spirit wilts as targeted performers are alienated. But the set-up-to-fail syndrome doesn't have to happen. The authors provide preventive measures, such as loosening the reins as new employees master their jobs. If the syndrome has already erupted, Manzoni and Barsoux explain how to discuss the dynamic with your employee and reverse the cycle.<br/></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><i>Libraries and Key Performance Indicators: A Framework for Practitioners</i> explores ways by which libraries across all sectors can demonstrate their value and impact to stakeholders through quality assurance and performance measurement platforms, including library assessment, evaluation methodologies, surveys, and annual reporting. Whilst several different performance measurement tools are considered, the book’s main focus is on one tool in particular: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). KPIs are increasingly being used to measure the performance of library and information services, however, linking KPIs to quality outcomes, such as impact and value can prove very difficult. This book discusses, in detail, the concept of KPIs in the broader context of library assessment and performance measurement. Through reviewing some of the applied theory around using KPIs, along with harvesting examples of current best practices in KPI usage from a variety of different libraries, the book demystifies library KPIs, providing a toolkit for any library to be used in setting meaningful KPIs against targets, charters, service standards, and quality outcomes.</p><ul><li>Provides an overview of performance measurement tools for libraries</li><li>Discusses KPIs in a broad context</li><li>Offers an understanding of reporting, monitoring, and acting upon KPI data</li><li>Provides best practice examples of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in libraries</li><li>Includes practical and reusable examples of KPIs that can be applied in local contexts (a toolkit approach)</li></ul></span>",

What good is an intricate Web infrastructure if you're unable to measure its effectiveness?  That's why every business is desperate for feedback on their site's visitors:  Who are they? Why do they visit? What information or service is most valuable to them?</p><p>Unfortunately, most common Web analytics software applications are long on functionality and short on documentation.  Without clear guidance on how these applications should be integrated into the greater Web strategy, these often expensive investments go underused and underappreciated.</p><p>Enter <i>Web Site Measurement Hacks</i>, a guidebook that helps you understand your Web site visitors and how they contribute to your business's success.  It helps organizations and individual operators alike make the most of their Web investment by providing tools, techniques, and strategies for measuring--and then improving--their site's usability, performance, and design.  Among the many topics covered, you'll learn:</p><ul><li>definitions of commonly used terms, such as \"key performance indicators\" (KPIs)</li><li>how to drive potential customers to action</li><li>how to gather crucial marketing and customer data</li><li>which features are useful and which are superfluous</li><li>advanced techniques that senior Web site analysts use on a daily basis</li></ul>By examining how real-world companies use analytics to their success, <i>Web Site Measurement Hacks</i> demonstrates how you, too, can accurately measure your Web site's overall effectiveness.  Just as importantly, it bridges the gulf between the technical teams charged with maintaining your Web's infrastructure and the business teams charged with making management decisions.<p>It's the technology companion that every site administrator needs. </p></div></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>In today's highly connected world, almost everybody has a web site, from local sewing circles to the world's largest corporations. If you're ready for one of your own, Microsoft's FrontPage 2003 has everything you need to create Web pages. It's true. Your geek friends may howl in contempt if you use FrontPage, but that's because the program has a reputation for spitting out cookie-cutter Web pages with messy, overloaded HTML code that takes forever to load. Not any more.</p><p>After listening to complaints, Microsoft has given FrontPage 2003 some pretty advanced features, including an HTML cleanup tool that helps alleviate bloated code, and new support for Macromedia Flash and XML. Now, savvy Web veterans can control as much of the process as they want, and even collaborate on a site with developers who use Dreamweaver, GoLive or other Web authoring tools. Yet, unlike those other tools, FrontPage 2003 still has automated features for beginners who don't know where to start. </p><p>There's still one flaw, though. Microsoft's idea of a user manual is a flimsy pamphlet. But that's easily solved. <i>FrontPage 2003: The Missing Manual</i> offers you everything from the basics to meaty sections on advanced tasks. Our book puts the program's features in context, with clear and thorough chapters that provide valuable shortcuts, workarounds, and just plain common sense, no matter where you weigh in on the technical scale. With it, you can learn to build simple Web pages, or sophisticated ones with tables and Cascading Style Sheets, and find out how to manage and publish a Web site. You'll also learn to create forms, work with databases, and integrate FrontPage with Microsoft Office.</p><p>If you haven't worked with Web pages before, each chapter provides \"Up to Speed\" sidebars with useful background information. If you do have experience, the \"Power Users' Clinic\" sidebars offer advanced tips and insights. You won't find tips like those in the pamphlet, or even in the Help file. <i>FrontPage: The Missing Manual</i> gives you the complete lowdown on the program above and beyond any book on the market.</p></div></span></span>",

    "description": "<span>\n    In today's fast-paced business environment, frequent feedback and “course correction” is absolutely vital. But about the only time most managers offer employees feedback is during scheduled (and generally infrequent) performance appraisals, which tend to be stiff, formal, and—whether intentionally or not—adversarial, and therefore ineffective. Formula 2+2 offers a simple yet powerful approach to revolutionizing feedback conversations. It details the five secrets of effective feedback:<br/><br/>Timeliness<br/>Balance<br/>Focus<br/>Specificity<br/>Follow-up<br/><br/>Formula 2+2 shows how to foster a culture of continuous feedback which increases the effectiveness of the manager, protects the spirit and dignity of employees, and provides a systematic approach to reinforcing and improving employee performance.<br/>\n  </span>",

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>Apache is far and away the most widely used web server platform in the world. Both free and rock-solid, it runs more than half of the world's web sites, ranging from huge e-commerce operations to corporate intranets and smaller hobby sites, and it continues to maintain its popularity, drawing new users all the time. If you work with Apache on a regular basis, you have plenty of documentation on installing and configuring your server, but where do you go for help with the day-to-day stuff, like adding common modules or fine-tuning your activity logging?The <i>Apache Cookbook</i> is a collection of problems, solutions, and practical examples for webmasters, web administrators, programmers, and everyone else who works with Apache.  For every problem addressed in the book, there's a worked-out solution or \"recipe\"--short, focused pieces of code that you can use immediately. But this book offers more than cut-and-paste code. You also get explanations of how and why the code works, so you can adapt the problem-solving techniques to similar situations.The recipes in the <i>Apache Cookbook</i> range from simple tasks, such installing the server on Red Hat Linux or Windows, to more complex tasks, such as setting up name-based virtual hosts or securing and managing your proxy server. The two hundred plus recipes in the book cover additional topics such as:</p><ul><li>Security</li><li>Aliases, Redirecting, and Rewriting</li><li>CGI Scripts, the suexec Wrapper, and other dynamic content techniques</li><li>Error Handling</li><li>SSL</li><li>Performance</li></ul>The impressive collection of useful code in this book is a guaranteed timesaver for all Apache users, from novices to advanced practitioners. Instead of poking around mailing lists, online documentation, and other sources, you can rely on the <i>Apache Cookbook</i> for quick solutions to common problems, and then you can spend your time and energy where it matters most.</div></span></span>",

Nonetheless, contractors' livelihoods depend on how the government collects and uses their past performance information.<br/>Winning with Past Performance: Strategies for Industry and Government aims to enhance awareness and understanding of past performance processes as well as to promote smart business practices on both the buyer and seller sides of the equation. The authors examine all aspects of past performance, including using feedback to improve performance, the government's evolving use of past performance, and the future of past performance as an evaluation tool.<br/>Winning with Past Performance brings it all together on the subject of past performance and is a ready reference for buyers, sellers, policymakers, contracting professionals, and service providers.<br/>\n  </span>",

Slash implements the\nkind of web site that has come to be called a \"weblog\": a moderated\nlist, in reverse chronological order, of timely items with links to\nfurther discussion on-site, or to further information off-site.\nEssentially, a weblog is a cooperatively authored daily newspaper\nfor some defined community on the net.\n</p><p>Slash has spawned several imitators. The existence of so many\ndifferent systems for operating a weblog site demonstrates that\nthere are many people and groups on the net who want to run their\nown online community newspapers. Slash is based on open source\ntechnologies (Perl, Apache, and MySQL), and it makes use of open\nprotocols (XML and RDF) for exchanging headlines with other\nsites.</p><p>Anyone who wants to get a weblog site up and running will want\nto read this book, particularly system administrators who may not\nhave the time or the background to learn all about Slash by reading\nthe source code. Content managers of Slash sites who want to be\nable to use the system more effectively will also benefit from this\nbook, which organizes the knowledge currently distributed\nthroughout the Slash source code, Slashcode web site, and mailing\nlists, and provides it in an organized package.</p></span></span></span>",

Since the Rio Summit of 1992, the concept of sustainability has captured our imaginations and aspirations and efforts to develop its indicators have increased. A range of sustainability indicators have been developed within various socio-economic, environmental and cultural contexts- including biodiversity, economy, energy, water, land use and transport. Sustainability indicators are widespread in international development arena. They have become popularized among governments, non-governmental organizations, private sector and the wider public. </p><p>Based on multiple cases across the world, this book explores opportunities and challenges associated with the practical application of sustainability indicators. The book reflects diversity of professionals of inter-disciplinary backgrounds covering contemporary issues within different socio-economic and environmental contexts. Each chapter presents practical examples of the merits and challenges of using sustainability indicators and draws conclusions and lessons learned. The book targets a range of audience from students, academics to development practitioners and policy-makers. </p><p>The two editors of this book: Dr. Agnieszka Ewa Latawiec and Dr. Dorice Agol are inter-disciplinary scientists who both have experience in research at the environmental conservation and development nexus. </p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p>For years, investors, business strategists,\nand policymakers worldwide have turned to one book to help them\ntranslate the massive flow of economic data into knowledge for\nintelligent decision-making. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> called\nthis book \"…the real deal,\" saying it \"miraculously breathes\nlife into economic indicators and statistics.\" That book is Bernie\nBaumohl’s classic best-seller <em>The Secrets of Economic\nIndicators</em>. Now, in a brand-new Third Edition, Baumohl has\nthoroughly updated his classic to reflect the latest US and foreign\neconomic indicators, and brand-new insights into what all of\ntoday’s leading indicators mean. Baumohl introduces dozens of\nnew, forward-looking economic markers, including those that monitor\nsmall business plans, freight traffic shifts, web searches, and\neven gambling. He also presents several real-time foreign\nindicators for anticipating swings in European and Asian economies.\nHe explains what’s happened to the global and domestic U.S.\neconomy in recent years, showing how financial crises impact\ninvestments, strategy, and economic indicators. New graphics more\nclearly illuminate how key indicators impact interest rates, bond\nand stock prices, and currency values; and hundreds of websites\ncontaining US and global economic indicators have been updated.\nThis classic book has long been considered an invaluable resource\nby professionals who need to understand the true meaning of the\nlatest economic trends. With this new edition, Bernie Baumohl has\nmade it even more useful.</p></span></span></span>",

The outcome of the crisis may be unknown for years and a judgement on the project's success or failure may be out of reach for decades.</p><p>In the meantime, analysts, portfolio managers and traders will still have daily, weekly, quarterly and annual benchmarks. They will have to analyze economic developments in the euro area and their impacts on financial assets. The objective of this book is to provide a framework for that analysis that is comprehensible to most financial market participants.</p><p>The book begins with a focus on coincident and leading economic indicators for the euro area. The following section looks at euro-area institutions. The next chapter focuses on the euro crisis. It attempts to provide an explanation of its origins and a glimpse of the potential outcomes. In addition, the tools needed to analyze the crisis as it evolves are presented.  The last sections provide information unique to the economies of Germany, France, the U.K., Switzerland, Sweden and Norway.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Executives and managers hear or read headlines about recent economic data nearly every business day. Most important economic statistics are the products of programs designed to collect and analyze data to report summary results at regular intervals. Properly interpreted, these economic indicators provide useful barometers for different aspects of the economy and identify trends that aid better planning decisions. Economic indicators are available at the national level, state level, and even the regional and municipal level. This text focuses on economic indicators for the overall U.S. economy, identifying major categories of economic indicators and describing the key indicators in each of the categories. The text will also provide guidance for interpreting indicators expressed in terms of an index (which reports values as percentage of a base period value) or in real dollar values (which remove the impact of inflation.) Most key economic indicators are reported promptly on the World Wide Web and provided as formatted time series that can be readily downloaded and analyzed. The text will include links to the sources for key economic indicators as well as websites that maintain calendars of upcoming announcements and consensus forecasts of the indicators shortly prior to a formal announcement. This book is a companion to two other Business Expert Press by the authors that address managerial economics and time series data/forecasting. Together these books will equip the manager and the student with a solid understanding of economic indicators and how to analyze them.</p></span>",

The book covers an overall methodology for managing and conducting performance testing.<div><br/></div><div>Performance testing has often been considered a black art. In many organizations, perhaps an individual or a small group of technical staff or contractors is given the task of “load testing” an extended system, network, or application.<p></p>\n<p>Performance testing is like any other form of testing. It follows a defined test process that is similar to other test types. It utilizes a disciplined approach to the definition of requirements and user stories, the creation of test conditions, test cases, and test procedures. It establishes measurable goals against which the success or failure of the testing can be judged. It also requires (and this cannot be stressed highly enough) a definition and recognition of performance test failures. </p><p>Readers will gain the knowledge with both content and practice questions to prepare them for the ISQTB Performance Testing exam.

The problem is knowing which methods are actually proven to work-and how you should act on them to get the best results.</p>\n\n<p>In 8 Steps to High Performance, talent expert and bestselling author Marc Effron cuts through the noise with his signature \"science-based simplicity\" approach to identify what matters most and show you how to optimally apply your time and effort to boost your performance. It turns out that higher performance comes from doing many things well-but some of those things are not in your power to change. Effron reveals the eight key factors you do control and practical steps for improving yourself on each one. You'll learn: how to set goals that create higher performance; which behaviors predict higher performance in different situations; how to quickly develop the most important capabilities; who to connect with and why; how to understand and adapt to your company's strategy; why you sometimes shouldn't be the \"genuine\" you; how to best manage your body to sustain your performance; and how to avoid management fads that distract you from high performance. Research-based and practical, this short, powerful book will help you and anyone on your team deliver outstanding results.</p></span>",

    "title": "Oracle Database Transactions and Locking Revealed: Building High Performance Through Concurrency",
    "description": "<span><div><div>Access much-needed information for building scalable, high-concurrency applications and deploying them against the Oracle Database. This new edition is updated to be current with Oracle Database 19. It includes a new chapter with troubleshooting recipes to help you quickly diagnose and resolve locking problems that are urgent and block production.</div><div><br/></div><div>Good transaction design is an important facet of highly-concurrent applications that are run by hundreds, even thousands, of users who are executing transactions at the same time. Transaction design, in turn, relies on a good understanding of how the database engine manages the locking of resources to prevent access conflicts and data loss that might otherwise result from concurrent access to data in the database. This book provides a solid and accurate explanation of how locking and concurrency are dealt with by Oracle Database. You will learn how the Oracle Database architecture accommodates user transactions, and how you can write code to mesh with the way in which Oracle Database is designed to operate.</div><div><br/></div><div><b><i>Oracle Database Transactions and Locking Revealed</i></b> covers in detail the various lock types, and also different locking schemes such as pessimistic and optimistic locking. Then you will learn about transaction isolation and multi-version concurrency, and how the various lock types support Oracle Database’s transactional features. You will learn tips for transaction design, as well as some bad practices and habits to avoid. Coverage is also given to redo and undo, and their role in concurrency. The book is loaded with insightful code examples that drive home each concept. This is an important book that anyone developing highly-concurrent applications will want to have handy on their shelf.</div></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><b>What You Will Learn</b></div><div><div><ul><li>Avoid application lockups due to conflicts over accessing the same resource</li><li>Understand how Oracle prevents one application from overwriting another’s modifications</li><li>Create transaction designs that mesh with how Oracle Database is designed</li><li>Build high-throughput applications supporting thousands of concurrent users</li><li>Design applications to take full advantage of Oracle’s powerful database engine</li><li>Gain a fundamental knowledge of Oracle’s transaction and locking architecture</li><li>Develop techniques to quickly diagnose and resolve common locking issues</li></ul></div></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b></div><div><br/></div>Oracle developers and database administrators faced with troubleshooting and solving deadlocks, locking contention, and similar problems that are encountered in high-concurrency environments; and application developers wanting to design their applications to excel at multi-user concurrency by taking full advantage of Oracle Database’s multi-versioning and concurrency support<br/></span>",

However, tuning these models for maximum performance remains something of a challenge for most modelers. This course will teach you how to get results as a machine learning practitioner.</p><p>The course starts with an introduction to the problem of overfitting and a tour of regularization techniques. Learn through better configured stochastic gradient descent batch size, loss functions, learning rates, and to avoid exploding gradients via gradient clipping. After that, you'll learn regularization techniques and reduce overfitting by updating the loss function using techniques such as weight regularization, weight constraints, and activation regularization. Post that, you'll effectively apply dropout, the addition of noise, and early stopping, and combine the predictions from multiple models.</p><p>You'll also look at ensemble learning techniques and diagnose poor model training and problems such as premature convergence and accelerate the model training process. Then, you'll combine the predictions from multiple models saved during a single training run with techniques such as horizontal ensembles and snapshot ensembles.</p><p>Finally, you'll diagnose high variance in a final model and improve the average predictive skill.</p><p>By the end of this course, you'll learn different techniques for getting better results with deep learning models.</p><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p>This course is for developers, machine learning engineers, and data scientists that want to enhance the performance of their deep learning models. This is an intermediate level to advanced level course. It's highly recommended that the learner be proficient in Python, Keras, and machine learning.</p><p>A solid foundation in machine learning, deep learning, and Python is required to get better results out of this course. You are also recommended to have the core machine learning libraries in Python.</p></span>",

At all levels, executives around the world are faced with complexities rising from disruptive business models, new technologies, socio-economic changes, shifting political circumstances, and an array of other sources. <i>High Performance Boards </i>is the comprehensive manual for attaining best-in-class governance, offering pragmatic guidance on improving board quality, accountability, and performance.</p><p>This authoritative volume identifies the four dimensions, or <i>pillars</i>, which are crucial for establishing and maintaining best-practice boards: the people involved, the information architecture, the structures and processes, and the group dynamics and culture of governance. This methodology can be applied to any board in the world, corporate or non-profit organization, regardless of size, sector, industry, or context. Readers are introduced to a fictitious senior board member – an amalgamation of board members from well-known organisations – and follow her as she successfully handles real-life challenges with effective governance. Drawn from the author’s 20 years of practice and confidential work with boards across the world, this book:</p><ul><li>Demonstrates how high-performance boards innovate and refine their practices</li><li>Discusses examples of board failures and challenges, including case studies from both for-profit and non-profit organisations including international organizations and state-owned agencies or even ministries</li><li>Provides a proven framework to create best-in-class governance</li><li>Includes a companion website featuring tools for board assessment and board practice</li></ul><p><i>High Performance Boards </i>has inspired more than 3000 board members around the world.

In this illuminating book from Eric Karpinski, managers and team leaders will learn the key to effectively engaging employees: focus on happiness. But not all types of happiness drive engagement; by selecting specific strategies that activate employees’ inherent motivation for <i>certain types</i> of happiness, you can simultaneously boost engagement and organizational performance. Everybody wins.</p><p>In <i>Put Happiness to Work</i>, Karpinski draws on his deep experience at the intersection of business and psychology to lay out a step-by-step program that includes specific activities to enhance engagement and generate happiness at work. Utilizing existing work habits and meetings, these dynamic yet simple tools will hardwire effective changes into leaders’ and employees’ behavior, creating long-term, sustainable engagement. Based on more than 10 years of experience applying top positive psychology and neuroscience research in the workplace, Karpinski’s strategies are easy to implement and are critical to helping leaders unlock the kind of engagement organizations need to thrive.</p><p><br/></p></span>",

    "description": "<span><b><i>Business Sustainability Factors of Performance, Risk, and Disclosure</i> examines sustainability factors of performance, risk and disclosure. The five dimensions of sustainability performance are economic, governance, social, ethical, and environmental (EGSEE).</b><p>Business sustainability is advancing from the greenwashing and branding to, very recently, business imperative as shareholders demand, regulators require, and companies report their sustainability performance. Sustainability has become economic and strategic imperative with potential to create opportunities and risks for businesses.</p><p><i>Business Sustainability Factors of Performance, Risk, and Disclosure</i> examines sustainability factors of performance, risk and disclosure. The five dimensions of sustainability performance are economic, governance, social, ethical, and environmental (EGSEE). Sustainability risks are reputational, strategic, operational, compliance, and financial (RSOCF). Sustainability disclosures are relevant to financial economic sustainability performance (ESP) and non-financial environmental, social, and governance (ESG) sustainability performance with ethics are integrated into all other components of sustainability performance.</p><p>This book offers guidance for proper measurement, recognition, and reporting of all five EGSEE dimensions of sustainability performance. It also highlights how people, business, and resources collaborate in a business sustainability and accountability model in creating shared value for all stakeholders. The three sustainability factors of performance, risk and disclosure are driven from the stakeholder primacy concept with the mission of profit-with-purpose. Anyone who is involved with business sustainability and corporate governance, the financial reporting process, investment decisions, legal and financial advising, and audit functions will benefit from this book.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><b>This book provides a step-by-step approach for organizations to reap benefits from a more sustainable approach.</b> As organizations tackle global challenges, the faces of our businesses and our economic system are changing to consider the interests of all stakeholders rather than just shareholders. This book provides a step-by-step approach for organizations to reap benefits from a more sustainable approach. It begins with a brief history of the concept of sustainability as it applies to both performance and reporting.  Implementing sustainability in an organization begins with the development of policies which are consistent with the expectations of its stakeholders.  An organization’s active participation in multi-stakeholder initiatives helps to align the policies with societal trends.  Once the policies are developed, a management system is crucial to ensure congruence of policies with actual performance. Then, periodic reporting of performance based on well-recognized standards aids stakeholders in assessing an organization’s performance–reporting also helps stakeholders to determine if performance aligns with their expectations.  Both internal and external assurances build stakeholder trust in the organization’s performance and reporting.  Finally, the book concludes with a reflection on key messages and potential future actions for continuous improvement.\n\n  </span>",

Environmental protection has been increasingly discussed by concerned citizen groups and politicians in the wake of unexpected environmental disasters that have occurred in recent years. The need to protect drinking water resources, control greenhouse gas emissions, and implement successful waste reduction practices will continue to gain visibility with growing social awareness. Environmental managers and leaders can all benefit from this comprehensive and strategic book which guides them through environmental regulatory requirements and methods that can be used to interpret the regulations, develop programs, and processes to ensure compliance. The book includes a Tool Kit containing resources that can assist a company in assessing and evaluating the strength of their environmental program, systems, and processes so that changes can be made before damages to the environment becomes a reality, and penalties are enforced.</p><p> </p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>There's a bewildering array of management tools out there. And they all promise to help you excel at the toughest parts of your job: defining your organization's strategic direction, managing customers and costs, and boosting workforce performance. But just 30 percent of these tools deliver as intended. Why? As Jeremy Hope and Steve Player reveal in Beyond Performance Management, while many tools are sound in theory, they're misused by most organizations. For example, executives buy and implement a tool without first asking, \"What problem are we trying to solve?\" And they use tools to command and control frontline teams, not empower them-a serious and costly mistake.</p>\n\n<p>In this eminently useful, clear-eyed book, the authors critically review dozens of well-known management tools-from mission statements, balanced scorecards, and rolling forecasts to key performance indicators, Six Sigma, and performance appraisals.

    "title": "Expert Performance Indexing in SQL Server 2019: Toward Faster Results and Lower Maintenance",
    "description": "<span><div>Take a deep dive into perhaps the single most important facet of good performance: indexes, and how to best use them. Recent updates to SQL Server have made it possible to create indexes in situations that in the past would have prevented their use.</div><div><br/></div><div>Other improvements covered in this book include new dynamic management views, the ability to pause and resume index maintenance, and the ability to more easily recover from failures during index creation and maintenance operations. This new edition also brings new content around the indexing of columnstore and in-memory tables, showing how these new types of tables and the queries that execute against them can also benefit from good indexing practices. </div><div><br/></div><div>The book begins with explanations of the types of indexes and how they are stored in databases. Moving deeper into the topic, and further into the book, you will look at the statistics that are accumulated both by indexes and on indexes. You will better understand what indexes are doing in the database and what can be done to mitigate and improve their effect on performance. You will get a look at the Index Advisor now available in Azure SQL Database, and learn how to review and maintain the health of your indexes. The final chapters present a guided tour through a number of scenarios showing approaches you can take to investigate, mitigate, and improve the performance of your database.</div><div><br/></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b>What You Will Learn</b></div><div><br/></div><div><div><ul><li>Properly index row store, columnstore, and in-memory tables</li><li>Review statistics to understand indexing choices made by the optimizer</li><li>Apply indexing strategies such as covering indexes, included columns, and index intersections</li><li>Recognize and remove unnecessary indexes</li><li>Design effective indexes for full-text, spatial, and XML data types</li><li>Manage the big picture: Encompass all indexes in a database, and all database instances on a server</li></ul></div></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b></div><div><br/></div><div>Database administrators and developers who are ready to lift the performance of their database environment by thoughtfully building indexes to speed up queries that matter the most and make a difference to the business<br/></div><div><br/></div></span>",
