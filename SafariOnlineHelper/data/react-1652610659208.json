Learn the theory, solve assignments, practice on demo projects and build one big application which is improved throughout the course: The Burger Builder! JavaScript is the major driver of modern web applications since it's the only programming language which runs in the browser and hence allows you to provide highly reactive apps. You'll be able to achieve mobile-app like user experiences in the web. But using JavaScript can be challenging - it quickly becomes overwhelming to create a nice web app with vanilla JavaScript and jQuery only. React to the rescue! React is all about components - basically custom HTML elements - with which you can quickly build amazing and powerful web apps. Just build a component once, configure it to your needs, dynamically pass data into it (or listen to your own events!) and re-use it as often as needed. Need to display a list of users in your app? It's as simple as creating a \"User\" component and outputting it as often as needed. By the end of the course, you will be able to build amazing React (single page) applications! A short refresher about the most important next-gen features is provided in the course.</p><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p>Students who want to learn how to build reactive and fast web apps. Anyone who's interested in learning an extremely popular technology used by leading tech companies like Netflix. Students who want to take their web development skills to the next level and learn a future-proof technology</p></span>",

You first learn how to create a modern React toolchain. Next, the training covers the advanced JavaScript concepts that regularly pop up in React and the modern ES6 features you’ll need to write more idiomatic React code. Next, the training covers a conceptual understanding of React and takes an in-depth look at how React’s virtual dom works. Starting in Lesson 6, you dive into writing React code using the original create class syntax and begin to look at the JSX. Next, you see how to rewrite your earlier code using modern ES6 features. From there, you learn the remaining vanilla React topics, such as component life cycle and state management. The training wraps up with a discussion of how you can tweak performance in React apps.</p><p><strong>About the Instructor</strong></p><p><strong>Charles Crawford III</strong> has more than ten years of software experience and five years of experience in software education.

    "description": "<span><span><p><strong>Nearly 6 Hours of Video Instruction</strong></p><p>React is an extremely popular tool for creating websites. It might help to think of it as sort of a halfway point between creating a site using a drag-and-drop editor, such as WordPress and Squarespace, and coding a site line by line by line, literally from scratch. Many companies find it an ideal compromise between these two options, providing the fine-grained control and customization of hand-coded sites with the ease and rapid development speed of drag-and-drop. It can be used in everything from the simplest blogs to the most grueling, tangled e-commerce sites.</p><p>This course provides you with a solid foundation in creating modern web applications using the latest version of React. You’ll start by learning basic React syntax and the architecture of a React web application, working your way through progressively more advanced concepts until you reach a deep level of understanding. By the end, you’ll not only have a firm grasp on what it takes to build a full-scale React application, but also the best practices to follow when doing so. This ensures that the end result of any further React-related endeavors will be not only an application that works, but one that is highly performant and maintainable.</p><p><strong>Description</strong></p><p>React allows developers to create beautiful, performant, easily maintainable websites incredibly quickly. React is currently the most popular JavaScript framework on the market and is used by a majority of companies. In fact, React currently has one of the largest gaps between the number of employers who want it and the number of developers who know it. In short, 33% of employers need React skills, but only 19% of developers said they know React.</p><p>In this LiveLessons, Shaun Wassell fills this need by providing a straightforward, comprehensive guide to learning React and all of its latest features. React is currently the most popular front-end JavaScript framework.</p><p>Access the companion code for this product at <a href=\"https://github.com/shaunwa/learn-react-livelessons\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/shaunwa/learn-react-livelessons</a>.\n \n</p><p>About the Instructor</p><p><strong>Shaun Wassell</strong>'s goal is to create a world where people are empowered to use programming as a way to solve meaningful problems—a world where writing code is just as natural for most people as walking or breathing. To help make this a reality, he has dedicated the past few years to helping people learn and master software-development skills through video courses, live training sessions, and one-on-one tutoring. Shaun has been programming since he was a kid, when creating video games was his gateway into the world of software. Since then, he’s been fortunate enough to be a contributing member on many amazing software projects and work with some incredible mentors along the way.</p><p><strong>Skill Level</strong></p><ul><li>Beginning to Intermediate</li></ul><p><strong>What You Will Learn</strong></p><ul><li>Code a full-scale React application</li><li>Build and deploy this application so that it can be accessed from anywhere</li><li>Communicate effectively with other React developers by knowing the fundamental concepts of React</li><li>Recognize good and bad patterns in React code</li></ul><p>Explore advanced features, such as:</p><ul><li>Using context to style websites dynamically</li><li>Using composition to increase code reuse and flexibility</li></ul><p><strong>Who Should Take This Course</strong></p><ul><li>Software developers, web developers, full-stack developers, front-end developers/engineers</li></ul><p><strong>Course Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Ideally, learners should know the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li><li>At the very least, they should have a strong grasp of basic programming concepts: variables, arrays, control-flow, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>About Pearson Video Training</strong></p><p>Pearson publishes expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

    "description": "<span><span><p><b>Summary</b></p><p><em>Functional and Reactive Domain Modeling</em> teaches you how\nto think of the domain model in terms of pure functions and how to\ncompose them to build larger abstractions.</p><p><b>About the Technology</b></p><p>Traditional distributed applications won’t cut it in the\nreactive world of microservices, fast data, and sensor networks. To\ncapture their dynamic relationships and dependencies, these systems\nrequire a different approach to domain modeling. A domain model\ncomposed of pure functions is a more natural way of representing a\nprocess in a reactive system, and it maps directly onto\ntechnologies and patterns like Akka, CQRS, and event sourcing.</p><p><b>About the Book</b></p><p><em>Functional and Reactive Domain Modeling</em> teaches you\nconsistent, repeatable techniques for building domain models in\nreactive systems. This book reviews the relevant concepts of FP and\nreactive architectures and then methodically introduces this new\napproach to domain modeling. As you read, you’ll learn where\nand how to apply it, even if your systems aren’t purely\nreactive or functional. An expert blend of theory and practice,\nthis book presents strong examples you’ll return to again and\nagain as you apply these principles to your own projects.</p><p><b>What’s Inside</b></p><li><p>Real-world libraries and frameworks</p></li><li><p>Establish meaningful reliability guarantees</p></li><li><p>Isolate domain logic from side effects&gt;</p></li><p><b>About the Reader</b></p><p>Readers should be comfortable with functional programming and\ntraditional domain modeling.

This course, designed for software architects and intermediate- to advanced-level Java programmers, teaches you how to apply the latest concurrency techniques to develop state of the art Java applications. With the rise of microservices and service oriented architectures (SOAs), asynchronous concurrency is now critical in day-to-day Java development. This course builds upon theory offered in the associated \"Asynchronous Programming in Java\" course by refactoring several Java projects using RxJava. It explains the concepts behind this popular library, shows how RxJava compares with other concurrency concepts, and illustrates how to use the library productively in practice.</p><ul><li>Understand how to program event-driven reactive code using the RxJava library</li><li>Learn to implement reactive code in a readable and maintainable way using RxJava</li><li>Gain experience building reliable and performant Java apps in a microservices/SOA model</li></ul><p>Richard Warburton is a software engineer, teacher, and Java Champion.

You'll discover a painless way to set up a React project and then you'll use React to build a working star rating UI component (i.e., the classic rating system where users rate things on a scale of one to x stars). Along the way, you'll see how React treats components as functions (functions that simply return UI elements); you'll learn how to create components and nest them inside other components (and why that's useful); you'll explore \"state\" (one of React's most import concepts) and how it relates to the way components display data that changes over time; and you'll finish up by learning how to manage complex state data with React's setState and array mapping tools.</p><ul><li>Learn everything you need to get started with React today</li><li>Discover the tool that lets you set up your React projects in a hassle-free manner</li><li>Explore and understand the underlying concepts that make React unique</li><li>Gain hands-on experience building React UI components</li></ul><p>Alex Banks and Eve Porcello are coauthors of <i>Learning React</i> (O'Reilly Media) and cofounders of Moon Highway, a curriculum development company based in Northern California.

Shaun Wassell offers a modern, full-fledged introduction to JavaScript. In particular, the viewer learns the modern syntax of JavaScript: ES6. Shaun delivers step-by-step guidance that takes the learner from the basic syntax and concepts of JavaScript, all the way through the more advanced concepts that are covered in technical interviews.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Learn React for Modern Web Applications LiveLessons</em> provides a solid foundation in creating modern web applications using the latest version of React. React enables developers to create beautiful, performant, easily maintainable websites incredibly quickly. React is currently the most popular JavaScript framework on the market and is used by a majority of companies, yet it has one of the largest gaps between the number of employers who want it and the number of developers who know it. In short, 33% of employers need React skills, but only 19% of developers say they know React.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Node.js Essentials LiveLessons</em> teaches you how to write performant back-end applications in JavaScript by leveraging the Node.js runtime. Several years ago, it wasn't possible to write JavaScript programs for the back end. JavaScript was strictly limited to running in a browser, and if a developer wanted to write back-end software, they had little choice but to learn another programming language, such as PHP. Now, that has all changed. Thanks to Node.js, which enables JavaScript to be run outside the browser, JavaScript developers can write web servers, server-side scripts, and any number of other useful back-end programs.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Full-Stack React LiveLessons</em> covers the fundamentals of full-stack development with the MERN (MongoDB Express, React, and Node.js) stack. For the full stack, developers need to make sure both the front and back end communicate well together. Toward that end, this video teaches you how everything works, what the key responsibilities of each component are, and how they flow together. Shaun addresses the key points for developers, with specific examples to demonstrate concepts.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>About Pearson Video Training</strong>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nPearson publishes expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

    "description": "<span><span><b>2.5 Hours of Video Training</b><br/><br/><b>Overview</b><br/><br/>\nIn <b>Test- Driven Development for React/Redux in an Isomorphic Application LiveLessons</b>, Hany Elemary, Lead Consultant at ThoughtWorks, explains a paradigm shift in the testability of front-end code made possible with React/Redux. The video introduces isomorphic applications and their unique benefits and challenges, and then jumps straight into the architecture of React/Redux applications from a testability perspective. Hany follows test-driven development (TDD) principles while building a real-world example--a search application--to demonstrate effective end-to-end testing. Popular testing tools for React/Redux applications, including Enzyme, SinonJS, Expect, Nock and Mountebank, are highlighted.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Description</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThe need for building highly performant and maintainable user interfaces is now greater than ever. React, a library designed and developed by Facebook, can solve many of the existing problems users face today--including poor browser performance while handling dynamic interactions with high loads of data. React also solves a lot of challenges for front-end developers. Due to its popularity, other supporting frameworks, such as Redux, came into the picture to make applications more predictable, testable, and easier to debug. However, they come with a different approach to front-end development and testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nTestability is key to maintaining the quality of any application while building confidence in the code as developers refactor their work. Writing proper tests can be a lengthy process, especially for newer frameworks such as React/Redux. <i>Test-Driven Development for React/Redux in an Isomorphic Application LiveLessons </i>quickly gets you up-to-speed on when to build isomorphic applications, how to effectively test your React and Redux code, and how to confidently refactor code while ensuring that business functionality is maintained.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Skill Level</b><br/>\n<ul><li>Intermediate</li></ul><br/>\n<b>Learning Objectives</b><br/>\n<ul><li>Learn the benefits and challenges of isomorphic applications li&gt;</li><li>Apply the testing pyramid in a React/Redux application</li><li>Think effectively about designing testable applications</li><li>Write end-to-end tests without the overhead of browser-driven tests</li></ul><br/>\n<b>Course Requirements </b><br/>\n<ul><li>A simple, yet powerful editor: Visual Studio Code or Atom </li><li>NodeJS</li></ul><br/>\n<b>Who Should Take This Course?</b><br/>\n<ul><li>Software developers and architects who are working on React (or React/Redux) applications</li></ul><br/>\n<b>Table of Contents<br/>\n<br/>\nIntroduction</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Lesson 1: Isomorphic Applications</b><br/>\n1.1 Isomorphic applications overview<br/>\n1.2 Benefits of isomorphic applications<br/>\n1.3 Challenges of isomorphic applications<br/>\n1.4 When to build isomorphic applications<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Lesson 2: React/Redux Overview </b><br/>\n2.1 Paradigm shift in front-end development<br/>\n2.2 Design motivation<br/>\n2.3 Design principles<br/>\n2.4 Uni-directional flow<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Lesson 3: TDD with React/Redux - Simple Components </b><br/>\n3.1 TDD overview<br/>\n3.2 Testing pyramid: unit tests, mock integrations, contract tests, and E2E tests<br/>\n3.3 Testing frameworks: Mocha, Mochawesome, Enzyme, Sinon, Istanbul<br/>\n3.4 Testing simple components: display logic and behavior<br/>\n3.5 Testing simple components: refactoring<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Lesson 4: TDD with React/Redux - Async Operations </b><br/>\n4.1 Async operations with Redux Sagas<br/>\n4.2 Testing frameworks: Nock, Mountebank<br/>\n4.3 Testing async operations with component integration<br/>\n4.4 Testing failure modes<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Summary</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Source code repository: </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/hanyelemary/tdd-react-redux-isomorphic\">GITHUB Download</a></p>\n<b>About LiveLessons Video Training</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThe LiveLessons Video Training series publishes hundreds of hands-on, expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

    "description": "<span><div><div><div>Assemble the complete stack required to build a modern web app using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node. This book also covers many other complementary tools: React Router, GraphQL, React-Bootstrap, Babel, and Webpack. This new edition will use the latest version of React (React 16) and the latest React Router (React Router 4), which has a significantly different approach to routing compared to React Router 2 which was used in the first edition of the book.</div><div><br/></div><div>Though the primary focus of Pro MERN Stack is to equip you with all that is required to build a full-fledged web application, a large portion of the book will be devoted to React 16. The popular MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node) stack introduced Single Page Apps (SPAs) and front-end Model-View-Controller (MVC) as new and efficient paradigms. </div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Facebook's React is a technology that competes indirectly with AngularJS. It is not a full-fledged MVC framework. It is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (in some sense the View part). Yet, it is possible to build a web app by replacing AngularJS with React – hence the term MERN stack</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><b>What You Will Learn</b></div><div><ul><li>Discover the features of React 16 to get the maximum out of this library<br/></li><li>Gain the basics of MongoDB, Express, and Node to build a web app<br/></li><li>Work with other libraries complementary to React, including React-Bootstrap, React Router, and GraphQL<br/></li><li>Use tools such as Babel and Webpack required to build JavaScript-based SPAs <br/></li><li>Tie all the components together to build a complete web app.<br/></li></ul></div><div><br/></div><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b></div><div><br/></div><div>Developers and architects who have prior experience in any web app stack other than the MERN stack will find the book useful to learn about this modern stack.

    "description": "<span><p><b>Work through engaging exercises and activities and gain practical skills to make your web applications function effortlessly with the help of React</b></p><h4>Key Features</h4><ul><li>Explore the React environment by creating live projects</li><li>Solve real-world problems relating to building modern web applications</li><li>Gain a thorough understanding of how data moves through different React components</li></ul><h4>Book Description</h4><p>Are you interested in how React takes command of the view layer for web and mobile apps and changes the data of large web applications without needing to reload the page?</p><p>This workshop will help you learn how and show you how to develop and enhance web apps using the features of the React framework with interesting examples and exercises.</p><p>The workshop starts by demonstrating how to create your first React project. You'll tap into React's popular feature JSX to develop templates and use DOM events to make your project interactive. Next, you'll focus on the lifecycle of the React component and understand how components are created, mounted, unmounted, and destroyed. Later, you'll create and customize components to understand the data flow in React and how props and state communicate between components. You'll also use Formik to create forms in React to explore the concept of controlled and uncontrolled components and even play with React Router to navigate between React components. The chapters that follow will help you build an interesting image-search app to fetch data from the outside world and populate the data to the React app. Finally, you'll understand what ref API is and how it is used to manipulate DOM in an imperative way.</p><p>By the end of this React book, you'll have the skills you need to set up and create web apps using React.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Use JSX to include logic in the view layer of applications</li><li>Get familiar with the important methods and events in the React lifecycle</li><li>Distinguish between class and functional component syntaxes</li><li>Create forms with Formik and handle errors</li><li>Understand the React Hooks API and the problems it can solve</li><li>Fetch outside data using the Axios library and populate the data to the app</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>The React Workshop is for web developers and programmers who are looking to learn React and use it for creating and enhancing web applications. Although the workshop is for beginners, prior knowledge of JavaScript programming and HTML and CSS is necessary to easily understand the concepts that are covered.</p></span>",

The course uses Java 8, although Spring Boot and most Spring projects support Java 6.</p><p><strong>Lesson Descriptions</strong></p><p>Lesson 1, “Basics,” examines what motivates the move to reactive programming and how it is supported in the Reactive Streams specification.</p><p>Lesson 2, “Data,” covers the importance of data and how Spring supports non-blocking data access for any NoSQL and SQL data stores.</p><p>Lesson 3, “HTTP Services,” focuses on what reactive programming means in an HTTP environment. It introduces functional reactive HTTP handlers, <a href=\"mailto:%60@RestController%60-style\">`@RestController`-style</a>controllers, reactive server-sent event streams and more.</p><p>Lesson 4, “WebSockets,” focuses on Websockets, a binary protocol that supports bi-directional communication. This lesson examines how websockets, which are an extension to HTTP, integrate with Reactive Streams.</p><p>Lesson 5, “HTTP Clients,” briefly reviews the `Webclient`, the reactive HTTP client. It also discusses some patterns that clients will care about when dealing with distributed services. After incrementally building up from basic reactive pipelines to data access and then HTTP and websockets, Lesson 6, “RSocket,” introduces RSocket. RSocket is a binary protocol that supports full duplex bi-directional communication, fully integrated in Spring Framework 5.2 and Spring Boot.</p><p>Lesson 7, “Security,” shows how Spring Security works flawlessly to protect HTTP and RSocket-based services.</p><p>Lesson 8, “Gateway,” examines how to use Spring Cloud Gateway and how it is used to act as an API gateway for HTTP- and RSocket-based services.</p><p>Lesson 9, “Reactive Streams Redux,” focuses on the Reactive Streams specification as a compatibility layer and shows how to use the Reactive Stream types as a mechanism for interoperability across opensource projects like Akka Streams, Vert.x. Spring Web Flux, and Spring Data.</p><p>The last lesson, Lesson 10 “Reactive Streams Redux,” briefly reviews testing reactive applications and covers Reactive data access, Reactive web services, and how to test reactive microservices.</p><p><strong>About Pearson Video Training</strong></p><p>Pearson publishes expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

    "title": "Programming Reactive Extensions and LINQ",
    "description": "<span><span><span><p><em>Pro Reactive Extensions and LINQ</em> is a deep dive into the next important technology for .NET developers: Reactive Extensions. This in-depth tutorial goes beyond what is available anywhere else to teach how to write WPF, Silverlight, and Windows Phone applications using the Reactive Extensions (Rx) to handle events and asynchronous method calls.</p><p>Reactive programming allows you to turn those aspects of your code that are currently imperative into something much more event-driven and flexible. For this reason, it's sometimes referred to as LINQ for Events.</p><p>Reactive programming hinges on the concept of the observable collection, as opposed to the simple enumerable collection with which we're all familiar. For example, to extract data from a collection and add it to a list box, you would traditionally iterate through the list box, extracting each object in turn. This approach works fine, but it requires significant knowledge about the data you're working with, which can be limiting. In Rx programming, you're instead informed about each object in turn and then free to react to each notification however you like, which affords much greater flexibility.</p><p>This book shows you how reactive programming can be applied to a range of situations—from WPF applications to Windows Phone apps—to improve coding efficiency and boost performance.</p></span></span></span>",

After briefly introducing Kotlin, it focuses on the functional Java 8 and later APIs that were introduced in Spring Framework 5 and also walks through a simple Kotlin example.</p><p>The second lesson covers Reactive Data Access using Spring Data and Spring Data MongoDB. It explores reactive streams types and shows how they lend themselves to the asynchronous, non-blocking style of data access.</p><p>After demonstrating how to build web applications that take advantage of the new reactive paradigm using Kotlin in Lesson 3, Lesson 4 focuses on the Reactive Streams specification as a compatibility layer and shows how to use the Reactive Stream types as a mechanism for interoperability across OS projects like Akka Streams, Vert.x. Spring Web Flux, and Spring Data Reactive MongoDB.</p><p>Lesson 5 briefly reviews testing reactive applications and covers how to mock out the scheduler that underpins all of your asynchronous reactive code, the step verifier, and testing reactive end points.</p><p>Lesson 6 focuses on Spring Integration and Spring Cloud Stream in a reactive world, specifically on how to consume data from a publisher in Spring Integration and how to consume data from a publisher in Spring Cloud Stream.</p><p>Lesson 7 covers Spring Cloud Function, a framework that supports adapters from AWS Lambda, Azure functions, and Google functions. It also explores Project Riff, a Kubernetes-based FaaS from Pivotal on which Spring Cloud Functions run natively.</p><p>Lesson 8 Looks at how to build edge services, specifically API adapters and API Gateways using Spring Cloud Gateway for use cases like session and path rewriting and filters. In addition, it covers how to build an API adapter using the reactive web client and functional reactive endpoints. It also covers circuit breakers and how those concerns play out in a reactive world.</p><p><strong>About the Instructor</strong><strong><br/></strong></p><p><strong>Josh Long</strong> (@starbuxman) is the Spring Developer Advocate at Pivotal.

    "description": "<span><div><p>Reactive programming is revolutionary. It makes asynchronous programming clean, intuitive, and robust. Use RxJS 5 to write complex programs in a simple way, and master the Observable: a powerful data type that substitutes callbacks and promises. Think about your programs as streams of data that change and adapt to produce what you want. Manage real-world concurrency and write complex flows of events in your applications with ease. Take advantage of Schedulers to make asynchronous testing easier. The code in this new edition is completely updated for RxJS 5 and ES6.</p><p>Create concurrent applications with ease using RxJS 5, a powerful event composition library. Real-world JavaScript applications require you to master asynchronous programming, and chances are that you'll spend more time coordinating asynchronous events than writing actual functionality. This book introduces concepts and tools that will greatly simplify the process of writing asynchronous programs.</p><p>Find out about Observables, a unifying data type that simplifies concurrent code and eases the pain of callbacks. Learn how Schedulers change the concept of time itself, making asynchronous testing sane again. Find real-world examples for the browser and Node.js along the way: how about a real-time earthquake visualization in 20 lines of code, or a frantic shoot-'em-up space videogame? You'll also use Cycle.js - a modern, reactive, web framework - to make a new breed of web applications.</p><p>By the end of the book, you'll know how to think in a reactive way, and to use RxJS 5 to build complex programs and create amazing reactive user interfaces. You'll also understand how to integrate it with your existing projects and use it with the frameworks you already know. All the code in this new edition has been thoroughly revised and updated for RxJS 5, ES6, and Cycle.js Unified.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p><br/><br/>NodeJS 6.x and a modern web browser</p></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><strong>13+ Hours of Video Instruction</strong><br/><br/><p>BuildFull-Stack Apps with MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js</p><br/><br/>\n\nIn this LiveLessons video, Shaun Wassell covers the fundamentals of full-stack development with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) stack. For the full stack, developers need to make sure both front- and backend communicate well together. Toward that end, this video teaches you how everything works, what the key responsibilities of each component are, and how they flow together. Shaun addresses the key points for developers, with specific examples to demonstrate concepts.<br/>\n<br/>\n\nLearn to use MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js (MERN) to create full-stack apps. MERN is currently the most popular stack for building full-stack web applications. It allows developers to quickly write entire applications‚Äîfrontend, backend, and database‚Äîusing only JavaScript.<br/>\n<br/>\n\nIn this 13+ hour LiveLessons video, Shaun Wassell covers the fundamentals of full-stack development with the MERN stack. You can learn by doing, as Shaun walks you through five example projects of increasing complexity that demonstrate the many different aspects of full-stack application development. How do you ensure your applications are secure? How do you handle authentication in full-stack apps? These are all questions Shaun answers in this timely and practical LiveLessons video. At the end of this video, you'll have five portfolio pieces that you can use for full-stack job interviews.<br/>\n<br/>\n\nAccess the supplemental resources for this LiveLesson at <a href=\"https://github.com/shaunwa/full-stack-react\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/shaunwa/full-stack-react</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>About the Instructor</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Shaun Wassell</strong>'s goal is to create a world where people are empowered to use programming as a way to solve meaningful problems‚Äîa world where writing code is just as natural for most people as walking or breathing. To help make this a reality, Shaun has dedicated the past few years to helping people learn and master software-development skills through video courses, live training sessions, and one-on-one tutoring. Shaun has been programming since he was a kid, when creating video games was his gateway into the world of software. Since then, he’s been fortunate enough to be a contributing member on many amazing software projects and work with some incredible mentors along the way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Skill Level</strong><br/>\n<ul><li>Intermediate</li></ul>\n<strong>What You Will Learn</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n\nCompanies have realized that a relatively small team of full-stack developers (developers that work on all parts of a web application) can build and maintain websites much more easily and cost-effectively than if there were separate frontend, backend, and database teams.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Learn How To:</strong><br/>\n<ul><li>Build full-stack applications using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB</li><li>Use network requests and REST APIs to communicate between the front- and backend</li><li>Correctly divide application logic between the front- and backend</li><li>Structure full-stack applications for maximum readability and ease of maintenance</li><li>Implement an authentication flow that allows users to log in and save data</li><li>Integrate powerful third-party APIs into your full-stack applications</li></ul>\n<strong>Who Should Take This Course</strong><br/>\n<ul><li>JavaScript developers, web developers</li></ul>\n<strong>Course Requirements</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Prerequisites:</strong><br/>\n<ul><li>Working knowledge of JavaScript</li><li>Some experience working on either the front- or backend of a web application, but this isn’t a requirement</li></ul>\n<strong>About Pearson Video Training</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n\nPearson publishes expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

    "description": "<span><div><p>You work in a loop: write code, get feedback, iterate. The faster you get feedback, the faster you can learn and become a more effective developer. Test-Driven React helps you refine your React workflow to give you the feedback you need as quickly as possible. Write strong tests and run them continuously as you work, split complex code up into manageable pieces, and stay focused on what's important by automating away mundane, trivial tasks. Adopt these techniques and you'll be able to avoid productivity traps and start building React components at a stunning pace!</p><p>React has revolutionized web development by abstracting away the details of DOM manipulation. That conceptual elegance has opened the door to a new generation of web testing: clear, expressive, and lightning-fast. That makes React a perfect fit for test-driven development (TDD), a methodology in which tests are a blueprint instead of an afterthought.</p><p>Each chapter will present new projects to challenge you and new tools to help you. Write fast, portable tests with Jest. Keep your code tidy with ESLint and Prettier. Perform every task you need from a single window with VS Code. See your test output directly in your code with Wallaby. Use the JavaScript features of the future with Babel. Make assertions about React component behavior with Enzyme. And style components in a testable way with styled-components. By understanding every piece of your project's stack, you'll feel more confident and able to focus on what matters: writing reliable and maintainable code.</p><p>Discover a more joyful React development experience. Let your tests lead the way!</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>You'll need a working knowledge of JavaScript and a computer running macOS, Windows, or Linux.</p></div></span>",

Today React.js is used by Facebook, Instagram, Khan Academy, and Imperial College London, to name a few. Many new users recognize the benefits of React.js and adopt it in their own projects, forming a fast-growing community. The speed at which React.js has evolved promises a bright future for those who invest in learning it today.</p><p>React.js Essentials will take you on a fast-paced journey through building your own maintainable React.js application. Begin by exploring how you can create single and multiple user interface elements. Create stateless and stateful components and make them reactive, learn to interact between your components and lifecycle methods and gauge how to effectively integrate your user interface components with other JavaScript libraries. Delve deep into the core elements of the Flux architecture and learn how to manage your application using stores. Finish by going that extra mile with the Jest test framework, running multiple tests on your application and find solutions to scale it further without complexity.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>The book adopts a step-by-step, hands-on approach with ample codes to ensure you learn React.js at a fast pace.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book.

Using React alongside PWA technology will make it easy for you to build a fast, beautiful, and functional web app.</p><p>After an introduction and brief overview of the goals of PWAs, the book moves on to setting up the application structure. From there, it covers the Webpack build process and the process of creating React components. You'll learn how to set up the backend database and authentication solution to communicate with Firebase and how to work with React Router. Next, you will create and configure your web app manifest, making your PWA installable on mobile devices. Then you'll get introduced to service workers and see how they work as we configure the app to send push notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging. We'll also explore the App Shell pattern, a key concept in PWAs and look at its advantages regarding efficient performance. Finally, you'll learn how to add offline capabilities to the app with caching and confirm your progress by auditing your PWA with Lighthouse. Also, you'll discover helper libraries and shortcuts that will help you save time and understand the future of PWA development.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This is a step-by-step book, wherein, you will use the React framework to create a complete progressive web app.</p></span>",

This is achievable with reactive programming; however, the development of these kinds of systems is a complex task, requiring a deep understanding of the domain. In order to develop highly responsive systems, the developers of the Spring Framework came up with Project Reactor.\n</p><p>Hands-On Reactive Programming in Spring 5 begins with the fundamentals of Spring Reactive programming. You'll explore the endless possibilities of building efficient reactive systems with the Spring 5 Framework along with other tools such as WebFlux and Spring Boot. Further on, you'll study reactive programming techniques and apply them to databases and cross-server communication. You will advance your skills in scaling up Spring Cloud Streams and run independent, high-performant reactive microservices.\n</p><p>By the end of the book, you will be able to put your skills to use and get on board with the reactive revolution in Spring 5.1!</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Discover the difference between a reactive system and reactive programming\n</li><li>Explore the benefits of a reactive system and understand its applications\n</li><li>Get to grips with using reactive programming in Spring 5\n</li><li>Gain an understanding of Project Reactor\n</li><li>Build a reactive system using Spring 5 and Project Reactor\n</li><li>Create a highly efficient reactive microservice with Spring Cloud\n</li><li>Test, monitor, and release reactive applications</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book is for Java developers who use Spring to develop their applications and want to build robust and reactive applications that can scale in the cloud.

    "description": "Stephen Pember explores the various definitions of reactive and reactive programming with the goal of providing techniques for building efficient, scalable applications. Steve dives into the key concepts of Reactive Streams and examines some sample implementations—including how ThirdChannel is currently using reactive libraries in production code. Steve looks at some of the open source options available in the JVM—including Reactor, RxJava, and Ratpack—giving attendees an idea of where to begin with the reactive ecosystem. If reactive is new to you, this should be an excellent introduction.",

By the end of this book you will be able to build and deploy React applications using the Next.js framework to fully render server-side HTML on every Web page.</p><p></p><p>You'll begin by reviewing JavaScript fundamentals and how they work with the core principles of React. You'll then move on to Next.js, the React framework for server-rendered applications. Using this framework, you will create a fast and secure solutional React application that renders content on the server-side, protects sensitive information, and optimizes response times.

Today, thousands of companies worldwide are using React, including big names such as Netflix and AirBnB. React has become immensely popular, such that a number of apps have been ported to React -- including WhatsApp, Instagram and Dropbox.</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>This book is a collection of tutorials, selected from SitePoint's React Hub, that will guide you through your first days with the amazingly flexible library.</p></div></span>",

This book covers the essential functional reactive concepts that will help you build highly concurrent, event-driven, and asynchronous applications in a simpler and less error-prone way. </p><p>C++ Reactive Programming begins with a discussion on how event processing was undertaken by different programming systems earlier. After a brisk introduction to modern C++ (C++17), you'll be taken through language-level concurrency and the lock-free programming model to set the stage for our foray into the Functional Programming model. Following this, you'll be introduced to RxCpp and its programming model. You'll be able to gain deep insights into the RxCpp library, which facilitates reactive programming. You'll learn how to deal with reactive programming using Qt/C++ (for the desktop) and C++ microservices for the Web.  </p><p>By the end of the book, you will be well versed with advanced reactive programming concepts in modern C++ (C++17).</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Understand language-level concurrency in C++</li><li>Explore advanced C++ programming for the FRP</li><li>Uncover the RxCpp library and its programming model</li><li>Mix the FP and OOP constructs in C++ 17 to write well-structured programs</li><li>Master reactive microservices in C++</li><li>Create custom operators for RxCpp</li><li>Learn advanced stream processing and error handling</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>If you're a C++ developer interested in using reactive programming to build asynchronous and concurrent applications, you'll find this book extremely useful.

    "description": "<span><div><p>Still chugging along with a monolithic enterprise system that’s difficult to scale and maintain, and even harder to understand? In this concise book, Lightbend CTO Jonas Bonér explains why microservice-based architecture that consists of small, independent services is far more flexible than the traditional all-in-one systems that continue to dominate today’s enterprise landscape.</p><p>You’ll explore a microservice architecture, based on Reactive principles, for building an isolated service that’s scalable, resilient to failure, and combines with other services to form a cohesive whole. Specifically, you’ll learn how a Reactive microservice isolates everything (including failure), acts autonomously, does one thing well, owns state exclusively, embraces asynchronous message passing, and maintains mobility.</p><p>Bonér also demonstrates how Reactive microservices communicate and collaborate with other services to solve problems. Get a copy of this exclusive report and find out how to bring your enterprise system into the 21st century.</p><p><i>Jonas Bonér is Founder and CTO of Lightbend, inventor of the Akka project, co-author of the Reactive Manifesto and a Java Champion.

Are you already using React Hooks but not sure you are doing the right thing? Or maybe you are sometimes getting tripped up by some of the React Hooks details?</p><p>The addition of the Hooks API to React was quite a major change. Before React Hooks, most components had to be class-based. Now, with Hooks, these are often much simpler functional components. Hooks can be really simple to use. There are still plenty of ways you can mess up with React Hooks. And it often turns out there are many ways where you can improve your components by a better understanding of how each React Hook can be used.</p><p>In this course, you are not just going to look at how to use React Hooks but also go behind the scenes and dive into the source code of React and the React ESLint rules to see why Hooks work the way they do.</p><p>Here, you will learn all about using React Hooks and the pros and cons of the various Hooks. You will learn when to use useState() versus useReducer(). You will look at using useContext() efficiently. You will see when to use useLayoutEffect() and when useEffect() is better. You will be creating several reusable custom Hooks.</p><p>Finally, you will combine all you learned into a more complete utility library to show how it all comes together.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will have learned all about React Hooks with TypeScript.</p><p><b>Audience</b></p><p>This course is ideal for React developers wanting to learn how to use Hooks and developers that want to understand how React Hooks work under the hood.</p><p>A basic understanding of React and functional components is required along with a computer with Node, NPM, a modern browser such as Chrome or Firefox, and a code editor you like. Basic knowledge of TypeScript and React Hooks is useful but not mandatory.</p></span>",

If you already have some JavaScript knowledge or are using React on the web, then you will be able to quickly get up and running with React Native for iOS and Android.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Set up the React Native environment on both devices and emulators</li><li>Gain an in-depth understanding of how React Native works behind the scenes</li><li>Write your own custom native UI components</li><li>Learn the ins and outs of screen navigation</li><li>Master the art of layout and styles</li><li>Work with device-exclusive data such as geolocation</li><li>Develop native modules in Objective-C and Java that interact with JavaScript</li><li>Test and deploy your application for a production-ready environment</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>React Native is a game-changing approach to hybrid mobile development. Web developers can leverage their existing skills to write mobile applications in JavaScript that are truly native without using cross-compilation or web views. These applications have all of the advantages of those written in Objective-C or Java, combined with the rapid development cycle that JavaScript developers are accustomed to.</p><p>Web developers who want to develop native mobile applications face a high barrier to entry, because they are forced to learn platform-specific languages and frameworks. Numerous hybrid technologies have tried to simplify this process, but have failed to achieve the performance and appearance that users expect.</p><p>This book will show you all the advantages of true native development that React Native has without the steep learning curve, leveraging the knowledge you already have. We do this by getting you up and running quickly with a sample application. Next, we'll introduce you to the fundamentals of creating components and explain how React Native works under the hood. Once you have established a solid foundation, you will dive headfirst into developing a real-world application from start to finish. Along the way, we will demonstrate how to create multiple screens and navigate between them, use layout and style native UI components, and access native APIs such as local storage and geolocation. Finally, we tackle the advanced topic of Native modules, which demonstrates that there are truly no limits to what you can do with React Native.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This book provides a simple and easy way to build mobile applications in JavaScript. Each topic takes you through the life cycle of creating a fully-functional native app, with detailed explanations of the entire process.</p></span>",

The first part requires essential web-master skills (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). The second demands minimal experience with React. And finally for the third it would be helpful to have a basic knowledge of React, Redux, and TypeScript.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Plan, design, and develop different cross-platform desktop apps</li><li>Application architecture with React and local state</li><li>Application architecture with React and Redux store</li><li>Code design with TypeScript interfaces and specialized types</li><li>CSS and component libraries such as Photonkit, Material UI, and React MDL</li><li>HTML5 APIs such as desktop notifications, WebSockets, WebRTC, and others</li><li>Desktop environment integration APIs of NW.js and Electron</li><li>Package and distribute for NW.JS and Electron</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Building and maintaining cross-platform desktop applications with native languages isn't a trivial task. Since it's hard to simulate on a foreign platform, packaging and distribution can be quite platform-specific and testing cross-platform apps is pretty complicated.In such scenarios, web technologies such as HTML5 and JavaScript can be your lifesaver. HTML5 desktop applications can be distributed across different platforms (Window, MacOS, and Linux) without any modifications to the code.</p><p>The book starts with a walk-through on building a simple file explorer from scratch powered by NW.JS. So you will practice the most exciting features of bleeding edge CSS and JavaScript. In addition you will learn to use the desktop environment integration API, source code protection, packaging, and auto-updating with NW.JS.</p><p>As the second application you will build a chat-system example implemented with Electron and React. While developing the chat app, you will get Photonkit. Next, you will create a screen capturer with NW.JS, React, and Redux.</p><p>Finally, you will examine an RSS-reader built with TypeScript, React, Redux, and Electron. Generic UI components will be reused from the React MDL library. By the end of the book, you will have built four desktop apps. You will have covered everything from planning, designing, and development to the enhancement, testing, and delivery of these apps.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>Filled with real world examples, this book teaches you to build cross-platform desktop apps right from scratch using a step-by-step approach.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>The Plain-English Guide to Electronics and Current Flow for Every PCB Designer</p><p>Today, PCB designers must deal with issues such as crosstalk and EMI-–issues that were once associated only with components. This requires electronics knowledge that many PCB designers never gain through formal training. In PCB Currents, renowned PCB designer Douglas Brooks teaches these essentials descriptively, in plain English, with as little reliance on mathematics as possible. Building on his widely praised seminars, Brooks explains what current is, how it flows, and how it reacts. He begins by reviewing the nature of current, and then explains current flow in basic circuits, discusses sources that supply and drive current, and addresses the unique problems associated with current on PCBs. Brooks concludes by thoroughly illuminating signal integrity issues caused by current flow. He offers practical design solutions for each common type of problem, as well as for complex challenges involving very high frequency harmonics and very short wavelengths.</p><p>Coverage includes</p><p>• Current: its fundamental nature, basic definitions, and key concepts</p><p>• Five fundamental laws of current, including Kirchoff’s law and Ohm’s law</p><p>• Basic circuit concepts: resistive circuits, reactive circuits, and impedance</p><p>• Voltage and current sources: Where electrons come from and why they move</p><p>• Current-related PCB issues: temperature, transmission lines, reflections, coupled currents, power distribution, skin effect, dielectric losses, and vias</p><p>• Solutions for signal integrity issues caused by current flow, from on-board inductance and apparent resistance changes to more complex problems</p><p>The text is written to be accessible and valuable for PCB designers at all levels of experience, whether they have engineering training or not.</p></div></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><strong>7.5 Hours of Video Instruction</strong><br/><br/>\nSpring is the most used framework for building services and applications and getting them to production. Today’s applications need to scale more and more to handle more users and content with the increasing demand. <em><strong>Reactive Spring Boot LiveLessons, Third Edition</strong></em>, by Josh Long, Spring Developer Advocate, introduces key concepts of reactive programming and examines different aspects of the Spring ecosystem that lend themselves to the functional and reactive style of programming.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese videos not only show you where to start and how to build these applications, but they also provide a solid foundation that will allow you to apply the skills learned to other parts of the Spring ecosystem that build on these core concepts. The Third Edition has been updated and expanded to cover GraphQL.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Customer Review</strong><br/>\n<blockquote><em>(5 Stars)</em> “A great walkthrough of all the reactive capabilities of Spring Boot, and then some!”<br/>\n  --<em>O’Reilly Online Learning reviewer</em><br/>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\n<strong>Skill Level</strong><br/>\n<ul><li>Intermediate</li></ul>\n<br/>\n<strong>Learn How To</strong><br/>\n<ul><li>Examine the different aspects of the Spring ecosystem that lend themselves to the functional and reactive style of programming</li><li>Explore Reactive Data Access using Spring Data and Spring Data MongoDB</li><li>Understand the Reactive Streams specification as a compatibility layer and how to use the Reactive Stream types as a mechanism for interoperability across OS projects</li><li>Test reactive applications</li><li>Consume data from a publisher in Spring Integration and from a publisher in Spring Cloud Stream</li><li>Use Spring Cloud Function</li><li>Build Edge Services</li></ul>\n<br/>\n<strong>Who Should Take This Course</strong><br/>\n<ul><li>Existing or new Spring users</li><li>Experienced Java developers</li></ul>\n<br/>\n<strong>Course Requirements</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nBasic Java familiarity. The course uses Java 8, although Spring Boot and most Spring projects support Java 6.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson Descriptions</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nLesson 1, “Basics,” examines what motivates the move to reactive programming and how it is supported in the Reactive Streams specification.<br/>\n<br/>\nLesson 2, “Data,” covers the importance of data and how Spring supports non-blocking data access for any NoSQL and SQL data stores.<br/>\n<br/>\nLesson 3, “HTTP Services,” focuses on what reactive programming means in an HTTP environment. It introduces functional reactive HTTP handlers, `@RestController`-style controllers, reactive server-sent event streams and more.<br/>\n<br/>\nLesson 4, “WebSockets,” focuses on Websockets, a binary protocol that supports bi-directional communication. This lesson examines how websockets, which are an extension to HTTP, integrate with Reactive Streams.<br/>\n<br/>\nLesson 5, “HTTP Clients,” briefly reviews the `Webclient`, the reactive HTTP client. It also discusses some patterns that clients will care about when dealing with distributed services.<br/>\n<br/>\nLesson 6, “RSocket,” covers this protocol designed by engineers at Netflix and then Facebook. It’s a binary protocol that supports bi-directional communication and is used for service-to-service communication. This lesson covers the motivations for using RSocket, Raw RSocket, and RSocket in Spring.<br/>\n<br/>\nLesson 7, “GraphQL,” a protocol developed at Facebook, is a way to build data integration gateways and changes the way edge services are built. This lesson introduces GraphQL, GraphQL Schema and the Domain. It also covers low level “RuntimeWiring Configurer”, queries, mutations, and subscriptions. This lesson also introduces the new Spring GraphQL.<br/>\n<br/>\nLesson 8, “Security,” shows how Spring Security works flawlessly to protect HTTP and RSocket-based services.<br/>\n<br/>\nLesson 9, “Gateway,” examines how to use Spring Cloud Gateway and how it is used to act as an API gateway for HTTP- and RSocket-based services.<br/>\n<br/>\nLesson 10, “Reactive Streams Redux,” focuses on the Reactive Streams specification as a compatibility layer and shows how to use the Reactive Stream types as a mechanism for interoperability across open source projects like Akka Streams, Vert.x. Spring Web Flux, and Spring Data.<br/>\n<br/>\nLesson 11, “Reactive Streams Redux,” briefly reviews testing reactive applications and covers Reactive data access, Reactive web services, and how to test reactive microservices.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>About the Instructor</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Josh Long</strong> (@starbuxman) is the Spring Developer Advocate at Pivotal.

Today, there is renewed interest and adoption of this technology for building distributed systems, especially as cloud concurrency challenges increase. As this report explains, the Actor model provides a relatively simple but powerful way to design and implement reactive applications that can distribute work across clusters of cores and servers.</p><p>Author Hugh McKee shows you how Actors behave and interact as humans do when it comes to communicating, and how these similar behavioral patterns provide basic intuition when designing reactive systems. Actors allow your teams to focus on an application’s business logic rather than on low-level protocols, accelerating time-to-market while keeping your infrastructure costs low.</p><p>Download this report and discover:</p><ul><li>Why actor-based systems are one of the foundational technologies for creating microservice architectures</li><li>How Actors delegate work by creating other Actors in a supervisor-to-worker relationship</li><li>How Actors manage requests and scale horizontally in large systems</li><li>The difference between traditional systems and actor-based systems</li><li>How an Actor system forms clusters when the flow of work exceeds a system’s capacity to process it</li><li>Why failure detection and failure recovery is an architectural feature of Actor systems</li><li>An example of using Actors to build an Internet of Things (IoT) application</li></ul><p>Hugh McKee is a solutions architect at Lightbend. Prior to this role he served as a software architect and engineer at HP, where he helped build the core frameworks and platform that support the organization’s internal application teams.

    "title": "Beginning React and Firebase: Create Four Beginner-Friendly Projects Using React and Firebase",
    "description": "<span><p>Use React with Firebase to build four beginner-friendly apps. A lot of React tutorials out there today only cover basic web apps, but with additional features the web apps included in this book can be converted into fully scaled startups.</p>\n\nYou will start with the basics: learn to deploy a React app with Firebase hosting. Next, you will learn to create a fully functional \"ToDo\" app that will use Firebase database to store a list action items. You will also learn to create a \"Stories\" app, in which you can show short vertical videos, and a document storage app. Here, we will be able to log in using Google Authentication, and will learn to store files in the app using Firebase storage.

You’ll learn how to do the following:</p><p/><ul><li>Set up a Firestore database</li><li>Push and read data from our database</li><li>Update and delete data</li><li>Sort and filter data</li><li>Work with real-time data using onSnapshot</li></ul><p>This course will guide you in using Firebase to handle authentication. Users can sign up and log in and out, allowing them to have their own personal boards that only they can see and edit. You’ll also take advantage of React's Context API to pass the user's auth state throughout your application and handle conditional rendering. To round things off, you’ll look at how to build your project for production and then deploy it for the world to see!</p></span>",

It helps to have some familiarity with React, but if you are an experienced web developer looking at React, then this book will show you how to build a resilient toolset around you before you begin.</p><b>What You Will Learn</b><ul><li>Bootstrap a React application using create-react-app</li><li>Isolate React component development using Storybook</li><li>Write effective unit tests for your React components using Jest</li><li>Ensure that your component code is to standard using ESLint</li><li>Use browser extensions and built-in component instrumentation to debug React applications</li><li>Enable type safety in React components with Flowtype</li><li>Deploy React applications inside a Docker container as part of a larger application stack</li></ul><b>In Detail</b><p>React 16 Tooling covers the most important tools, utilities, and libraries that every React developer needs to know - in detail. As React has grown, the amazing toolset around it has also grown, adding features and enhancing the development workflow. Each of these essential tools is presented in a practical manner and in a logical order mirroring the development workflow. These tools will make your development life simpler and happier, enabling you to create better and more performant apps.</p><p>Adam starts with a hand-picked selection of the best tools for the React 16 ecosystem. For starters, there's the create-react-app utility that's officially supported by the React team. Not only does this tool bootstrap your React project for you, it also provides a consistent and stable framework to build upon. The premise is that when you don't have to think about meta development work, more focus goes into the product itself.</p><p>Other React tools follow this same approach to automating and improving your development life. Jest makes unit testing quicker. Flow makes catching errors easier. Docker containers make deployment in a stack simpler. Storybook makes developing components straightforward. ESLint makes writing standardized code faster. The React DevTools plugin makes debugging a cinch. React 16 Tooling clears away the barriers so you can focus on developing the good parts. In this book, we'll look at each of these powerful tools in detail, showing you how to build the perfect React ecosystem to develop your apps within.</p><b>Style and approach</b><p>This book covers React tools that help developers with the most relevant challenges they face today. Each chapter begins by defining the challenge faced by developers and why the tool is required, then shows how to fix the problem using React tooling.</p></span>",

Using VRRP to\navoid network outages is essential to building accessible, robust\nnetworks, and central to the implementation of successful disaster\nrecovery models. Written by experts who contributed to the design\nof the VRRP protocol and participated actively in its deployment,\n<em><b>VRRP: Increasing Reliability and Failover with the Virtual\nRouter Redundancy Protocol</b></em> is your best introduction to\nthis powerful high-availability tool.</p><p><b><em>VRRP</em></b> examines the general characteristics of the\nprotocol and its usage. The emphasis is on translating the protocol\nspecification into a tutorial form ideal for day-to-day users of\nVRRP. In addition to introducing the technology, this book provides\nan in-depth analysis, featuring extensive material on configuring,\nmanaging, and troubleshooting VRRP. Precursors to this protocol,\nsuch as Cisco's HSRP and DEC's IPSTP, are also discussed. Various\nvendor-specific extensions to VRRP--and their use in solving\nspecific high-availability problems not addressed by VRRP--are also\nexamined.</p><p>Network administrators and managers, protocol implementers,\npracticing professionals, researchers, and students exploring the\narea of high availability will gain a solid understanding of the\ncore concepts of reliability and redundancy based on VRRP, as well\nas the particulars of the VRRP protocol and how to implement\nit.</p><p>The appendixes provide the necessary background for networking\nand TCP/IP, the full text of VRRP MIB, a study of actual VRRP\nimplementations and an analysis of public-domain software available\nfor VRRP over Linux, an overview of the VRRP state machine using\nSDL flowcharts and UML diagrams, and an analysis of the protocol\nthrough formal logic.</p><p><br/><br/>\n0201715007B09052002</p></span></span></span>",

But what does this mean? Well, it combines the best parts of React, Webpack, React-router, GraphQL, and other front-end tools and creates one amazing tool that developers can enjoy using! With Gatsby.js, you can use modern web tech without the headaches. Everything will be set up, waiting for you to start building.</p><p>One of the best things about Gatsby is that you can bring in your own data from headless CMS, APIs, databases, or file systems. There is no limit. You can even source data from WordPress and this makes it very easy for clients to interact with the website you've built for them and add new content. They just need to update their posts on WordPress and that's it. Also, with Gatsby you will not build a website with last decade's tech.</p><p>The future of the web is mobile, JavaScript and APIs—the JAMstack. Every website is a web app and every web app is a website. With Gatsby, it is very easy to make your project a static Progressive Web App (PWA). You get code and data splitting out-of-the-box. Gatsby loads only the critical HTML, CSS, data, and JavaScript so your site loads as fast as possible. Once loaded, Gatsby prefetches resources for other pages so clicking around the site feels incredibly fast. Gatsby.js builds the fastest possible website. Instead of waiting to generate pages when requested, pre-build pages and lift them into a global cloud of servers—ready to be delivered instantly to your users wherever they are.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><div>In this third video, finish building a complex and practical web application anywhere with a minimalistic setup. Not only will you get to experience technologies used in famous enterprise web applications, you will  also be able to code using only your iPad and a Raspberry Pi. The common misconception is that you can only use your iPad for small code changes, or small code additions while on the go. You will learn that you can do so much more and code an entire application with just your iPad and Raspberry Pi.    <div><br/></div><div>In this third and final video, you’ll build the front-end of your application. For this, we’ll use React JS—the most common JavaScript framework. We’ll also work with Tailwind CSS, which makes developers' lives easier by pre-defining styles while not imposing them over the final design. You’ll integrate both with your Spring Boot Rest API, which will result in a solid, enterprise level web application.</div><div><br/></div><div><b>What You'll Learn</b></div><div><ul><li>Develop the front-end of your application <br/></li><li>Apply styles and design patterns with Tailwind CSS<br/></li><li>Take full stack development to another, mobile level  <br/></li></ul></div><div><br/></div><div><b>Who This Video Is For</b></div><div>Tech enthusiasts who want to use only an iPad and a Raspberry Pi to build complex web applications on the go.

    "description": "<span><span><p/><p>The Plain-English Guide to Electronics and Current Flow for Every PCB Designer</p><p>Today, PCB designers must deal with issues such as crosstalk and EMI-–issues that were once associated only with components. This requires electronics knowledge that many PCB designers never gain through formal training. In <i>PCB Currents</i>, renowned PCB designer Douglas Brooks teaches these essentials descriptively, in plain English, with as little reliance on mathematics as possible. Building on his widely praised seminars, Brooks explains what current is, how it flows, and how it reacts. He begins by reviewing the nature of current, and then explains current flow in basic circuits, discusses sources that supply and drive current, and addresses the unique problems associated with current on PCBs. Brooks concludes by thoroughly illuminating signal integrity issues caused by current flow. He offers practical design solutions for each common type of problem, as well as for complex challenges involving very high frequency harmonics and very short wavelengths.</p><p>Coverage includes\n</p><ul><li>Current: its fundamental nature, basic definitions, and key concepts</li><li>Five fundamental laws of current, including Kirchoff’s law and Ohm’s law</li><li>Basic circuit concepts: resistive circuits, reactive circuits, and impedance</li><li>Voltage and current sources: Where electrons come from and why they move</li><li>Current-related PCB issues: temperature, transmission lines, reflections, coupled currents, power distribution, skin effect, dielectric losses, and vias</li><li>Solutions for signal integrity issues caused by current flow, from on-board inductance and apparent resistance changes to more complex problems</li></ul>\nThe text is written to be accessible and valuable for PCB designers at all levels of experience, whether they have engineering training or not.\n\n\n<p><b>About the Author:</b></p>\n<p><b>Douglas Brooks</b> has a B.S./E.E. and an M.S./E.E. from Stanford University and a Ph.D. from the University of Washington. He has had forty years of experience in the electronics industry, ranging from circuit design engineer on the space program to president of his own manufacturing company. For the past twenty years he has been president of UltraCAD Design, Inc., a premier PCB Design Service Bureau in the Pacific Northwest.</p>\n\n<p>Brooks has published hundreds of articles during his career. In the last twenty years, these articles have appeared in PCB Design Magazine, on Iconnect007’s websites, on Mentor Graphics’ web pages, and on UltraCAD’s web pages. In 2003, he published the book Signal Integrity Issues and Printed Circuit Board Design (Prentice Hall).</p>\n\n<p>Brooks served on the faculty of San Diego State University for three years and was a visiting associate professor at the University of Washington for one year. He has given numerous seminars on Signal Integrity Issues in PCB Design over the past fifteen years all over the United States and in Moscow, Beijing and Shanghai, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia.</p>\n\n<p>Brooks finally retired in 2012.</p>\n\n\n\n</span></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>With microservices taking the software industry by storm, traditional enterprises running large, monolithic Java EE applications have been forced to rethink what they’ve been doing for nearly two decades. But how can microservices built upon reactive principles make a difference?</p><p>In this O’Reilly report, author Markus Eisele walks Java developers through the creation of a complete reactive microservices-based system. You’ll learn that while microservices are not new, the way in which these independent services can be distributed and connected back together certainly is. The result? A system that’s easier to deploy, manage, and scale than a typical Java EE-based infrastructure.</p><p>With this report, you will:</p><ul><li>Get an overview of the Reactive Programming model and basic requirements for developing reactive microservices</li><li>Learn how to create base services, expose endpoints, and then connect them with a simple, web-based user interface</li><li>Understand how to deal with persistence, state, and clients</li><li>Use integration technologies to start a successful migration away from legacy systems</li></ul><p>The detailed example in this report is based on Lagom, a new framework that helps you follow the requirements for building distributed, reactive systems. Available on GitHub as an Apache-licensed open source project, this example is freely available for download.</p></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><div>Understand the newest trend in database programming for developers working in Java, Kotlin, Clojure, and other JVM-based languages. This book introduces Reactive Relational Database Connectivity (R2DBC), a modern way of connecting to and querying relational databases from Java and other JVM languages. The book begins by helping you understand not only what reactive programming is, but why it is necessary. Then building on those fundamentals, the book takes you into the world of databases and the newly released Reactive Relational Database Connectivity (R2DBC) specification. </div><div><br/></div><div>Examples in the book are worked using the freely available MariaDB database along with MariaDB’s vendor-implementation of the R2DBC service-provider interface (SPI). Following along with the examples and the provided example code helps prepare you to work with any of the growing number of R2DBC implementations for popular enterprise databases such as Oracle Database and SQL Server. You’ll be well prepared for what is becoming the future of database access from Java and other languages built on the JVM.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><b>What You Will Learn</b></div><div><div><ul><li><div>Understand why R2DBC was created and how it utilizes the Reactive Streams API </div></li><li><div>Understand the components of the R2DBC service-provider interface</div></li><li><div>Create and manage reactive database connections and connection pools using an R2DBC client</div></li><li><div>Programmatically execute queries on a relational database using an R2DBC client</div></li><li><div>Effectively utilize transactions using an R2DBC client</div></li><li><div>Build relational database-driven applications that are event-driven and non-blocking</div></li></ul></div></div><div><br/></div><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b></div><div><br/></div><div>Software developers building solutions using JVM languages and the JVM ecosystem, and developers who need an introduction to the R2DBC specification and reactive programming with relational databases and want to understand what Reactive Relational Database Connectivity is and why it came about. This book includes practical examples of using the R2DBC specification with Java and MariaDB that will provide developers with the knowledge they need to create their own solutions.<br/></div></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Learn the basics of reactive programming and how it makes apps more responsive. This book shows you how to incorporate reactive programming into existing development products and cycles using RXSwift and RXCocoa on iOS and Mac.<br/></p><p>As we move away from the traditional paradigm of typing or touching one step at a time to interact with programs, users expect apps to adapt and not need constant hand-holding. People today expect their devices to do much more than just follow commands. They expect devices to react and adapt. Reactive programming, a new term for asynchronous processing, requires new app architectures, and you'll learn how these are already built into iOS and macOS in many places.   </p><p>As part of this more complex environment, you'll move beyond Cocoa and Cocoa Touch to incorporate data from Amazon Web Services (AWS), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), and other formats, and standards. Together with the concepts of reactive programming and RxSwift, these tools help you build more powerful and useful apps that have wide appeal and use.</p><p><b>What You'll Learn</b></p><p></p><ul><li>Work with tools such as Darwin microkernel, RxSwift, and RxCocoa<br/></li><li>Use Git repositiories and other resoucrces to get into coding<br/></li><li>Create apps that adapt to gestures and UI interaction as well as what's happening in and around the environment of the app itself.<br/></li></ul><p></p><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div> This book is for Swift programmers interested in learning to create reactive apps with RxSwift.    <b><br/></b></div><p></p><p> </p><p></p></span>",
