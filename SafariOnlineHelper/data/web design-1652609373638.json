This training focuses on what you need to know about DDD to get results.</p><p>Vaughn Vernon draws on several years of experience applying DDD to real-world situations. He is uniquely well-qualified to demystify its complexities, illuminate its subtleties, and help you solve the problems you might encounter.</p><p>Vernon guides you through each core DDD technique for building better software. You’ll learn how to segregate domain models using the powerful Bounded Contexts pattern, to develop a Ubiquitous Language within an explicitly bounded context, and to help domain experts and developers work together to create that language. Vernon shows how to use Subdomains to handle legacy systems and to integrate multiple Bounded Contexts to define both team relationships and technical mechanisms.</p><p><strong>Related Books:</strong></p><p><em>Domain Driven Design Distilled</em></p><p><a href=\"https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/domain-driven-design-distilled/9780134434964/\">https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/domain-driven-design-distilled/9780134434964/</a></p><p><em>Implementing Domain Driven Design</em></p><p><a href=\"https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/implementing-domain-driven-design/9780133039900/\">https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/implementing-domain-driven-design/9780133039900/</a></p><p><strong>About the Instructor </strong></p><p><strong>Vaughn Vernon</strong> is a software developer and architect with more than 30 years of experience in a broad range of business domains. He consults and teaches around Domain-Driven Design and reactive software development, helping teams and organizations realize the potential of business-driven and reactive systems as they transition from technology-driven legacy web implementation approaches. As he does so, he puts strong emphasis on embracing simplicity whenever possible. Vaughn has taught his 3-day Implementing Domain-Driven Design Workshop around the globe to hundreds of software developers. Some of his early exposure to domain modeling, the foundation of domain-driven design, came since 1991 with the use of the Smalltalk programming language. He has continually practiced the tenets of domain modeling since then, and was naturally drawn to Eric Evans’ work on DDD. He is an experienced speaker, having presented at many conferences. He is the founder and principal consultant and trainer at for {comprehension}, a Colorado-based business solutions provider. Vaughn is the author of <em>Implementing Domain Driven Design</em> (Addison-Wesley, 2013), <em>Domain Driven Design Distilled</em> (Addison-Wesley, 2016) and <em>Reactive Messaging Patterns with the Actor Model: Applications and Integration in Scala and Akka</em> (Addison-Wesley, 2015).</p><p><strong>Skill Level</strong></p><ul><li>Intermediate</li></ul><p><strong>What You Will Learn</strong></p><ul><li>What DDD can do for you and your organization‚Äîand why it’s so important</li><li>The cornerstones of strategic design with DDD: Bounded Contexts and Ubiquitous Language</li><li>Strategic design with Subdomains</li><li>Context Mapping: helping teams work together and integrate software more strategically</li><li>Tactical design with Aggregates and Domain Events</li><li>Using project acceleration and management tools to establish and maintain team cadence</li></ul><p><strong>Who Should Take This Course</strong></p><ul><li>Domain-Driven Design Distilled LiveLessons brings DDD to life.

We then show you how to build asynchronous control flow patterns with callbacks, promises and async/await. Next, we dive into Node.js streams, unveiling their power and showing you how to use them at their full capacity. Following streams is an analysis of different creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns that take full advantage of JavaScript and Node.js. Lastly, the book dives into more advanced concepts such as Universal JavaScript, scalability and messaging patterns to help you build enterprise-grade distributed applications.\n</p><p>Throughout the book, you'll see Node.js in action with the help of several real-life examples leveraging technologies such as LevelDB, Redis, RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ, and many others. They will be used to demonstrate a pattern or technique, but they will also give you a great introduction to the Node.js ecosystem and its set of solutions.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Become comfortable with writing asynchronous code by leveraging callbacks, promises, and the async/await syntax\n</li><li>Leverage Node.js streams to create data-driven asynchronous processing pipelines\n</li><li>Implement well-known software design patterns to create production grade applications\n</li><li>Share code between Node.js and the browser and take advantage of full-stack JavaScript\n</li><li>Build and scale microservices and distributed systems powered by Node.js\n</li><li>Use Node.js in conjunction with other powerful technologies such as Redis, RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ, and LevelDB</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book is for developers and software architects who have some prior basic knowledge of JavaScript and Node.js and now want to get the most out of these technologies in terms of productivity, design quality, and scalability. Software professionals with intermediate experience in Node.js and JavaScript will also find valuable the more advanced patterns and techniques presented in this book.\n</p><p>This book assumes that you have an intermediate understanding of web application development, databases, and software design principles.</p></span>",

You'll find everything you need to start creating awesome web designs and layouts with Flexbox code/syntaxes in this course. You won't have to look anywhere else.</li><li>We strongly advocate learning by doing, rather than just listening or reading. Our lectures are filled with a wealth of examples that explain every concept clearly.</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Before Flexbox arrived on the screen, we had to use relative or absolute positioning, floats clears and 100s of lines of code to achieve a decent website layout. All of that's changed now. With CSS Flexbox, you can layout your website's design in just a few lines of code, and even make it responsive! No more frameworks like Bootstrap to make up for the shortcomings in CSS. Become a professional web designer in just a few hours. If you know the very basics of HTML and CSS, you're all set. Spend a few hours learning a bunch of Flexbox syntaxes, and you'll be creating awesome web layouts in no time at all! You don't need to learn a bunch of frameworks to become a pro web designer now! We'll be using a real-world example to explain the concepts.</p><p>All the code and supporting files for this course are available at: https://github.com/PacktPublishing/A-Complete-CSS-Flexbox-Course-and-a-Real-World-Website-Project</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>“<em>SOA Design Patterns</em> is an important contribution to the literature and practice of building and delivering quality software-intensive systems.”</p><p><em>- Grady Booch, IBM Fellow</em></p><p>“With the continued explosion of services and the increased rate of adoption of SOA through the market, there is a critical need for comprehensive, actionable guidance that provides the fastest possible time to results. Microsoft is honored to contribute to the <em>SOA Design Patterns</em> book, and to continue working with the community to realize the value of Real World SOA.”</p><p><em>- Steven Martin, Senior Director, Developer Platform Product Management, Microsoft</em></p><p>“<em>SOA Design Patterns</em> provides the proper guidance with the right level of abstraction to be adapted to each organization’s needs, and Oracle is pleased to have contributed to the patterns contained in this book.”</p><p><em>- Dr. Mohamad Afshar, Director of Product Management, Oracle Fusion Middleware, Oracle</em></p><p>“Red Hat is pleased to be involved in the <em>SOA Design Patterns</em> book and contribute important SOA design patterns to the community that we and our customers have used within our own SOA platforms. I am sure this will be a great resource for future SOA practitioners.”</p><p><em>- Pierre Fricke Director, Product Line Management, JBoss SOA Platform, Red Hat</em></p><p>“A wealth of proven, reusable SOA design patterns, clearly explained and illustrated with examples. An invaluable resource for all those involved in the design of service-oriented solutions.”</p><p><em>- Phil Thomas, Consulting IT Specialist, IBM Software Group</em></p><p>“This obligatory almanac of SOA design patterns will become the foundation on which many organizations will build their successful SOA solutions. It will allow organizations to build their own focused SOA design patterns catalog in an expedited fashion knowing that it contains the wealth and expertise of proven SOA best practices.”</p><p><em>- Stephen Bennett, Director, Technology Business Unit, Oracle Corporation</em></p><p>“The technical differences between service orientation and object orientation are subtle</p><p>enough to confuse even the most advanced developers. Thomas Erl’s book provides a great service by clearly articulating SOA design patterns and differentiating them from similar OO design patterns.”</p><p><em>- Anne Thomas Manes, VP &amp; Research Director, Burton Group</em></p><p>“<em>SOA Design Patterns</em> does an excellent job of laying out and discussing the areas of SOA design that a competent SOA practitioner should understand and employ.”</p><p><em>- Robert Laird, SOA Architect, IBM</em></p><p>“As always, Thomas delivers again. In a well-structured and easy-to-understand way, this book provides a wonderful collection of patterns each addressing a typical set of SOA design problems with well articulated solutions. The plain language and hundreds of diagrams included in the book help make the complicated subjects of SOA design comprehensible even to those who are new to the SOA design world. It’s a must-have reference book for all SOA practitioners, especially for enterprise architects, solution architects, developers, managers, and business process experts.”</p><p><em>- Canyang Kevin Liu, Solution Architecture Manager, SAP</em></p><p>“The concept of service oriented architecture has long promised visions of agile organizations being able to swap out interfaces and applications as business needs change. SOA also promises incredible developer and IT productivity, with the idea that key services would be candidates for cross-enterprise sharing or reuse. But many organizations’ efforts to move to SOA have been mired–by organizational issues, by conflicting vendor messages, and by architectures that may amount to little more than Just a Bunch of Web Services. There’s been a lot of confusion in the SOA marketplace about exactly what SOA is, what it’s supposed to accomplish, and how an enterprise goes about in making it work.</p><p><em>SOA Design Patterns</em> is a definitive work that offers clarity on the purpose and functioning of service oriented architecture. SOA Design Patterns not only helps the IT practitioner lay the groundwork for a well-functioning SOA effort across the enterprise, but also connects the dots between SOA and the business requirements in a very concrete way. Plus, this book is completely technology agnostic—<em>SOA Design Patterns</em> rightly focuses on infrastructure and architecture, and it doesn’t matter whether you’re using components of one kind or another, or Java, or .NET, or Web services, or REST-style interfaces.</p><p>While no two SOA implementations are alike, Thomas Erl and his team of contributors have effectively identified the similarities in composition services need to have at a sub-atomic level in order to interact with each other as we hope they will. The book identifies 85 SOA design patterns which have been developed and thoroughly vetted to ensure that a service-oriented architecture does achieve the flexibility and loose coupling promised. The book is also compelling in that it is a living document, if you will, inviting participation in an open process to identify and formulate new patterns to this growing body of knowledge.”</p><p><em>- Joe McKendrick, Independent Analyst, Author of ZDNet’s SOA Blog</em></p><p>“If you want to truly educate yourself on SOA, read this book.”</p><p><em>- Sona Srinivasan, Global Client Services &amp; Operations, CISCO</em></p><p>“An impressive decomposition of the process and architectural elements that support serviceoriented analysis, design, and delivery. Right-sized and terminologically consistent.</p><p>Overall, the book represents a patient separation of concerns in respect of the process and architectural parts that underpin any serious SOA undertaking. Two things stand out. First, the pattern relationship diagrams provide rich views into the systemic relationships that structure a service-oriented architecture: these patterns are not discrete, isolated templates to be applied mechanically to the problem space; rather, they form a network of forces and constraints that guide the practitioner to consider the task at hand in the context of its inter-dependencies. Second, the pattern sequence diagrams and accompanying notes provide a useful framework for planning and executing the many activities that comprise an SOA engagement.”</p><p><em>- Ian Robinson, Principal Technology Consultant, ThoughtWorks</em></p><p>“Successful implementation of SOA principles requires a shift in focus from software system means, or the way capabilities are developed, to the desired end results, or real-world effects required to satisfy organizational business processes. In <em>SOA Design Patterns</em>, Thomas Erl provides service architects with a broad palette of reusable service patterns that describe service capabilities that can cut across many SOA applications. Service architects taking advantage of these patterns will save a great deal of time describing and assembling services to deliver the real world effects they need to meet their organization’s specific business objectives.”</p><p><em>- Chuck Georgo, Public Safety and National Security Architect</em></p><p>“In IT, we have increasingly come to see the value of having catalogs of good solution patterns in programming and systems design. With this book, Thomas Erl brings a comprehensive set of patterns to bear on the world of SOA. These patterns enable easily communicated, reusable, and effective solutions, allowing us to more rapidly design and build out the large, complicated and interoperable enterprise SOAs into which our IT environments are evolving.”</p><p><em>- Al Gough, Business Systems Solutions CTO, CACI International Inc.</em></p><p>“This book provides a comprehensive and pragmatic review of design issues in service-centric design, development, and evolution. The Web site related to this book [SOAPatterns.org] is a wonderful platform and gives the opportunity for the software community to maintain this catalogue….”</p><p><em>- Veronica Gacitua Decar, Dublin City University</em></p><p>“Erl’s <em>SOA Design Patterns</em> is for the IT decision maker determined to make smart architecture design choices, smart investments, and long term enterprise impact. For those IT professionals committed to service-orientation as a value-added design and implementation option, Patterns offers a credible, repeatable approach to engineering an adaptable business enterprise. This is a must read for all IT architect professionals.”</p><p><em>- Larry Gloss, VP and General Manager, Information Manufacturing, LLC</em></p><p>“These SOA patterns define, encompass, and comprise a complete repertoire of best practices for developing a world-class IT SOA portfolio for the enterprise and its organizational units through to service and schema analysis and design. After many years as an architect on many SOA projects, I strongly recommend this book be on the shelf of every analyst and technical member of any SOA effort, right next to the SOA standards and guidelines it outlines and elucidates the need for. Our SOA governance standards draw heavily from this work and others from this series.”</p><p><em>- Robert John Hathaway III, Enterprise Software Architect, SOA Object Systems</em></p><p>“A wise man once told me that wisdom isn’t all about knowledge and intelligence, it is just as much about asking questions. Asking questions is the true mark of wisdom and during the writing of the <em>SOA Design Patterns</em> book Thomas Erl has shown his real qualities. The community effort behind this book is huge meaning that Thomas has had access to the knowledge and experience of a large group of accomplished practitioners. The result speaks for itself. This book is packed with proven solutions to recurring problems, and the documented pros and cons of each solution have been verified by persons with true experience. This book could give SOA initiatives of any scale a real boost.”</p><p><em>- Herbjörn Wilhelmsen, Architect and Senior Consultant, Objectware</em></p><p>“This book is an absolute milestone in SOA literature. For the first time we are provided with a practical guide on how the principle centric description of service orientation from a vendor-agnostic viewpoint is actually made to work in a language based on patterns. This book makes you talk SOA! There are very few who understand SOA like Thomas Erl does, he actually put’s it all together!”</p><p><em>- Brian Lokhorst, Solution Architect, Dutch Tax Office</em></p><p>“Service oriented architecture is all about best practices we have learned since IT’s existence. This book takes all those best practices and bundles them into a nice pattern catalogue. [It provides] a really excellent approach as patterns are not just documented but are provided with application scenarios through case studies [which] fills the gap between theory and practice.”</p><p><em>- Shakti Sharma, Senior Enterprise Architect, Sysco Corp</em></p><p>“An excellent and important book on solving problems in SOA [with a] solid structure. Has the potential of being among the major influential books.”</p><p><em>- Peter Chang, Lawrence Technical University</em></p><p>“<em>SOA Design Patterns</em> presents a vast amount of knowledge about how to successfully implement SOA within an organization. The information is clear, concise, and most importantly, legitimate.”</p><p><em>- Peter B. Woodhull, President and Principal Architect, Modus21</em></p><p>“<em>SOA Design Patterns</em> offers real insights into everyday problems that one will encounter when investing in services oriented architecture. [It] provides a number of problem descriptions and offers strategies for dealing with these problems. SOA design patterns highlights more than just the technical problems and solutions. Common organizational issues that can hinder progress towards achieving SOA migration are explained along with potential approaches for dealing with these real world challenges. Once again Thomas Erl provides in-depth coverage of SOA terminology and helps the reader better understand and appreciate the complexities of migrating to an SOA environment.”</p><p><em>- David Michalowicz, Air and Space Operations Center Modernization Team Lead,</em></p><p><em>MITRE Corporation</em></p><p>“This is a long overdue, serious, comprehensive, and well-presented catalog of SOA design patterns. This will be required reading and reference for all our SOA engineers and architects. The best of the series so far!</p><p>[The book] works in two ways: as a primer in SOA design and architecture it can easily be read front-to-back to get an overview of most of the key design issues you will encounter, and as a reference catalog of design techniques that can be referred to again and again…”</p><p><em>- Wendell Ocasio, Architecture Consultant, DoD Military Health Systems, Agilex Technologies</em></p><p>“Thomas has once again provided the SOA practitioner with a phenomenal collection of</p><p>knowledge. This is a reference that I will come back to time and time again as I move forward in SOA design efforts.</p><p>What I liked most about this book is its vendor agnostic approach to SOA design patterns. This approach really presents the reader with an understanding of why or why not to implement a pattern, group patterns, or use compound patterns rather than giving them a marketing spiel on why one implementation of a pattern is better than another (for example, why one ESB is better than another). I think as SOA adoption continues to advance, the ability for architects to understand when and why to apply specific patterns will be a driving factor in the overall success and evolution of SOA. Additionally, I believe that this book provides the consumer with the understanding required to chose which vendor’s SOA products are right for their specific needs.”</p><p><em>- Bryan Brew, SOA Consultant, Booz Allen Hamilton</em></p><p>“A must have for every SOA practitioner.”</p><p><em>- Richard Van Schelven, Principal Engineer, Ericsson</em></p><p>“This book is a long-expected successor to the books on object-oriented design patterns and integration patterns. It is a great reference book that clearly and thoroughly describes design patterns for SOA. A great read for architects who are facing the challenge of transforming their enterprise into a service-oriented enterprise.”</p><p><em>- Linda Terlouw, Solution Architect, Ordina</em></p><p>“The maturation of Service-Orientation has given the industry time to absorb the best practices of service development. Thomas Erl has amassed this collective wisdom in <em>SOA Design Patterns</em>, an absolutely indispensible addition to any Service Oriented bookshelf.”</p><p><em>- Kevin P. Davis, Ph.D</em></p><p>“The problem with most texts on SOA is one of specificity. Architects responsible for SOA implementation in most organizations have little time for abstract theories on the subject, but are hungry for concrete details that they can relate to the real problems they face in their environment. <em>SOA Design Patterns</em> is critical reading for anyone with service design responsibilities. Not only does the text provide the normal pattern templates, but each pattern is applied in detail against a background case study to provide exceptionally meaningful context to the information. The graphic visualizations of the problems and pattern solutions are excellent supplementary companions to the explanatory text. This book will greatly stretch the knowledge of the reader as much for raising and addressing issues that may have never occurred to the reader as it does in treating those problems that are in more common occurrence. The real beauty of this book is in its plain English prose. Unlike so many technical reference books, one does not find themselves re-reading sections multiple times trying to discern the intent of the author. This is also not a reference that will sit gathering dust on a shelf after one or two perusings. Practitioners will find themselves returning over and over to utilize the knowledge in their projects. This is as close as you’ll come to having a service design expert sitting over your shoulder.”</p><p><em>- James Kinneavy, Principal Software Architect, University of California</em></p><p>“As the industry converges on SOA patterns, Erl provides an outstanding reference guide to composition and integration–and yet another distinctive contribution to the SOA practice.”</p><p><em>- Steve Birkel, Chief IT Technical Architect, Intel Corp.</em></p><p>“With <em>SOA Design Patterns</em>, Thomas Erl adds an indispensable SOA reference volume to the technologist’s library. Replete with to-the-point examples, it will be a helpful aid to any IT organization.”</p><p><em>- Ed Dodds, Strategist, Systems Architect, Conmergence</em></p><p>“Again, Thomas Erl has written an indispensable guide to SOA. Building on his prior successes, his patterns go into even more detail. Therefore, this book is not only helpful to the SOA beginner, but also provides new insight and ideas to professionals.”</p><p><em>- Philipp Offermann, Research Scientist, Technische Universität Berlin, Germany</em></p><p>“<em>SOA Design Patterns</em> is an extraordinary contribution to SOA best practices! Once again, Thomas has created an indispensable resource for any person or organization interested in or actively engaged in the practice of Service Oriented Architecture. Using case studies based on three very different business models, Thomas guides the reader through the process of selecting appropriate implementation patterns to ensure a flexible, well-performing, and secure SOA ecosystem.”</p><p><em>- Victor Brown, Managing Partner and Principal Consultant,</em></p><p><em>Cypress Management Group Corporation</em></p><p>In cooperation with experts and practitioners throughout the SOA community, best-selling author Thomas Erl brings together the de facto catalog of design patterns for SOA and service-orientation. More than three years in development and subjected to numerous industry reviews, the 85 patterns in this full-color book provide the most successful and proven design techniques to overcoming the most common and critical problems to achieving modern-day SOA. Through numerous examples, individually documented pattern profiles, and over 400 color illustrations, this book provides in-depth coverage of: • Patterns for the design, implementation, and governance of service inventories–collections of services representing individual service portfolios that can be independently modeled, designed, and evolved. • Patterns specific to service-level architecture which pertain to a wide range of design areas, including contract design, security, legacy encapsulation, reliability, scalability, and a variety of implementation and governance issues. • Service composition patterns that address the many aspects associated with combining services into aggregate distributed solutions, including topics such as runtime messaging and message design, inter-service security controls, and transformation. • Compound patterns (such as Enterprise Service Bus and Orchestration) and recommended pattern application sequences that establish foundational processes. The book begins by establishing SOA types that are referenced throughout the patterns and then form the basis of a final chapter that discusses the architectural impact of service-oriented computing in general. These chapters bookend the pattern catalog to provide a clear link between SOA design patterns, the strategic goals of service-oriented computing, different SOA types, and the service-orientation design paradigm.</p><p>This book series is further supported by a series of resources sites, including <strong>soabooks.com, soaspecs.com, soapatterns.org, soamag.com,</strong> and <strong>soaposters.com.</strong></p></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>Responsive design isn’t merely another technique. It’s a way\nof building sites and applications that requires a fundamental\nshift in approach. From planning to development, every aspect of\nbuilding for the web is affected. This video course starts by\nexplaining the three primary components of responsive design: fluid\nlayouts, media queries and responsive images. With a firm\nunderstanding of those in place, we branch out and explore how\nresponsive design impacts workflow, how to maintain the hierarchy\nof content, how to use feature detection to enhance the experience,\nhow to organize your JavaScript to play along nicely, how to\noptimize responsive sites for performance—and more. Course\nobjectives and goals: This course arms its students with the skills\nnecessary to start building quality responsive sites today. By the\nend of the course, students will know how to: Use fluid layouts,\nmedia queries and fluid images to create responsive layouts Use\nresponsive image techniques to serve appropriately sized images to\na variety of devices Ensure that the hierarchy of content is\npreserved across screen sizes Enhance the functionality of your\nsite with feature detection Improve the performance of your site\nand avoid becoming another example of \"fat\" responsive design\nAdjust your existing workflow to better accommodate multi-device\ndesign and development Determine what devices to test on and how\nCourse Requirements: To get the most out of this course, you'll\nneed your favorite code editor and ideally a couple of devices to\ntest on. If you don't have a tablet and phone for testing, then\nyou'll want to get a hold of a simulator or use one of the many\ndevice testing services online to follow along. You could,\ntheoretically, follow along by resizing your browser, but I highly\nrecommend against it—you'll get much more out of it by seeing how\nthings behave on different devices.

    "description": "<span><span><p>“While you’re reading Neuro Web Design, you’ll\nprobably find yourself thinking ‘I already knew\nthat…’ a lot. But when you’re finished,\nyou’ll discover that your ability to create effective web\nsites has mysteriously improved. A brilliant idea for a book, and\nvery nicely done.”<br/>\n— Steve Krug, author of Don’t Make Me Think!<br/>\nA Common Sense Approach to Web Usability<br/><br/>\nWhy do people decide to buy a product online? Register at your Web\nsite? Trust the information you provide? Neuro Web Design applies\nthe research on motivation, decision making, and neuroscience to\nthe design of Web sites. You will learn the unconscious reasons for\npeople’s actions, how emotions affect decisions, and how to\napply the principles of persuasion to design Web sites that\nencourage users to click.<br/><br/>\nNeuro Web Design employs “neuro-marketing” concepts,\nwhich are at the intersection of psychology and user experience.\nIt’s scientific, yet you’ll find it accessible, easy to\nread, and easy to understand. By applying the concepts and examples\nin this book, you’ll be able to dramatically increase the\neffectiveness and conversion rates of your own Web site.<br/><br/></p></span></span>",

It also takes the ability to come up with the big ideas that make a desirable product or service, as well as the skill and perseverance to execute on the thousand small ideas that get your design into the hands of users. It requires expertise in project management, user research, and consensus-building. This comprehensive, full-color volume addresses all of these and more with detailed how-to information, real-life examples, and exercises. Topics include assembling a design team, planning and conducting user research, analyzing your data and turning it into personas, using scenarios to drive requirements definition and design, collaborating in design meetings, evaluating and iterating your design, and documenting finished design in a way that works for engineers and stakeholders alike.</p></span></span></span></span>",

These types of layouts have always been\npossible with tables but offer new design challenges as well as\nopportunities when built with CSS.

They will learn not\nonly how to build a liquid layout from scratch using\nstandards-compliant and cross-browser compatible (X)HTML and CSS,\nbut will also learn how to design and slice their graphic comps in\na way that makes flexible design achievable. This book will show\ndesigners that flexible layouts do not have to be visually boring\nor difficult to build when planned and built correctly. Even those\nwho do not intend to build liquid layouts can use the concepts and\ntechniques taught in this book to improve their fixed-width CSS\ndesigns, because they will learn how to design for the inherent\nflexibility of the web medium, instead of the rigid qualities of\nprint media or table grid-based layouts.</p></span></span>",

Since JavaScript is the language of the web, building APIs using Node.js provides a seamless development experience on both the front end and the back end.</p><p>This video course gives you an overview of a RESTful API and goes through the logical steps of building one. It explores three different APIs, focusing on their similarities and differences to effectively implement one.</p><p>We’ll start off by defining APIs, showing how they can be built on top of HTTP, and listing the properties that make an API RESTful. We will develop Twitter Notes, a web application that lets its users leave notes for their Twitter friends. We will use Twitter’s API to implement a login flow and then design a web API. In addition to using Twitter’s API, we will take a closer look at two other real-world APIs—Facebook API and GitHub API. Finally, we’ll end up honing some best practices to keep the APIs secure, maintainable, and performant.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will have a good grasp of APIs, HTTP, REST, OAuth 1.0a, API testing, and API security. Since the course explores three different REST APIs, you will reach a level where you will be comfortable using any RESTful API, even if it does not have an SDK.</p></span></span>",

To create a\nsuccessful web product that’s as large as Etsy, Facebook,\nTwitter, or Pinterest–or even as small as a tiny\napp–you need to know more than just HTML and CSS. You need to\nunderstand how to create meaningful online experiences so that\nusers want to come back again and again.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, you have to stop thinking like a web designer or a\nvisual designer or a UX designer or an interaction designer and\nstart thinking like a product designer.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this breakthrough introduction to modern product design, Etsy\nCreative Director Randy Hunt explains the skills, processes, types\nof tools, and recommended workflows for creating world-class web\nproducts. After reading this book, you’ll have a complete\nunderstanding of what product design really is and you’ll be\nequipped with the best practices necessary for building your own\nsuccessful online products.<br/></p><p><br/></p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Web services have been used for many years.\nIn this time, developers and architects have encountered a number\nof recurring design challenges related to their usage, and have\nlearned that certain service design approaches work better than\nothers to solve certain problems.</p><p>In <b><em><b>Service Design\nPatterns,</b></em></b> Rob Daigneau codifies proven design solutions\nfor web services that follow the REST architectural style or\nleverage the SOAP/WSDL specifications. This catalogue identifies\nthe fundamental topics in web service design and lists the common\ndesign patterns for each topic. All patterns identify the context\nin which they may be used, explain the constituent design elements,\nand explore the relative strengths and trade-offs. Code examples\nare provided to help you better understand how the patterns work\nbut are kept general so that you can see how the solutions may be\napplied to disparate technologies that will inevitably change in\nthe years to come.</p><p>This book will help readers answer the\nfollowing questions:</p><ul><li><p>\nHow do you create a web service API, what\nare the common API styles, and when should a particular style be\nused?\n</p></li><li><p>\nHow can clients and web services\ncommunicate, and what are the foundations for creating complex\nconversations in which multiple parties exchange data over extended\nperiods of time?\n</p></li><li><p>\nWhat are the options for implementing web\nservice logic, and when should a particular approach be used?\n</p></li><li><p>\nHow can clients become less coupled to the\nunderlying systems used by a service?\n</p></li><li><p>\nHow can information about a web service be\ndiscovered?\n</p></li><li><p>\nHow can generic functions like\nauthentication, validation, caching, and logging be supported on\nthe client or service?\n</p></li><li><p>\nWhat changes to a service cause clients to\nbreak?\n</p></li><li><p>\nWhat are the common ways to version a\nservice? How can web services be designed to support the continuing\nevolution of business logic without forcing clients to constantly\nupgrade? \n</p></li></ul><p>This book is an invaluable resource for\nenterprise architects, solution architects, and developers who use\nweb services to create enterprise IT applications, commercial or\nopen source products, and Software as a Service (SaaS) products\nthat leverage emerging Cloud platforms.</p></span>",

    "title": "Information Architecture for the World Wide Web",
    "description": "<span><span><p>\nSome web sites \"work\" and some don't. Good web site consultants\nknow that you can't just jump in and start writing HTML, the same\nway you can't build a house by just pouring a foundation and\nputting up some walls. You need to know who will be using the site,\nand what they'll be using it for. You need some idea of what you'd\nlike to draw their attention to during their visit. Overall, you\nneed a strong, cohesive vision for the site that makes it both\ndistinctive and usable. <em>Information Architecture for the World\nWide Web</em> is about applying the principles of architecture and\nlibrary science to web site design. Each web site is like a public\nbuilding, available for tourists and regulars alike to breeze\nthrough at their leisure. The job of the architect is to set up the\nframework for the site to make it comfortable and inviting for\npeople to visit, relax in, and perhaps even return to someday. Most\nbooks on web development concentrate either on the aesthetics or\nthe mechanics of the site. This book is about the framework that\nholds the two together. With this book, you learn how to design web\nsites and intranets that support growth, management, and ease of\nuse. Special attention is given to:\n</p><ul><li><p>The process behind architecting a large, complex site</p></li><li><p>Web site hierarchy design and organization</p></li></ul><p><em>Information Architecture for the World Wide Web</em> is for\nwebmasters, designers, and anyone else involved in building a web\nsite. It's for novice web designers who, from the start, want to\navoid the traps that result in poorly designed sites. It's for\nexperienced web designers who have already created sites but\nrealize that something \"is missing\" from their sites and want to\nimprove them. It's for programmers and administrators who are\ncomfortable with HTML, CGI, and Java but want to understand how to\norganize their web pages into a cohesive site. The authors are two\nof the principals of Argus Associates, a web consulting firm. At\nArgus, they have created information architectures for web sites\nand intranets of some of the largest companies in the United\nStates, including Chrysler Corporation, Barron's, and Dow Chemical.\n</p></span></span>",

So much so, in fact, that the 12-month\ndesign cycles cited in the last edition have shrunk to 6 or even 3\nmonths today. Which is why, more than ever, you need a smart,\npractical guide that demonstrates how to plan, budget, organize,\nand manage your Web redesign - or even you initial design -\nprojects from conceptualization to launch. This volume delivers! In\nthese pages Web designer extraordinaire <b>Kelly Goto</b> and\ncoauthor <b>Emily Cotler</b> have distilled their real-world\nexperience into a sound approach to Web redesign workflow that is\nas much about business priorities as it is about good design. By\nfocusing on where these priorities intersect, <b>Kelly and\nEmily</b> get straight to the heart of the matter. Each chapter\nincludes a case study that illustrates a key step in the process,\nand you'll find a plethora of forms, checklists, and worksheets\nthat help you put knowledge into action.This is an AIGA Design\nPress book published under Peachpit's New Riders imprint in\npartnership with AIGA.<br/></p></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p><b>The Ultimate Guide for Designing and Governing Web Service Contracts</b></p><p>For Web services to succeed as part of SOA, they require balanced, effective technical contracts that enable services to be evolved and repeatedly reused for years to come. Now, a team of industry experts presents the first end-to-end guide to designing and governing Web service contracts. Writing for developers, architects, governance specialists, and other IT professionals, the authors cover the following areas:</p><p><i>Understanding Web Service Contract Technologies</i></p><p>Initial chapters and ongoing supplementary content help even the most inexperienced professional get up to speed on how all of the different technologies and design considerations relate to the creation of Web service contracts. For example, a visual anatomy of a Web service contract documented from logical and physical perspectives is provided, along with a chapter dedicated to describing namespaces in plain English. The book is further equipped with numerous case study examples and many illustrations.</p><p><i>Fundamental and Advanced WSDL</i></p><p>Tutorial coverage of WSDL 1.1 and 2.0 and detailed descriptions of their differences is followed by numerous advanced WSDL topics and design techniques, including extreme loose coupling, modularization options, use of extensibility elements, asynchrony, message dispatch, service instance identification, non-SOAP HTTP binding, and WS-BPEL extensions. Also explained is how WSDL definitions are shaped by key SOA design patterns.</p><p><i>Fundamental and Advanced XML Schema</i></p><p>XML Schema basics are covered within the context of Web services and SOA, after which advanced XML Schema chapters delve into a variety of specialized message design considerations and techniques, including the use of wildcards, reusability of schemas and schema fragments, type inheritance and composition, CRUD-style message design, and combining industry and custom schemas.</p><p><i>Fundamental and Advanced WS-Policy</i></p><p>Topics, such as Policy Expression Structure, Composite Policies, Operator Composition Rules, and Policy Attachment establish a foundation upon which more advanced topics, such as policy reusability and centralization, nested, parameterized, and ignorable assertions are covered, along with an exploration of creating concurrent policy-enabled contracts and designing custom policy assertions and vocabularies.</p><p><i>Fundamental Message Design with SOAP</i></p><p>A broad range of message design-related topics are covered, including SOAP message structures, SOAP nodes and roles, SOAP faults, designing custom SOAP headers and working with industry-standard SOAP headers.</p><p><i>Advanced Message Design with WS-Addressing</i></p><p>The art of message design is taken to a new level with in-depth descriptions of WS-Addressing endpoint references (EPRs) and MAP headers and an exploration of how they are applied via SOA design patterns. Also covered are WSDL binding considerations, related MEP rules, WS-Addressing policy assertions, and detailed coverage of how WS-Addressing relates to SOAP Action values.</p><p><i>Advanced Message Design with MTOM, and SwA</i></p><p>Developing SOAP messages capable of transporting large documents or binary content is explored with a documentation of the MTOM packaging and serialization framework (including MTOM-related policy assertions), together with the SOAP with Attachments (SwA) standard and the related WS-I Attachments Profile.</p><p><i>Versioning Techniques and Strategies</i></p><p>Fundamental versioning theory starts off a series of chapters that dive into a variety of versioning techniques based on proven SOA design patterns including backward and forward compatibility, version identification strategies, service termination, policy versioning, validation by projection, concurrency control, partial understanding, and versioning with and without wildcards.</p><p><i>Web Service Contracts and SOA</i></p><p>The constant focus of this book is on the design and versioning of Web service contracts in support of SOA and service-orientation. Relevant SOA design principles and design patterns are periodically discussed to demonstrate how specific Web service technologies can be applied and further optimized. Furthermore, several of the advanced chapters provide expert techniques for designing Web service contracts while taking SOA governance considerations into account.</p><p><b>About the Web Sites</b></p><p><b><a href=\"http://www.soabooks.com\">www.soabooks.com</a></b> supplements this book with a variety of resources, including a diagram symbol legend, glossary, supplementary articles, and source code available for download.</p><p><b><a href=\"http://www.soaspecs.com\">www.soaspecs.com</a></b> provides further support by establishing a descriptive portal to XML and Web services specifications referenced in all of Erl’s Service-Oriented Architecture books.</p><p>Foreword</p><p>Preface</p><p>Chapter 1: Introduction</p><p>Chapter 2: Case Study Background</p><p><i>Part I: Fundamental Service Contract Design</i></p><p>Chapter 3: SOA Fundamentals and Web Service Contracts</p><p>Chapter 4: Anatomy of a Web Service Contract</p><p>Chapter 5: A Plain English Guide to Namespaces</p><p>Chapter 6: Fundamental XML Schema: Types and Message Structure Basics</p><p>Chapter 7: Fundamental WSDL Part I: Abstract Description Design</p><p>Chapter 8: Fundamental WSDL Part II: Concrete Description Design</p><p>Chapter 9: Fundamental WSDL 2.0: New Features, and Design Options</p><p>Chapter 10: Fundamental WS-Policy: Expression, Assertion, and Attachment</p><p>Chapter 11: Fundamental Message Design: SOAP Envelope Structure, and Header Block Processing</p><p><i>Part II: Advanced Service Contract Design</i></p><p>Chapter 12: Advanced XML Schema Part I: Message Flexibility, and Type Inheritance and Composition</p><p>Chapter 13: Advanced XML Schema Part II: Reusability, Derived Types, and Relational Design</p><p>Chapter 14: Advanced WSDL Part I: Modularization, Extensibility, MEPs, and Asynchrony</p><p>Chapter 15: Advanced WSDL Part II: Message Dispatch, Service Instance Identification, and Non-SOAP HTTP Binding</p><p>Chapter 16: Advanced WS-Policy Part I: Policy Centralization and Nested, Parameterized, and Ignorable Assertions</p><p>Chapter 17: Advanced WS-Policy Part II: Custom Policy Assertion Design, Runtime Representation, and Compatibility</p><p>Chapter 18: Advanced Message Design Part I: WS-Addressing Vocabularies</p><p>Chapter 19: Advanced Message Design Part II: WS-Addressing Rules and Design Techniques</p><p><i>Part III: Service Contract Versioning</i></p><p>Chapter 20: Versioning Fundamentals</p><p>Chapter 21: Versioning WSDL Definitions</p><p>Chapter 22: Versioning Message Schemas</p><p>Chapter 23: Advanced Versioning</p><p><i>Part IV: Appendices</i></p><p>Appendix A: Case Study Conclusion</p><p>Appendix B: A Comparison of Web Services and REST Services</p><p>Appendix C: How Technology Standards are Developed</p><p>Appendix D: Alphabetical Pseudo Schema Reference</p><p>Appendix E: SOA Design Patterns Related to This Book</p></div></span>",

When used correctly, they meet crucial software requirements with ease and reduce costs. This book will uncover effective ways to use design patterns and demonstrate their implementation with executable code specific to both C# and .NET Core.\n</p><p>Hands-On Design Patterns with C# and .NET Core begins with an overview of object-oriented programming (OOP) and SOLID principles. It provides an in-depth explanation of the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns, including creational, structural, and behavioral. The book then takes you through functional, reactive, and concurrent patterns, helping you write better code with streams, threads, and coroutines. Toward the end of the book, you’ll learn about the latest trends in architecture, exploring design patterns for microservices, serverless, and cloud native applications. You’ll even understand the considerations that need to be taken into account when choosing between different architectures such as microservices and MVC.\n</p><p>By the end of the book, you will be able to write efficient and clear code and be comfortable working on scalable and maintainable projects of any size.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Make your code more flexible by applying SOLID principles\n</li><li>Follow the test-driven development (TDD) approach in your .NET Core projects\n</li><li>Get to grips with efficient database migration, data persistence, and testing techniques\n</li><li>Convert a console application to a web application using the right MVP\n</li><li>Write asynchronous, multithreaded, and parallel code\n</li><li>Implement MVVM and work with RxJS and AngularJS to deal with changes in databases\n</li><li>Explore the features of microservices, serverless programming, and cloud computing</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>If you have a basic understanding of C# and the .NET Core framework, this book will help you write code that is easy to reuse and maintain with the help of proven design patterns that you can implement in your code.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this ebook: You can download the example code files for this ebook on GitHub at the following link: \n\t\t<a href=\"https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Design-Patterns-with-C-and-.NET-Core\">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Design-Patterns-with-C-and-.NET-Core</a>.

This has introduced a new role for developers – Full Stack Developers.However, resources to become a Full Stack Developer are limited and only offer sections or just random technologies that you must learn and combine on your own. So, we introduced this course that compiles all technologies in perfect sync to help developers transition from a simple developer to become a Full Stack Developer. Starting from front-end development, the learner will slowly progress to become to other aspects of development including back-end, database, debugging, version control and other essential technologies that are helpful for a developer.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Microformats have been designed to give additional meaning to\nsimple, widely-published types of data on the web. They add another\nlayer of functionality to Web pages. You can use them to add\nstructure and meaning to contact information about people and\nplaces, and to calendar information. You can mark up reviews of\nevents or the relationships between people. You can even use them\nfor blog posts and syndicated content.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this video, author and CSS guru Andy Clarke shows how to\nimplement these simple, structured formats in HTML. He takes a\ndesign-based approach and provides a number of visual examples so\nthat those with a less technical background can get started using\nmicroformats in their designs right away. He demonstrates these\nconcepts using examples from a fictitious social networking site.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is an online streaming video, not a download.

    "description": "<span><p>User experience design teams often suffer from a decentralized,\nblank canvas approach to creating and documenting a design solution\nfor each new project. As teams repeatedly reinvent screen designs,\ninconsistency results, and IT teams scramble to pick up the pieces.\nPattern libraries only go so far, suggesting general solutions to\ncommon problems instead of offering concrete, specific design\ntreatments. At times, documented solutions turn into a costly mess\nof unclear expectations, unrealistic goals, and abandoned\nwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnter components, each of which represents a chunk of a Web page.\nDesigners can produce wireframes, mockups, or markup far more\nefficiently reusing components based on an established design\nsystem. Rather than limit innovation, components enable designers\nto render solved design frameworks quickly and to focus on the\nproblem at hand, drastically improving the quality and rate of\nproduction. In addition, teams develop a deeper baseline for\ncollaboration, a platform for governance, and a structure for\nuseful and predictable documentation.<br/>\n <br/>\nThis book defines the role of components and why they matter, maps\nout how to organize and build a component library, discusses how to\nuse components in practice, and teaches a process for documenting\nand maintaining components.<br/></p></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>Are you still designing web sites like it's 1999? If so, you're in for a surprise. Since the last edition of this book appeared five years ago, there has been a major climate change with regard to web standards.  Designers are no longer using (X)HTML as a design tool, but as a means of defining the meaning and structure of content. Cascading Style Sheets are no longer just something interesting to tinker with, but rather a reliable method for handling all matters of presentation, from fonts and colors to the layout of the entire page. In fact, following the standards is now a mandate of professional web design.</p><p>Our popular reference, <i>Web Design in a Nutshell</i>, is one of the first books to capture this new web landscape with an edition that's been completely rewritten and expanded to reflect the state of the art. In addition to being an authoritative reference for (X)HTML and Cascading Style Sheets, this book also provides an overview of the unique requirements of designing for the Web and gets to the nitty-gritty of JavaScript and DOM Scripting, web graphics optimization, and multimedia production. It is an indispensable tool for web designers and developers of all levels.</p><p>The third edition covers these contemporary web design topics:</p><ul><li>Structural layer: HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 (9 chapters), including an alphabetical reference of all elements, attributes and character entities</li><li>Presentation layer: Ten all-new chapters on Cascading Style Sheets, Level 2.1, including an alphabetical reference of all properties and values.</li><li>Behavior layer: JavaScript and scripting with the Document Object Model (DOM)</li><li>Web environment: New web standards, browsers, display devices, accessibility, and internationalization</li><li>Web graphics optimization: Producing lean and mean GIF, JPEG, PNG, and animated GIFs</li><li>Multimedia: Web audio, video, Flash, and PDF</li></ul><p>Organized so that readers can find answers quickly, <i>Web Design in a Nutshell</i>, Third Edition helps experienced designers come up to speed quickly on standards-based web design, and serves as a quick reference for those already familiar with the new standards and technology.</p><p>There are many books for web designers, but none that address such a wide variety of topics. Find out why nearly half a million buyers have made this the most popular web design book available.</p></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p>You want to make your websites more dynamic by adding a feedback form, creating a private area where members can upload images that are automatically resized, or perhaps storing all your content in a database. The problem is, you're not a programmer and the thought of writing code sends a chill up your spine. Or maybe you've dabbled a bit in PHP and MySQL, but you can't get past baby steps. If this describes you, then you've just found the right book.</p><p>PHP and the MySQL database are deservedly the most popular combination for creating dynamic websites. They're free, easy to use, and provided by many web hosting companies in their standard packages. Unfortunately, most PHP books either expect you to be an expert already or force you to go through endless exercises of little practical value. In contrast, this book gives you real value right away through a series of practical examples that you can incorporate directly into your sites, optimizing performance and adding functionality such as file uploading, email feedback forms, image galleries, content management systems, and much more. Each solution is created with not only functionality in mind, but also visual design.</p><p>But this book doesn't just provide a collection of ready-made scripts: each PHP solution builds on what's gone before, teaching you the basics of PHP and database design quickly and painlessly. By the end of the book, you'll have the confidence to start writing your own scripts, or if you prefer to leave that task to others, to adapt existing scripts to your own requirements.</p><p>Right from the start, you're shown how easy it is to protect your sites by adopting secure coding practices. The book has been written with an eye on forward and backward compatibility recommending PHP 5 techniques, but providing alternative solutions for servers still running PHP 4.3. All database examples demonstrate how to use the original MySQL extension, MySQL Improved, or the PHP Data Objects (PDO) introduced in PHP 5.1, letting you choose the most suitable option for your setup.</p></span></span></span>",

Familiarity with basic JavaScript programming techniques is required. No prior experience with Node.JS or Express.js is required.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Install, develop, and test your own Node.js user modules</li><li>Comprehend the differences between an HTTP and a RESTful application</li><li>Optimize RESTful service URI routing with best practices</li><li>Eliminate third-party dependencies in your tests with mocking</li><li>Learn about NoSQL data stores and integrate MongoDB in your Node.js application with Mongoose</li><li>Secure your services with NoSQL database integration within Node.js applications</li><li>Enrich your development skills to create scalable, server-side, RESTful applications based on the Node.js platform</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>In this era of cloud computing, every data provisioning solution is built in a scalable and fail-safe way. Thus, when building RESTful services, the right choice for the underlying platform is vital. Node.js, with its asynchronous, event-driven architecture, is exactly the right choice to build RESTful APIs.</p><p>This book will help you enrich your development skills to create scalable, server-side, RESTful applications based on the Node.js platform.</p><p>Starting with the fundamentals of REST, you will understand why RESTful web services are better data provisioning solution than other technologies. You will start setting up a development environment by installing Node.js, Express.js, and other modules. Next, you will write a simple HTTP request handler and create and test Node.js modules using automated tests and mock objects. You will then have to choose the most appropriate data storage type, having options between a key/value or document data store, and also you will implement automated tests for it. This module will evolve chapter by chapter until it turns into a full-fledged and secure Restful service.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>Create state of the art RESTful API solutions leveraging Node.JS 4.x.</p></span>",

You do not have to be an expert in Django or Python. No prior knowledge of patterns is expected for reading this book but it would be helpful.</p><b>What You Will Learn</b><ul><li>Make use of common design patterns to help you write better code</li><li>Implement best practices and idioms in this rapidly evolving framework</li><li>Deal with legacy code and debugging</li><li>Use asynchronous tools such as Celery, Channels, and asyncio</li><li>Use patterns while designing API interfaces with the Django REST Framework</li><li>Reduce the maintenance burden with well-tested, cleaner code</li><li>Host, deploy, and secure your Django projects</li></ul><b>In Detail</b><p>Building secure and maintainable web applications requires comprehensive knowledge. The second edition of this book not only sheds light on Django, but also encapsulates years of experience in the form of design patterns and best practices. Rather than sticking to GoF design patterns, the book looks at higher-level patterns. Using the latest version of Django and Python, you'll learn about Channels and asyncio while building a solid conceptual background. The book compares design choices to help you make everyday decisions faster in a rapidly changing environment.</p><p>You'll first learn about various architectural patterns, many of which are used to build Django.

This guide tosses that notion into the trash bin.<br/><br/><em>Painting the Web</em> is the first comprehensive book on web graphics to come along in years, and author Shelley Powers demonstrates how readers of any level can take advantage of the graphics and animation capabilities built into today's powerful browsers. She covers GIFs, JPEGs, and PNGs, raster and vector graphics, CSS, Ajax effects, the canvas objects, SVG, geographical applications, and more -- everything that designers (and non-designers) use to literally paint the Web.<br/><br/>More importantly, Shelley's own love of web graphics shines through in every example. Not only can you master the many different techniques, you also can have fun doing it.<br/><br/>Topics in <em>Painting the Web</em> include:<br/><br/></p><ul><li>GIF, JPEG, PNG, lossy versus lossless compression, color management, and optimization</li><li>Photo workflow, from camera to web page, including a review of photo editors, workflow tools, and RAW photo utilities</li><li>Tricks for best displaying your photos online</li><li>Non-photographic raster images (icons and logos), with step-by-step tutorials for creating popular \"Web 2.0\" effects like reflection, shiny buttons, inlays, and shadows</li><li>Vector graphics</li><li>An SVG tutorial, with examples of all the major components</li><li>Tips and tricks for using CSS</li><li>Interactive effects with Ajax such as accordions and fades</li><li>The canvas object implemented in most browsers</li><li>Geographical applications such as Google Maps and Yahoo Maps, with programming and non-programming examples</li><li>Visual effects such as forms and data displays in table or graphics</li><li>Web design for the non-designer</li></ul><p>Graphics are not essential to the web experience, but they do make the difference between a site that's functional and one that's lively, compelling, and exciting.

    "title": "PHP 7 Solutions: Dynamic Web Design Made Easy",
    "description": "<span><p>Make your websites more dynamic by adding a feedback form, creating a private area where members can upload images that are automatically resized, or perhaps storing all your content in a database. David Powers has updated his definitive book to incorporate the latest techniques and changes to PHP, including the arrival of PHP 7. New features include the spaceship and null coalesce operators, generators, using array shorthand syntax for list(), array dereferencing, and array unpacking with the splat operator.</p>The problem is, you're not a programmer and the thought of writing code sends a chill up your spine. Or maybe you've dabbled a bit in PHP and MySQL, but you can't get past baby steps. If this describes you, then you've just found the right book. PHP and the MySQL database are deservedly the most popular combination for creating dynamic websites. They're free, easy to use, and provided by many web hosting companies in their standard packages. This book also covers MariaDB, a seamless replacement for MySQL that has been adopted on many web servers.<p></p><p>Unfortunately, most PHP books either expect you to be an expert already or force you to go through endless exercises of little practical value. In contrast, this book gives you real value right away through a series of practical examples that you can incorporate directly into your sites, optimizing performance and adding functionality such as file uploading, email feedback forms, image galleries, content management systems, and much more. Each solution is created with not only functionality in mind, but also visual design.</p><p>But this book doesn't just provide a collection of ready-made scripts: each PHP solution builds on what's gone before, teaching you the basics of PHP and database design quickly and painlessly. By the end of the book, you'll have the confidence to start writing your own scripts or—if you prefer to leave that task to others—to adapt existing scripts to your own requirements. Right from the start, you're shown how easy it is to protect your sites by adopting secure coding practices.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><p></p><ul><li>Design and build dynamic PHP-based web sites and applications <br/></li><li>Get started right away through practical examples that you can reuse<br/></li><li></li><li>Incorporate PHP 7 elements including new ways of handling arrays </li><li>Work with the latest PHP 7 techniques, innovations, and best practices<br/></li></ul><p></p><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>Readers should have at least some prior exposure to web development using PHP.  </p><p><br/></p></span>",

It is destined to become a close friend, adopting a permanent place on your desk.</p><p>It starts off by giving a brief introduction to the Internet, and the broad area of web design, before diving straight in to HTML and CSS basics, reusing code, other best practices. It then focuses on all the most important areas of a successful web site—typography, images, navigation, tables, layouts, forms and feedback (including ready made PHP scripts for you to use,) and browser quirks, hacks and bugs. The book is completely up-to-date, covering support of the standards in IE 7 and Firefox 2.</p><p>The last chapter of the book provides several case studies for you to dissect and learn from, including all the most popular web site archetypes—a blog, a store front, a corporate home page, and an online gallery.</p><p>Then the book is rounded off with several detailed reference appendices covering CSS, HTML, Color references, entities, and more, meaning that any details you need to look up are close at hand.</p><ul><li><p>This book will teach you everything you need to know to create professional CSS and HTML web sites</p></li><li><p>Up-to-date, covering support of the standards in IE 7 and Firefox 2</p></li><li><p>Includes practical real world tutorials, essential reference sections, and case studies</p></li></ul></span>",

Its goal is to ensure that a given product is easy to use and the user's experience with the product is intuitive and satisfying. Usability studies are conducted with study participants who are representative of the target users to gather feedback on a user interface. The feedback is then used to refine and improve the user interface.\n</p><p>Remote studies involve fewer logistics, allow participation regardless of location and are quicker and cheaper to execute compared to in person studies, while delivering valuable insights. The users are not inhibited by being in a new environment under observation; they can act naturally in their familiar environment. Remote unmoderated studies additionally have the advantage of being independent of time zones.\n</p><p>This book will teach you how to conduct qualitative remote usability studies, in particular remote moderated and unmoderated studies. Each chapter provides actionable tips on how to use each methodology and how to compensate for the specific nature of each methodology.

    "description": "<span><p>IBM® MessageSight is an appliance-based messaging server\nthat is optimized to address the massive scale requirements of\nmachine-to-machine (m2m) and mobile user scenarios. IBM\nMessageSight makes it easy to connect mobile customers to your\nexisting messaging enterprise system, enabling a substantial number\nof remote clients to be concurrently connected.</p><p>The MQTT protocol is a lightweight messaging protocol that uses\npublish/subscribe architecture to deliver messages over low\nbandwidth or unreliable networks. A publish/subscribe architecture\nworks well for HTML5, native, and hybrid mobile applications by\nremoving the wait time of a request/response model. This creates a\nbetter, richer user experience.</p><p>The MQTT protocol is simple, which results in a client library\nwith a low footprint. MQTT was proposed as an Organization for the\nAdvancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) standard.\nThis book provides information about version 3.1 of the MQTT\nspecification.</p><p>This IBM Redbooks® publication provides information about\nhow IBM MessageSight, in combination with MQTT, facilitates the\nexpansion of enterprise systems to include mobile devices and m2m\ncommunications. This book also outlines how to connect IBM\nMessageSight to an existing infrastructure, either through the use\nof IBM WebSphere® MQ connectivity or the IBM Integration Bus\n(formerly known as WebSphere Message Broker).</p><p>This book describes IBM MessageSight product features and\nfacilities that are relevant to technical personnel, such as system\narchitects, to help them make informed design decisions regarding\nthe integration of the messaging appliance into their enterprise\narchitecture.</p><p>Using a scenario-based approach, you learn how to develop a\nmobile application, and how to integrate IBM MessageSight with\nother IBM products. This publication is intended to be of use to a\nwide-ranging audience.</p></span>",

    "title": "Absolute Value - What Really Influences Customers in the Age of (Nearly) Perfect Information",
    "description": "<span><p>Going against conventional wisdom, <em>Absolute Value</em> reveals what really influences customers today and offers a new framework—the Influence Mix—for thinking about consumer decision making, which should help managers develop more effective marketing strategies.</p><p>How people buy things has changed profoundly—yet the fundamental thinking about consumer decision making and marketing has not. Most marketers still believe that they can shape consumers' perceptions and drive their behaviors. In this provocative book, Stanford professor Itamar Simonson and best-selling author Emanuel Rosen show why current mantras about branding and loyalty are losing their relevance. When consumers base their decisions on reviews from other users, easily accessed expert opinions, price comparison apps, and other emerging technologies, everything changes. Contrary to what we frequently hear, consumers will (on average) make better choices and act more rationally.</p><p>Absolute Value<em> answers the pressing question of what influences customers in </em>this new age. Simonson and Rosen identify the old-school marketing concepts that need to change and explain how a company should design its communication strategy, market research program, and segmentation strategy in the new environment. Filled with deep analysis, case studies, and cutting-edge research, this forward-looking book provides an entirely new way of thinking about marketing.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>In a sweeping vision for the future of\nwork, Neumeier shows that the massive problems of the 21st century\nare largely the consequence of a paradigm shift—a shuddering\ngear-change from the familiar Industrial Age to the unfamiliar\n“Robotic Age,” an era of increasing man-machine\ncollaboration.</p><p>This change is creating the\n“Robot Curve,” an accelerating waterfall of\nobsolescence and opportunity that is currently reshuffling the\nfortunes of workers, companies, and national economies. It\ndemonstrates how the cost and value of a unit of work go down as it\nmoves from creative to skilled to rote, and, finally, to robotic.\nWhile the Robot Curve is dangerous to those with brittle or limited\nskills, it offers unlimited potential to those\nwith <em>metaskills</em>—master skills that enable other\nskills.</p><p>Neumeier believes that the\nmetaskills we need in a post-industrial economy\nare <em>feeling</em> (intuition and\nempathy), <em>seeing</em> (systems\nthinking), <em>dreaming</em> (applied\nimagination), <em>making</em> (design),\nand <em>learning</em> (autodidactics). These are not the\nskills we were taught in school. Yet they’re the skills\nwe’ll need to harness the curve.</p><p>In explaining each of the\nmetaskills, he offers encouragement and concrete advice for\nmastering their intricacies. At the end of the book he lays out\nseven changes that education can make to foster these important\ntalents.</p><p>This is a rich, exciting book\nfor forward-thinking educators, entrepreneurs, designers, artists,\nscientists, and future leaders in every field. It comes illustrated\nwith clear diagrams and a 16-page color photo essay. Those who\nenjoy this book may be interested in its slimmer\ncompanion, <em>The 46 Rules of Genius</em>, also by Marty\nNeumeier.</p><p>\n        </p><p>Things you’ll learn\nin <em>Metaskills</em>:</p><p>- How to stay ahead of the\n“robot curve”</p><p>- How to account for “latency”\nin your predictions</p><p>- The 9 most common traps of systems\nbehavior</p><p>- How to distinguish among 4 types of\noriginality</p><p>- The 3 key steps in generating innovative\nsolutions</p><p>- 6 ways to think like Steve Jobs</p><p>- How to recognize the 3 essential\nqualities of beauty</p><p>- 24 aesthetic tools you can apply to any\nkind of work</p><p>- 10 strategies to trigger breakthrough\nideas</p><p>- Why every team needs an X-shaped\nperson</p><p>- How to overcome the 5 forces arrayed\nagainst simplicity</p><p>- 6 tests for measuring the freshness of a\nconcept  </p><p>- How to deploy the 5 principles of\n“uncluding”</p><p>- The 10 tests for measuring great work</p><p>- How to sell an innovative concept to an\norganization</p><p>- 12 principles for constructing a theory\nof learning</p><p>- How to choose a personal mission for the\nreal world</p><p>- The 4 levels of professional\nachievement</p><p>- 7 steps for revolutionizing education</p><p>From the back cover</p><p>\"Help! A robot ate my job!\" If you haven't\nheard this complaint yet, you will. Today's widespread unemployment\nis not a jobs crisis. It's a <em>talent</em> crisis.\nTechnology is taking every job that doesn't need a high degree of\ncreativity, humanity, or leadership. The solution? Stay on top of\nthe Robot Curve--a constant waterfall of obsolescence and\nopportunity fed by competition and innovation. Neumeier presents\nfive metaskills--feeling, seeing, dreaming, making, and\nlearning--that will accelerate your success in the Robotic Age.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>Human factors and usability issues have traditionally played a limited role in security research and secure systems development. Security experts have largely ignored usability issues--both because they often failed to recognize the importance of human factors and because they lacked the expertise to address them.</p><p>But there is a growing recognition that today's security problems can be solved only by addressing issues of usability and human factors. Increasingly, well-publicized security breaches are attributed to human errors that might have been prevented through more usable software. Indeed, the world's future cyber-security depends upon the deployment of security technology that can be broadly used by untrained computer users.</p><p>Still, many people believe there is an inherent tradeoff between computer security and usability. It's true that a computer without passwords is usable, but not very secure. A computer that makes you authenticate every five minutes with a password and a fresh drop of blood might be very secure, but nobody would use it. Clearly, people need computers, and if they can't use one that's secure, they'll use one that isn't. Unfortunately, unsecured systems aren't usable for long, either. They get hacked, compromised, and otherwise rendered useless.</p><p>There is increasing agreement that we need to design secure systems that people can actually use, but less agreement about how to reach this goal.  <i>Security &amp; Usability</i> is the first book-length work describing the current state of the art in this emerging field. Edited by security experts Dr. Lorrie Faith Cranor and Dr. Simson Garfinkel, and authored by cutting-edge security and human-computerinteraction (HCI) researchers world-wide, this volume is expected to become both a classic reference and an inspiration for future research.</p><p><i>Security &amp; Usability</i> groups 34 essays into six parts:</p><ul><li>Realigning Usability and Security---with careful attention to user-centered design principles, security and usability can be synergistic.</li><li>Authentication Mechanisms-- techniques for identifying and authenticating computer users.</li><li>Secure Systems--how system software can deliver or destroy a secure user experience.</li><li>Privacy and Anonymity Systems--methods for allowing people to control the release of personal information.</li><li>Commercializing Usability: The Vendor Perspective--specific experiences of security and software vendors (e.g.,IBM, Microsoft, Lotus, Firefox, and Zone Labs) in addressing usability.</li><li>The Classics--groundbreaking papers that sparked the field of security and usability.</li></ul><p>This book is expected to start an avalanche of discussion, new ideas, and further advances in this important field.</p></div></span>",

With so many issues involved-usability, brand identity,\ninformation architecture, interaction design-it can seem as if the\nonly way to build a successful site is to spend a fortune on\nspecialists who understand all the details.</p><p><em>The Elements of User Experience</em> cuts through the\ncomplexity of user-centered design for the Web with clear\nexplanations and vivid illustrations that focus on ideas rather\nthan tools or techniques. Jesse James Garrett gives readers the big\npicture of Web user experience development, from strategy and\nrequirements to information architecture and visual design.

Author Victor Yocco, a researcher on\npsychology and communication, introduces the most immediately\nrelevant and applicable psychological concepts, breaks down each\ntheory into easily-digested principles, then shows how they can be\nused to inform better design.</p><p><b>About the Technology</b></p><p>Designers and design team members need to think about more than\njust aesthetics. How do you handle short attention spans. How does\nyour design encourage users to engage, browse, or buy? Fortunately,\nthere are psychological principles that you can use in your design\nto anticipate and benefit from how humans think, behave, and\nreact.</p><p><b>About the Book</b></p><p><em>Design for the Mind: Seven Psychological Principles of\nPersuasive Design</em> teaches you to recognize how websites and\napplications can benefit from an awareness of our innate, natural\nresponses as humans, and to apply the same principles to your own\ndesigns. This approachable book introduces the psychological\nprinciples, deconstructs each into easily digestible concepts, and\nthen shows how you can apply them. The idea is to deepen your\nunderstanding of why people react in the ways they do. After\nreading the book, you’ll be ready to make your work more\npsychologically friendly, engaging, and persuasive.</p><p><b>What’s Inside</b></p><li><p>Making design persuasive</p></li><li><p>Encouraging visitors to take action</p></li><li><p>Creating enduring messages</p></li><li><p>Meeting the needs of both engaged and disengaged visitors</p></li><li><p>Becoming a strategic influencer</p></li><li><p>Applying theory, with case studies and real-world examples</p></li><p><b>About the Reader</b></p><p>This book is for web and UX designers and developers as well as\nanyone involved in customer-facing digital products.</p><p><b>About the Author</b></p><p>Victor Yocco, PhD, is a research director at a\nPhiladelphia-based digital design firm. He received his PhD from\nThe Ohio State University, where his research focused on psychology\nand communication in informal learning settings.

Knowledge of these design patterns helps developers and professionals to craft software solutions of any scale.</p><p>ASP.NET Core 5 Design Patterns starts by exploring basic design patterns, architectural principles, dependency injection, and other ASP.NET Core mechanisms. You'll explore the component scale as you discover patterns oriented toward small chunks of the software, and then move to application-scale patterns and techniques to understand higher-level patterns and how to structure the application as a whole. The book covers a range of significant GoF (Gangs of Four) design patterns such as strategy, singleton, decorator, facade, and composite. The chapters are organized based on scale and topics, allowing you to start small and build on a strong base, the same way that you would develop a program. With the help of use cases, the book will show you how to combine design patterns to display alternate usage and help you feel comfortable working with a variety of design patterns. Finally, you'll advance to the client side to connect the dots and make ASP.NET Core a viable full-stack alternative.</p><p>By the end of the book, you'll be able to mix and match design patterns and have learned how to think about architecture and how it works.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Apply the SOLID principles for building flexible and maintainable software</li><li>Get to grips with .NET 5 dependency injection</li><li>Work with GoF design patterns such as strategy, decorator, and composite</li><li>Explore the MVC patterns for designing web APIs and web applications using Razor</li><li>Discover layering techniques and tenets of clean architecture</li><li>Become familiar with CQRS and vertical slice architecture as an alternative to layering</li><li>Understand microservices, what they are, and what they are not</li><li>Build ASP.NET UI from server-side to client-side Blazor</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This design patterns book is for intermediate-level software and web developers with some knowledge of .NET who want to write flexible, maintainable, and robust code for building scalable web applications. Knowledge of C# programming and an understanding of web concepts like HTTP is necessary.</p></span>",

But they don't need to\nlearn coding, design, programming, or scripting anymore. They need\nto know where to go to get the tools they actually need, and how to\nput it all together. Here, Rafael \"RC\" Concepcion provides what so\nmany photographers need as he lays out a step-by-step plan for\nexactly how to do it.<br/>\n\t\t\t<br/>\nBeginning with domain names and hosting services, RC quickly\nprogresses to how to prepare images for the Web and uploading\ngalleries. He also covers branding for the site--logos, identities,\nand messaging. RC then addresses the importance of blogging, and\nlaunches into the installation of a Wordpress blog and how to\ncustomize it for a photographer's needs with a touch of HTML and a\nhost of plug-ins. RC rounds it all out as he covers social media,\nand the importance of sites like Twitter and Facebook to round out\nthe photographer's web presence. Finally--knowing a website with\nimages just isn't enough--he covers printing from sites like Mpix\nand Artistic Photo Canvas.<br/>\n\t\t\t<br/>\nFor any photographer who is ready to make the next move in either\ntheir hobby or their career, to become and look truly\nprofessional--going beyond posting their images to Flickr--this is\nan essential book to get them up and running.<br/></p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Redesign your static website into a modern, fully responsive website. As the usage of mobile devices of all shapes and sizes increases exponentially every year, and dominates the manner in which many users access the web, it is now imperative for any business to have a responsive website that adapts seamlessly to any screen size and resolution — a change that will impact not only your designs but the way you build your site.</p><p><i>Moving to Responsive Web Design</i> shows you how to convert fixed grids, previously built on absolute units such as pixels, into fluid ones, based on relative units such as percentages or ems. You will also learn to plan how your designs and patterns will adapt across various breakpoints, and how to approach the challenge of responsive images.</p><p>The prospect of converting an existing site into responsive design, when you don't have all the time in the world and your resources are already outstretched, can be daunting, but with this book and the right tools you can tame the scope of the project from the start and find the time for you and your team to work on making your site enjoyable on any device. <i>Moving to Responsive Web Design</i> is full of ideas and examples of how you can more easily plan, design, develop, and release, your responsively redesigned site.</p><ul><li><p>Provides ways of finding time in your hectic schedule to complete a project that is truly important</p></li><li><p>Helps you to scope a responsive redesign project so it's achievable with the resources you have available</p></li><li><p>Provides examples of how other teams have solved some of the most common problems</p></li></ul><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li><p>Find the time in your busy schedule to redesign your site.</p></li><li><p>Engage the entire team in the plan, design and development process.</p></li><li><p>Use your resources in clever and efficient ways.</p></li><li><p>Focus on reusability to save your team time and money.</p></li><li><p>Release your first fully responsive site.</p></li></ul><p><b>Who This Book is For</b></p><p>Busy designers, and developers who want to convert an existing site to responsive design and don't have all the time in the world. It's for teams who know that the move to having a responsive site is the right one, but are struggling to find the time and resources to fit such an expansive project into their already overflowing schedules.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Make your websites more dynamic by adding a feedback form, creating a private area where members can upload images that are automatically resized, or storing all your content in a database. <b>David Powers</b> has updated his definitive book to incorporate the latest techniques and changes to PHP with the arrival of PHP 8. New features include named attributes, constructor property promotion, the stricter and more concise match expression, union types, and more.​</p><p>The problem is, you're not a programmer and the thought of writing code sends a chill up your spine. Or maybe you've dabbled a bit in PHP and MySQL, but you can't get past baby steps. If this describes you, then you've just found the right book. PHP powers four out of every five websites that use a server-side language. In combination with the MySQL database it’s ideal for creating dynamic websites. PHP and MySQL are free, easy to use, and provided by many web hosting companies in their standard packages. This book also covers MariaDB, a seamless replacement for MySQL that has been adopted on many web servers.</p><p>Unfortunately, most PHP books either expect you to be an expert already or force you to go through endless exercises of little practical value. In contrast, this book gives you real value right away through a series of practical examples that you can incorporate directly into your sites, optimizing performance and adding functionality such as file uploading, email feedback forms, image galleries, content management systems, and much more. Each solution is created with not only functionality in mind, but also visual design. </p><p>But this book doesn't just provide a collection of ready-made scripts: each PHP solution builds on what's gone before, teaching you the basics of PHP and database design quickly and painlessly. You’ll learn how to optimize your code using object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques. By the end of the book, you'll have the confidence to start writing your own scripts or—if you prefer to leave that task to others—to adapt existing scripts to your own requirements. Right from the start, you're shown how easy it is to protect your sites by adopting secure coding practices.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Design and build dynamic      PHP-based web sites and applications </li><li>Get started right away through      practical examples that you can reuse</li><li>Incorporate PHP 8 elements      including named attributes, constructor property promotion, and union      types</li><li>Understand the subtle, but      important differences between switch and match</li><li>Work with the latest PHP 8 techniques,      innovations, and best practices</li></ul><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>Readers should ideally have some prior exposure to web development using PHP. </p><p></p></span>",

With mobile internet usage still rising, and tablets changing internet consumption habits, you need to know how to build websites that will just 'work', regardless of the devices used to access them. This second edition of Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS3 explains all the key approaches necessary to create and maintain a modern responsive design.</p><p>The changing way in which we access the web means that there has never been a greater range of screen sizes and associated user experiences to consider.

    "description": "<span><span><p>For a couple of decades now, designers have used Photoshop to\nmock up Web page designs. However, that work generally results in a\nstatic graphic of the page, which has to be translated by a\ndeveloper into the components of a Web page: HTML files and\nWeb-compatible image files.</p><p>Our multi-device world has shown us that this approach to web\ndesign, including full-page comps done in Photoshop, is\nincreasingly problematic. Modern web designers are adopting a new\napproach: creating flexible web pages whose layout can adapt to\nsuit the screen on which they are displayed. This is\n“Responsive Web Design” [RWD].</p><p>Until now, books on designing responsive Web sites have focused\non HTML and CSS – in other words, they've been very\ncode-centric, and visual creativity seems to take a back seat.</p><p>This new book is aimed at the visual Web designer who’s\naccustomed to working in Photoshop. Adobe Photoshop CC contains\nmany new features that help streamline the process of converting a\nstatic page design to a set of components for a responsive web\npage.</p><p>Dan Rose is one of the best-known advocates of this new way of\nworking in Photoshop. He’s observed that only a few people\nare talking about Photoshop for RWD constructively, yet a majority\n(63% as of his last informal poll) of web designers are using\nPhotoshop for more than simple asset creation. This transition is a\npain point for many designers.</p><p>His new book will balance coverage of conceptual issues (how to\nfit tools like Photoshop to the design workflow rather than fitting\na workflow to the tools) with practical design exercises tailored\nto help communicate the overall design direction of the page while\nrespecting the needs of the fluid Web. In addition, he will\nintroduce methods for taking HTML back into Photoshop for further\nrefinement.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p/><p>This is the third edition of<strong> David Powers</strong>' highly-respected <em>PHP Solutions: Dynamic Web Design Made Easy</em>. This new edition has been updated by David to incorporate changes to PHP since the second edition and to offer the latest techniques—a classic guide modernized for 21st century PHP techniques, innovations, and best practices.</p><p>You want to make your websites more dynamic by adding a feedback form, creating a private area where members can upload images that are automatically resized, or perhaps storing all your content in a database. The problem is, you're not a programmer and the thought of writing code sends a chill up your spine. Or maybe you've dabbled a bit in PHP and MySQL, but you can't get past baby steps. If this describes you, then you've just found the right book. PHP and the MySQL database are deservedly the most popular combination for creating dynamic websites. They're free, easy to use, and provided by many web hosting companies in their standard packages.</p><p>Unfortunately, most PHP books either expect you to be an expert already or force you to go through endless exercises of little practical value. In contrast, this book gives you real value right away through a series of practical examples that you can incorporate directly into your sites, optimizing performance and adding functionality such as file uploading, email feedback forms, image galleries, content management systems, and much more. Each solution is created with not only functionality in mind, but also visual design.</p><p>But this book doesn't just provide a collection of ready-made scripts: each PHP Solution builds on what's gone before, teaching you the basics of PHP and database design quickly and painlessly. By the end of the book, you'll have the confidence to start writing your own scripts or—if you prefer to leave that task to others—to adapt existing scripts to your own requirements. Right from the start, you're shown how easy it is to protect your sites by adopting secure coding practices.</p></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p>This is the second edition of David Power's highly-respected <em>PHP Solutions: Dynamic Web Design Made Easy</em>. This new edition has been updated by David to incorporate changes to PHP since the first edition and to offer the latest techniques--a classic guide modernized for 21st century PHP techniques, innovations, and best practices.</p><p>You want to make your websites more dynamic by adding a feedback form, creating a private area where members can upload images that are automatically resized, or perhaps storing all your content in a database. The problem is, you're not a programmer and the thought of writing code sends a chill up your spine. Or maybe you've dabbled a bit in PHP and MySQL, but you can't get past baby steps. If this describes you, then you've just found the right book. PHP and the MySQL database are deservedly the most popular combination for creating dynamic websites. They're free, easy to use, and provided by many web hosting companies in their standard packages.</p><p>Unfortunately, most PHP books either expect you to be an expert already or force you to go through endless exercises of little practical value. In contrast, this book gives you real value right away through a series of practical examples that you can incorporate directly into your sites, optimizing performance and adding functionality such as file uploading, email feedback forms, image galleries, content management systems, and much more. Each solution is created with not only functionality in mind, but also visual design.</p><p>But this book doesn't just provide a collection of ready-made scripts: each PHP Solution builds on what's gone before, teaching you the basics of PHP and database design quickly and painlessly. By the end of the book, you'll have the confidence to start writing your own scripts or--if you prefer to leave that task to others--to adapt existing scripts to your own requirements. Right from the start, you're shown how easy it is to protect your sites by adopting secure coding practices.</p></span></span></span>",

While their benefits motivate their creation, there are no well-established guidelines for design. This often results in inconsistent behaviors and appearances, even among web applications created by the same company. <br/><br/>Design patterns for web applications, similar in concept to those for web sites and software design, offer an effective solution. In <i>Web Application Design Patterns</i>, Pawan Vora documents design patterns for web applications by not only identifying design solutions for user interaction problems, but also by examining the rationale for their effectiveness, and by presenting how they should be applied.<ul><li>Design interfaces faster, with a better rationale for the solutions you choose.</li><li>Learn from over more than 100 patterns, with extensive annotation on use and extension.</li><li>Take a short-cut into understanding the industry with more than 500 full-color screenshots.</li></ul>\n</span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>Cascading style sheets (CSS) are the modern standard for website presentation. When combined with a structural markup language such as HTML, XHTML, or XML (though not limited to these), cascading style sheets provide Internet browsers with the information that enables them to present all the visual aspects of a web document. Cascading style sheets apply things such as borders, spacing between paragraphs, headings or images, control of font faces or font colors, background colors and images, textual effects such as underlined or strike-through text, layering, positioning, and a number of other presentational effects. CSS controls the presentational aspects of a web page's design, whereas HTML, XHTML, or XML controls the structure of a web page, which means little more than determining that certain text is a heading, other text is a paragraph, still other text is a list of hyperlinks, and so on. CSS provides enhanced and precise visual rendering; markup languages such as HTML provide meaning and structure.</p><p><em>Beginning CSS: Cascading Style Sheets for Web Design, Second Edition</em> covers all the details required to combine CSS with HTML, XHTML, or XML to create rich, aesthetically powerful designs. Throughout the book, you'll focus on combining CSS with XHTML specifically because XHTML is the standard hailed by Internet standards bodies as the successor to HTML and the present and future of website design. CSS and XHTML allow a web document to be presented with less code, resulting in a significantly smaller file size and greatly increased ease of maintenance. CSS also enables the presentation of a web document to be centralized, which allows for the look and feel of an entire website to be written and centralized in one or a few simple documents, which makes updating a website a breeze. With only a few simple edits to a single document, the look and feel of an entire website can be completely changed.</p><p>By using modern standards like CSS and XHTML, you can drastically reduce the cost of building and maintaining a website when compared to legacy HTML-only pages. You can also greatly reduce the amount of physical bandwidth and hard disk space required, resulting in immediate long-term benefits for any website.</p><p>This book also discusses how to style XML documents with CSS—XML being a more advanced markup language with multipurpose applications. XML will play an increasingly larger role in the production of XHTML documents in the future.</p><p>This second edition of <em>Beginning CSS</em> features a near-complete overhaul of the content from the first edition. Changes based on what readers had to say about the first edition helped to create the most comprehensive introduction on CSS available on the market. Throughout this book, you see CSS broken down into simple examples that focus on a single concept at a time. This allows you to better understand how and why something works, since you aren't presented with a lot of irrelevant code, and you can better see the bits and pieces that come together that make something work. While these examples may not be particularly pretty, they are extremely valuable learning tools that will help you master cascading style sheets.</p><p>To enhance the learning experience, most of the source code examples are presented in syntax-colored code, a special feature in this book. Syntax coloring is a feature that you commonly see in fancy development software, such as Zend Studio (used to develop PHP), or Microsoft's Visual Studio (used to develop ASP, C#, and so on), and other software used by professional programmers every day. Syntax coloring is used in these software suites to make programming easier and more intuitive, and it offers tremendous benefits in teaching as well. It allows you to see what the different bits and pieces are in source code, since each of the different bits and pieces has a different coloring to identify its purpose. It helps you to distinguish the building blocks of code more easily, and if you use similar development software to write your CSS and HTML documents, you'll also find that you make fewer mistakes and typos, since syntax coloring also helps you to write code that is more bug free.</p><p>Many of the source code examples feature annotations to highlight important, not-to-be-forgotten bits of information, and to visually point out concepts that are discussed in the surrounding text.</p><p>This edition also features every screenshot from a browser in color, a first for Wrox. Presenting the browser screenshots in color makes it easier for you to compare your results with what you see in the book.</p><p>This book also approaches CSS development from a browser-neutral point of view, and provides all the information that you need to get a good healthy start on professional cross-browser, cross-platform website design with IE 6, IE 7, Firefox 2, Opera 9, and Safari 2, which will allow you to reach over 99 percent of the web browsing public.</p><p>You also see comprehensive coverage of bugs, and workarounds for the IE 6 and IE 7 web browsers. Long a thorn in the side of CSS developers, making CSS work in IE 6 can be quite a chore without detailed knowledge of its quirks and shortcomings. This book covers many of the hacks and nonstandard workarounds that you may need to develop compatible CSS content in IE 6. IE 7 features many great improvements to CSS support, and though they are much fewer than its predecessor, you still need a few tricks to make your web page shine in Microsoft's latest browser. It covers the workarounds that you'll need to make your pages work just as well in IE 7 as they do in all the other popular browsers. In addition, you'll find the quick reference in Appendix B updated to reflect all of IE 7's new CSS support.</p><p>Along with better coverage of Internet Explorer, there's greatly improved coverage of Mac OS X browsers, Safari, Firefox, and Opera. You'll see that Mac browsers are equally represented among their Windows brethren.</p><p><b>Whom Is This Book For?</b> This book's primary audience is anyone seeking to learn how to use cascading style sheets to present web documents. Because cascading style sheets are used to control the presentational layout of a web document, people from backgrounds in art, graphic design, or those who prepare print layouts for publishing will feel at home using CSS. Regardless of your background, CSS is a simple and powerful language designed so that anyone can understand and use it.</p><p>To get the most out of this book, you need some experience with markup languages like HTML or XHTML. If you are completely new to website design and development, you should begin learning web programming with Jon Duckett's <em>Beginning Web Programming with HTML, XHTML, and CSS</em>. Jon Duckett's book provides a complete overview of website development and design for the complete beginner, whereas <em>Beginning CSS: Cascading Style Sheets for Web Design, Second Edition</em> focuses specifically on the role of CSS in website design.</p><p>This book presents all of the material you need to become comfortable with writing CSS from scratch.</p><p><b>What Does This Book Cover?</b> This book covers portions of the CSS Level 1, 2, 2.1, and 3 specifications. These specifications are created by an independent, not-for-profit Internet standards organization called the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that plans and defines how Internet documents work. The majority of the book is written using what is defined in the CSS Level 2.1 specification.</p><p>This book leads you through how to write CSS so that it is compatible with all of the most popular web browsers, focused on all of the following popular browsers:</p><ul><li><p>Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 for Windows</p></li><li><p>Windows Internet Explorer 7 for Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows Server 2003, Windows XP Professional 64 bit, and Windows Vista</p></li><li><p>Safari 2 for Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger)</p></li><li><p>Mozilla Firefox 2 for Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux</p></li><li><p>Opera 9 for Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux</p></li></ul><p>The preceding browsers make up over 99 percent of the web browser market share at the time of this writing. For your convenience, this book also includes an integrated CSS feature reference throughout the book, as well as notes on browser compatibility. A CSS reference is also included in Appendix B.</p><p><b>How This Book Is Structured:</b> This book is divided into three parts. The following explains each of these three parts in detail, and what each chapter covers.</p><p><b>Part I: The Basics:</b> Throughout Chapters 1 through 4 you learn the founding principles of CSS-based web design.</p><ul><li><p><b>Chapter 1, \"Introducing Cascading Style Sheets\":</b> This chapter talks about what CSS is, why it exists, who created it, where it is maintained, and how it has evolved. It also discusses some of the basic differences among the various CSS specifications—CSS Level 1, CSS Level 2, CSS Level 2.1, and CSS Level 3—and how these specifications define what CSS is. You also learn more about each of the most popular browsers in use today, how to obtain them, and write your first CSS-enabled document. It also shows you how to install Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 7 side-by-side on the same computer for testing.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 2, \"The Essentials\":</b> This chapter introduces the basics of CSS. Now that you have seen an example CSS document, this chapter introduces CSS rules and how selectors and declarations are combined to create rules. It demonstrates the various methods used to include CSS in a document. It explains how keywords are used in CSS to create predefined behavior, and how strings are used in CSS to refer to font names in a style sheet. It presents the various units of measurement that CSS supports. Finally, it talks about the different ways of specifying color.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 3, \"Selectors\":</b> Chapter 2 introduced the concept of selectors. Chapter 3 talks about complex selectors, and how you apply style to a portion of a document based on its context within the document or user-initiated events.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 4, \"The Cascade and Inheritance\":</b> In Chapter 4, you learn about how to override styles, how precedence works in a style sheet, and how some styles can be considered more important than others, concepts that come together to define the cascade in cascading style sheets. You also learn how once you set some styles in a document, those styles can be inherited to other parts of a document depending on the context in which they are applied.</p></li></ul><p><b>Part II: Properties:</b> Throughout Chapters 5 through 12, you learn about properties that are used to manipulate the presentation of a document.</p><ul><li><p><b>Chapter 5, \"Text Manipulation\":</b> Chapter 5, presents the various properties that CSS provides for text manipulation. These properties provide effects such as controlling the amount of space between the letters of words, controlling the amount of space between the words of a paragraph, controlling text alignment, underlining, overlining, or strike-through text. It also shows how to control the case of text by making text all lowercase, uppercase, or capitalized.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 6, \"Fonts\":</b> After you have seen the properties that CSS provides for text manipulation in Chapter 5, Chapter 6 presents the CSS properties you can use to manipulate the presentation of fonts. These effects include applying bold text, setting a font face, setting the font size, setting an italic font, as well as learning to use a property that enables you to specify all CSS's font effects in one single property.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 7, \"The Box Model\":</b> Chapter 7 elaborates on a design concept fundamental to CSS design: The Box Model. You learn how the box model plays an important role in determining layout dimensions. Using the margin, border, padding, width, and height properties, you can control how much space elements within a document occupy, how much space separates them, whether there are borders around them, whether scroll bars should be included. It also discusses a CSS phenomenon known as margin collapsing, which is what happens when top or bottom margins come into direct contact with other top or bottom margins in a web document.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 8, \"CSS Buoyancy:</b> Floating and Vertical Alignment\": Chapter 8, discusses <code>float</code> and <code>clear</code>, two properties used to control the flow of layout in a web document and often used to flow text beside images. It also discusses the <code>vertical-align</code> property, which is used to create effects like subscript or superscript text, as well as to control vertical alignment in table cells.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 9, \"List Properties\":</b> In this chapter, you'll look at the properties CSS provides to control presentation of ordered and unordered lists. This discussion includes the options CSS provides for predefined list markers, custom list markers, and the position of list markers.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 10, \"Backgrounds\":</b> Chapter 10, presents the properties CSS provides to control backgrounds in a web page. This includes properties that set a background color or background image, as well as those that control the position of a background, the tiling of a background, and whether a background remains fixed in place as a web page is scrolled or remains static. Finally, the chapter shows you how to use a property that combines all these individual effects into a single property.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 11, \"Positioning\":</b> You'll see four different types of positioning: static, relative, absolute, and fixed. You use positioning primarily to layer portions of a document. It also describes some of the practical uses for positioning, such as creating a multicolumn layout.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 12, \"Tables\":</b> Chapter 12, presents the different properties that CSS provides for styling (X)HTML tables. The properties presented in this chapter let you control the spacing between the cells of a table, the placement of the table caption, and whether empty cells are rendered. It also looks in detail at the available tags and options that (X)HTML provides for structuring tabular data.</p></li></ul><p><b>Part III: Advanced CSS and Alternative Media:</b> Throughout Chapters 13, 14, and 15 you learn about how to use CSS to make documents for printing, and another kind of document altogether, XML.</p><ul><li><p><b>Chapter 13, \"Styling for Print\":</b> This chapter discusses what steps to take to use CSS to provide alternative style sheets to create a printer-friendly version of a web document.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 14, \"XML\":</b> In this chapter, you see how you can use CSS to style XML content. This chapter focuses specifically on the CSS display property and how you use this property to change the behavior of tags in an XML or HTML/XHTML document.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 15, \"The Cursor Property\":</b> Here you see how you can change the user's mouse cursor using CSS, how you can customize the mouse cursor, and what browsers support which cursor features.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 16, \"Dean Edwards's 'IE7'\":</b> This chapter talks about one alternative to many of the hacks and workarounds that you need for IE6. It talks about how to install an HTTP server for your website, and how to install and use Dean Edwards's \"IE7\" JavaScript, which is a collection of IE6 hacks and workarounds designed to make \"IE6\" feature compatible with its successor. This chapter is available online only, on the Wrox website at <code>www.wrox.com/go/beginning_css2e</code>.</p></li><li><p><b>Appendixes:</b> Appendix A contains the answers to chapter exercises. Appendix B, \"CSS Reference,\" provides a place for you to look up CSS features and browser compatibility on the fly. Appendix C, \"CSS Colors,\" provides a reference of CSS named colors. Appendix D, \"Browser Rendering Modes,\" provides a reference for the browser rendering modes invoked by the presence or absence of a Document Type Declaration (discussed in Chapter 7).</p></li></ul></span></span>",

While not everyone uses those standards, or uses them correctly, there is a large body of knowledge, best practice, and proven results in those fields, and a good education system for teaching professionals \"how to.\" For the newer field of Web application design, however, designers are forced to reuse the old rules on a new platform. This book provides a roadmap that will allow readers to put complete working applications on the Web, display the results of a process that is running elsewhere, and update a database on a remote server using an Internet rather than a network connection. <br/><br/>Web Application Design Handbook describes the essential widgets and development tools that will the lead to the right design solutions for your Web application. Written by designers who have made significant contributions to Web-based application design, it delivers a thorough treatment of the subject for many different kinds of applications, and provides quick reference for designers looking for some fast design solutions and opportunities to enhance the Web application experience. This book adds flavor to the standard Web design genre by juxtaposing Web design with programming for the Web and covers design solutions and concepts, such as intelligent generalization, to help software teams successfully switch from one interface to another.<br/><br/>* The first interaction design book that focuses exclusively on Web applications.<br/>* Full-color figures throughout the book.<br/>* Serves as a \"cheat sheet\" or \"fake book\" for designers: a handy reference for standards, rules of thumb, and tricks of the trade.<br/>* Applicable to new Web-based applications and for porting existing desktop applications to Web browsers.\n</span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>At the start of every web design project, the ongoing struggles\nreappear. We want to design highly usable and self-evident\napplications, but we also want to devise innovative, compelling,\nand exciting interactions that make waves in the market. Projects\nare more sophisticated than ever, but we have fewer resources with\nwhich to complete them. Requirements are fuzzy at best, but\nwe’re expected to have everything done yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we need is a reuse strategy, coupled with a pathway to\ninnovation. Patterns are part of the game. Components take us\nfurther. In <em>Web Anatomy: Interaction Design Frameworks That\nWork</em>, user experience experts Hoekman and Spool introduce\n“interaction design frameworks”, the third and final\npiece of what they call “The Reuse Trinity”, and\nresolve these issues once and for all. Frameworks are sets of\ndesign patterns and other elements that comprise entire systems,\nand in this game-changing book, Hoekman and Spool show you how to\nidentify, document, share, use, and reap the benefits of\nframeworks. They also dive deep into several major frameworks to\nreveal how the psychology behind these standards leads not only to\neffective designs, but can also serve as the basis for cutting-edge\ninnovations and superior user experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeb Anatomy delivers:<br/></p><li><p>A complete guide to using interaction design frameworks</p></li><li><p>An examination of the psychology behind major frameworks</p></li><li><p>A thorough look at how frameworks will change the way you work\nfor the better</p></li><p>Citing examples from both the successful and not-so-successful,\nthe authors break down the elements that comprise several common\ninteractive web systems, discuss implementation considerations,\noffer examples of innovations based on these standards, reveal how\nframeworks work hand in hand with patterns and components, and show\nyou how to integrate frameworks into your process.<br/>\n<br/>\nRead Web Anatomy now. Benefit from it for years to come.<br/>\n<br/>\nJared Spool is a world-renowned design researcher and the founder\nof UIE.com.

    "description": "<span><p>“How will our product hurt people?” As web workers, we don’t often ask this question—but we should. Too often, we design for idealized circumstances, even though our users bring a range of complicated personal dynamics to every interaction. When we fail to explicitly design for vulnerable users, we unintentionally prioritize their abusers.<br/><br/>Eva PenzeyMoog explains how even the most well-intentioned design can be weaponized for interpersonal harm. Through poignant, all-too-common examples, Eva demonstrates how to identify a design’s potential for abuse, how to avoid and mitigate the damage, and how to bake safety into every step of the design process. We can’t build good digital products unless we recognize that our users’ safety, and lives, are at stake.</p></span>",

Written by a leading industry expert and design lead at Starbase Go, this book provides a wealth of information and practical guidance from the perspective of a real-world designer. You'll walk through the process of building data visualizations responsively as you learn best practices that build upon responsive web design principles, and get the hands-on practice you need with exercises, examples, and source code provided in every chapter. These strategies are designed to be implemented by teams large and small, with varying skill sets, so you can apply these concepts and skills to your project right away. </p><p>Responsive web design is the practice of building a website to suit base browser capability, then adding features that enhance the experience based on the user's device's capabilities. Applying these ideas to data produces visualizations that always look as if they were designed specifically for the device through which they are viewed. This book shows you how to incorporate these principles into your current practices, with highly practical hands-on training. </p><ul><li>Examine the hard data surrounding responsive design</li><li>Master best practices with hands-on exercises</li><li>Learn data-based document manipulation using D3.js</li><li>Adapt your current strategies to responsive workflows</li></ul><p>Data is growing exponentially, and the need to visualize it in any context has become crucial. Traditional visualizations allow important data to become lost when viewed on a small screen, and the web traffic speaks for itself – viewers repeatedly demonstrate their preference for responsive design. If you're ready to create more accessible, take-anywhere visualizations, <i>Building Responsive Data Visualization for the Web</i> is your tailor-made solution.</p></span></span></span></span></span></span>",

Best-selling author Jakob\nNielsen and coauthor Kara Pernice used rigorous usability\nmethodology and eyetracking technology to analyze 1.5 million\ninstances where users look at Web sites to understand how the human\neyes interact with design. Their findings will help designers,\nsoftware developers, writers, editors, product managers, and\nadvertisers understand what people see or don’t see, when\nthey look, and why.<br/>\n\t\t\t<br/>\nWith their comprehensive three-year study, the authors confirmed\nmany known Web design conventions and the book provides additional\ninsights on those standards. They also discovered important new\nuser behaviors that are revealed here for the first time. Using\ncompelling eye gaze plots and heat maps, Nielsen and Pernice guide\nthe reader through hundreds of examples of eye movements,\ndemonstrating why some designs work and others don’t. They\nalso provide valuable advice for page layout, navigation menus,\nsite elements, image selection, and advertising. This book is\nessential reading for anyone who is serious about doing business on\nthe Web.</p></span>",

In this exceptionally frank account, Chouinard and Stanley recount how the company and its culture gained the confidence, by step and misstep, to make its work progressively more responsible, and to ultimately share its discoveries with companies as large as Wal-Mart or as small as the corner bakery.</p>\n\n<p>In plain, compelling prose, the authors describe the current impact of manufacturing and commerce on the planet's natural systems and human communities, and how that impact now forces business to change its ways. The Responsible Company shows companies how to reduce the harm they cause, improve the quality of their business, and provide the kind of meaningful work everyone seeks. It concludes with specific, practical steps every business can undertake, as well as advice on what to do, in what order.</p>\n\n<p>The advice in this book is simple but powerful: reduce your environmental footprint, make legitimate products that last, reclaim deep knowledge of your business and its supply chain to make the most of opportunities in the years to come, and earn the trust you'll need by treating your workers, customers and communities with respect.<br></p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Many books have covered the rapidly evolving fields of <em>information and communication technology</em> (ICT) and <em>space technology</em> separately. However, no single book has ever focused on how the integration of these two areas is creating a stronger platform for various scientific advancements—including some research work that cannot be performed on Earth. </p><p>To fill the void, <strong>Information, Communication, and Space Technology</strong> provides a novel illustration of that connection. Dividing content into sections that cover ICT, existing and future space technologies, and satellites, the author demonstrates the individual and combined power of each of these parts of the overall system. He explores how the combination of concepts from each of these interrelated fields is creating massive potential for broader advances in areas such as robotics, communications, navigation, agriculture, health care, and nanotechnology. The book introduces particular potential innovations, including \"rocket-less\" spacecraft launches, and development of a global system to balance energy distribution by using satellites that would collect solar energy and transmit it via microwave beams to different locations around the world. </p><p>Equally useful to students and professionals, this work is a culmination of the domestic and international experience that the author has acquired throughout more than three decades as an instructor and researcher. Emphasizing the strong need to incorporate ICT and space technology into the general university curriculum, the book starts with basic explanations of key concepts and theories, building toward more concrete, application-oriented examples that reveal the importance and impact of new technologies. This includes coverage of how satellites transfer voice, video, and other data across continents, as well as techniques used to obtain very-high-resolution images from space for use in agricultural and environmental sciences.This timely work employs a logical, practically structured approach that will help readers to better understand existing and emerging ICT and space technologies, including the most recent developments and achievements in the field.</p></span>",

Today’s CCO is responsible for internal and external communication, with creating and implementing communication strategies that help mold enterprise mission, vision, value, and character, and with building enterprise reputation through stakeholder engagement. As a part of the “C-Suite,” the CCO must understand not only the psychology and sociology of the business, but also the role that she has in informing the C-Suite and the chief executive officer what internal and external stakeholders are thinking and how this may affect corporate image in terms of credibility, confidence, trust, relationship, and reputation. In short, the new CCO must understand both the science and the art of communication and apply that knowledge to advancing her enterprise’s goals and objectives through a faster and ever-larger-reaching set of media.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>In just over a decade, the Web has evolved from an experimental\ntool for a limited community of technically inclined people into a\nday-to-day necessity for millions upon millions of users.\nToday’s Web designers must consider not only the content\nneeds of the sites they create, but also the wide range of\nadditional needs their users may have: for example, those with\nphysical or cognitive disabilities, those with slow modems or small\nscreens, and those with limited education or familiarity with the\nWeb. Bestselling author Sarah Horton argues that simply meeting the\nofficial standards and guidelines for Web accessibility is not\nenough. Her goal is universal usability, and in <b>Access by\nDesign: A Guide to Universal Usability for Web Designers</b>, Sarah\ndescribes a design methodology that addresses accessibility\nrequirements but then goes beyond. As a result, designers learn how\nto optimize page designs to work more effectively for more users,\ndisabled or not. Working through each of the main functional\nfeatures of Web sites, she provides clear principles for using HTML\nand CSS to deal with elements such as text, forms, images, and\ntables, illustrating each with an example drawn from the real\nworld. Through these guidelines, Sarah makes a convincing case that\ngood design principles benefit all users of the Web.</p><p>In this book you will find:</p><li><p>Clear principles for using HTML and CSS to design functional\nand accessible Web sites</p></li><li><p>Best practices for each of the main elements of Web\npages—text, forms, images, tables, frames, links,\ninteractivity, and page layout</p></li><li><p>Seasoned advice for using style sheets that provide flexibility\nto both designer and user without compromising usability</p></li><li><p>Illustrations of actual Web sites, from which designers can\nmodel their own pages</p></li><li><p>Instructions for providing keyboard accessibility, flexible\nlayouts, and user-controlled environments</p></li><li><p>Practical tips on markup, and resources</p></li></span></span>",

With over 8 billion pages online and more\nposted every day, the Web more than likely contains the information\nyou’re looking for — if only you could find it. In\nInformation Trapping: Real-Time Research on the Web,\nInternet-search-engine expert Tara Calishain makes researching more\nefficient and rewarding for anyone for whom the Web is an\nindispensable tool — academics, journalists, scientists, and\nprofessionals, as well as bloggers, genealogists, and hobbyists.\nShe does so by teaching the latest techniques for building\nautomated information-gathering systems. As an alternative to the\ntypical one-time search for information, Tara demonstrates how\nreaders can use RSS feeds, page monitoring tools, and other\nsoftware to set up information streams of many different data types\n— from text to multimedia to conversations — for\ncapture and review.<br/></p></span></span>",

    "title": "The Patron-Driven Library",
    "description": "<span>Libraries in the USA and globally are undergoing quiet revolution. Libraries are moving away from a philosophy that is collection-centered to one focused on service. Technology is key to that change. The Patron Driven Library explores the way technology has moved the focus from library collections to services, placing the reader at the center of library activities. The book reveals the way library users are changing, and how social networking, web delivery of information, and the uncertain landscape of e-print has energized librarians to adopt technology to meet a different model of the library while preserving core values. Following an introduction, the first part begins with the historical milieu, and moves on to current challenges for financing and acquiring materials, and an exploration of why the millennial generation is transformational. The second part examines how changes in library practice can create a culture for imagining library services in an age of information overflow. The final chapter asks: Whither the library?<br/><br/><ul><li>Provides a synthesis of current research on the impact of technology on behaviour, and connecting it with library services</li><li>Offers examples and practical advice for incorporating technology to meet user expectations and assess services</li><li>Suggests management techniques to overcome barriers to change and technology innovation</li></ul></span>",

    "title": "Radical Information Literacy",
    "description": "<span>\nWhat would a synthetic theory of Digital, Media and Information Literacy (DMIL) look like? <i>Radical Information Literacy</i> presents, for the first time, a theory of DMIL that synthesises the diversity of perspectives and positions on DMIL, both in the classroom and the workplace, and within the informal learning processes of society. This title is based on original analysis of how decisions are made about the relevance of information and the other resources used in learning, showing how society has privileged objective approaches (used in rule-based decision making) to the detriment of subjective and intersubjective perspectives which promote individual and community contexts. The book goes on to analyse the academic and popular DMIL literature, showing how the field may have been, consciously or unwittingly, complicit in the ‘objectification’ of learning and the disempowerment of individuals and communities. Alternative ways of conceiving the subject are then presented, towards a reversal of these trends.<ul><li>Synthesises key theorists of digital, media and information literacy and information behaviour</li><li>Includes the field of ‘community informatics’</li><li>Conducts a bibliometric analysis of a broad spectrum of writings on digital, media and information literacy, analysing the connections between them and the frames of DMIL within which they are located</li></ul>\n</span>",

    "title": "Proactive Marketing for the New and Experienced Library Director",
    "description": "<span>\nAcademic libraries have continually looked for technological solutions to low circulation statistics, under-usage by students and faculty, and what is perceived as a crisis in relevance, seeing themselves in competition with Google and Wikipedia. Academic libraries, however, are as relevant as they have been historically, as their primary functions within their university missions have not changed, but merely evolved. Going beyond the Gate Count argues that the problem is not relevance, but marketing and articulation. This book offers theoretical reasoning and practical advice to directors on how to better market the function of the library within and beyond the home institution. The aim of this text is to help directors, and ultimately, their librarians and staff get students and faculty back into the library, as a result of better articulation of the library’s importance. The first chapter explores the promotion of academic libraries and their function as educational systems. The next two chapters focus on the importance of the role social media and virtual presence in the academic library, and engaging and encouraging students to use the library through a variety of methods, such as visually oriented special collections. Remaining chapters discuss collaboration and collegiality, formalized reporting and marketing.<ul><li>Offers clear, concise writing, with thoughtful discussions of the problems facing academic libraries </li><li>Demonstrates comprehensive and thoughtful research that informs theoretical approaches to realistic outcomes that address these problems</li><li>Provides helpful tables, illustrations, and photographs that evidence the collaborative nature of contemporary academic libraries</li><li>Provides practical examples from actual experiences that can be adapted by readers</li></ul>\n</span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p><b>Leveraging Big Data and 21st century technology to renew cities and citizenship in America</b></p><p><em>The Responsive City: Engaging Communities Through Data-Smart Governance</em>. The Responsive City is a guide to civic engagement and governance in the digital age that will help leaders link important breakthroughs in about technology and big data analytics with age-old lessons of small-group community input to create more agile, competitive, and economically resilient cities. Featuring vivid case-studies highlighting the work of individuals in New York, Boston, Rio de Janeiro, Stockholm, Indiana, and Chicago, the book provides a compelling model for the future of cities and states. The authors demonstrate how digital innovations will drive a virtuous cycle of responsiveness centered on \"empowerment\" : 1) empowering public employees with tools to both power their performance and to help them connect more personally to those they service, 2) empowering constituents to see and understand problems and opportunities faced by cities so that they can better engage in the life of their communities, and 3) empowering leaders to drive towards their missions and address the grand challenges confronting cities by harnessing the predictive power of cross-government Big Data, the book will help mayors, chief technology officers, city administrators, agency directors, civic groups and nonprofit leaders break out of current paradigms in order to collectively address civic problems. Co-authored by Stephen Goldsmith, former Mayor of Indianapolis, and current Director of the Innovations in Government Program at the Harvard Kennedy School and Susan Crawford, co-director of Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society.</p><p><em>The Responsive City</em> highlights the ways in which leadership, empowered government employees, thoughtful citizens, and 21st century technology can combine to improve government operations and strengthen civic trust. It provides actionable advice while exploring topics like:</p><li><p>Visualizing service delivery and predicting improvement</p></li><li><p>Making the work of government employees more meaningful</p></li><li><p>Amplification and coordination of focused citizen engagement</p></li><li><p>Big Data in big cities - stories of surprising successes and enormous potential</p></li></span></span>",

Those businesses that enjoy a good reputation are able to differentiate themselves, thus attracting investments and retaining customers and employees, while at the same time, stakeholders of such companies demonstrate higher levels of satisfaction and loyalty towards the companies’ products and brands.<br/> Currently, corporate reputation is one of the most popular non-financial indicators used by organizations, both in the public and private sectors. This book is an in-depth investigation of the psychosocial nature of corporate reputation, and we invite the reader to join us on a journey of discovery.<br/> When reputation first appeared as a concept, it brought about promises and hopes. It was viewed as a solution capable of reconciling the interests of different stakeholders and making the whole organization stronger. However, this giant soon turned out to have feet of clay, as it was lacking in sufficient theoretical and methodological foundation. Nonetheless, when we step into the terra incognita of corporate intangible assets, we will understand that the vague idea of reputation is gradually acquiring a scientific form thanks to the development of measurement tools and models that lay a foundation for the long sought-after means of managing reputation.</p></span></span></span>",

Depending on its origin and content, from our personal beliefs and convictions, we bestow upon this piece of information, spontaneously or after reflection, a certain amount of confidence. Too much confidence shows a degree of naivety, whereas an absolute lack of it condemns us as being paranoid. These two attitudes are symmetrically detrimental, not only to the proper perception of this information but also to its use. Beyond these two extremes, each person generally adopts an intermediate position when faced with the reception of information, depending on its provenance and credibility. We still need to understand and explain how these judgements are conceived, in what context and to what end.</p><p>Spanning the approaches offered by philosophy, military intelligence, algorithmics and information science, this book presents the concepts of information and the confidence placed in it, the methods that militaries, the first to be aware of the need, have or should have adopted, tools to help them, and the prospects that they have opened up. Beyond the military context, the book reveals ways to evaluate information for the good of other fields such as economic intelligence, and, more globally, the informational monitoring by governments and businesses.</p><p>Contents</p><p>1.

Most books on web\ndevelopment concentrate on either the graphics or the technical\nissues of a site. This book focuses on the framework that holds the\ntwo together. This edition contains more than 75% new material.\nYou'll find updated chapters on organization, labeling, navigation,\nand searching; and a new chapter on thesauri, controlled\nvocabularies and metadata will help you understand the\ninterconnectedness of these systems. The authors have expanded the\nmethodology chapters to include a more interdisciplinary collection\nof tools and techniques. They've also complemented the top-down\nstrategies of the first edition with bottom-up approaches that\nenable distributed, emergent solutions. A whole new section\naddresses the opportunities and challenges of practicing\ninformation architecture, while another section discusses how that\nwork impacts and is influenced by the broader organizational\ncontext. New case studies provide models for creating enterprise\nintranet portals and online communities. Finally, you'll find\npointers to a wealth of essential information architecture\nresources, many of which did not exist a few years ago. By applying\nthe principles outlined in this completely updated classic, you'll\nbuild web sites and intranets that are easier to navigate and\nappealing to your users, as well as scalable and simple to\nmaintain. <em>Information Architecture for the World Wide Web</em>,\n2nd Edition is a treasure trove of ideas and practical advice for\nanyone involved in building or maintaining a large, complex web\nsite or intranet.\n</p></span></span>",

In <em>The Death of Corporate Reputation</em>,\nYale's Jonathan Macey reveals the real, non-intuitive reason, and\noffers a new path forward. <b>For over a century law firms,\ninvestment banks, accounting firms, credit rating agencies and\ncompanies seeking regular access to U.S. capital markets made large\ninvestments in their reputations.  They treated customers well\nand </b><b>sometimes</b> <b>endured losses in transactions or\nbusiness deals in order to </b><b>sustain and nurture</b>\n<b>their reputations as faithful brokers and\n“gate-keepers.”  This has changed\ncompletely</b><b>. The existing business model among leading\nparticipants in today’s capital markets no longer treats\ncustomers as valued clients whose trust must be earned and\nnurtured, but as </b><b>one-off</b>\n<b>“counter-parties” to whom no duties are</b> <b>owed\nand no loyalty is required</b><b>.  The rough and tumble norms\nof the market-place have replaced the long-standing</b>\n<b>reputational</b> <b>model in U.S.\nfinance. <br/></b><br/></p><p><b>This book describes the transformation\nin</b><b>American finance</b><b>from the old reputational model\nto the existing <em>laissez faire</em> model and argues that the\nchange came as a result of </b><b>three</b><b>factors: (1)\nthe growth of reliance on regulation rather than reputation as the\nprimary mechanism for protecting customers and (2) the increasing\ncomplexity of regulation, which made technical expertise rather\nthan reputation the primary criterion on which customers choose who\nto do business with in today’s markets</b><b>; and (3) the\nrise of the “cult of personality” on Wall Street, which\nhas led to a secular demise in the relevance of companies’\nreputations and the concomitant rise of individual\n“rain-makers” reputation as the basis for premium\npricing of financial services.</b><em>This compelling book will\ndrive the debate about the financial crisis and financial\nregulation for years to come</em><em>--</em><em>both inside and\noutside the industry</em>.</p></span></span></span>",

Still, the firms we work for, admire and invest in seem to take costly reputation hits all too often. Everyone interested in managing, regulating or investing in public firms will find Nir Kossovsky's book a wonderful read through reputations won, lost and regained over the last 20 years. This is the first book which goes beyond platitudes to explain how to spot value destroying reputation risk and how to manage it or live with its consequences. Couldn't be more timely.\"</p><p>—Tom Skwarek, Managing Director|Structuring and Solutions Group, Unicredit Bank AG; previously Managing Director|Corporate Strategic Solutions, Swiss Re.</p><p>\"There are fiduciary reasons why corporate directors would benefit from reading this book. There is also a personal benefit. The collapse of a company's reputation can stain the personal reputation of its directors.\"</p><p>—George Miles, Member of the Board of Directors, AIG, EQT, Harley Davidson, HFF, and Wesco.</p><p>\"Nir Kossovsky has written a gripping tale, first educating the reader, by distinguishing between corporate branding and reputation, then alarming us with case histories of mismanagement of corporate reputational crises, and finally reassuring all with a unique solution, i.e. insuring against the risk of reputational loss.\"</p><p>—John H. Bennett, Partner, Global Brand Positioning, previously Chief Marketing Officer, Visa, Inc.</p><p>\"While directors know reputation is important, it often is treated as a vague 'good' until something bad happens. Nir Kossovsky does a great job, with many examples, of connecting reputation to stock price and to behaviors, before and after crises. If you are a director, a senior manager, or a regulator, you should read this book and remember the lessons it offers. There is no office which will restore reputation, but careful planning and quick response, as Nir points out, can make a big difference.\"</p><p>—Herbert S. Winokur, Jr., former chairman on Enron's Board Finance Committee and a director of many for-profits and non-profits</p><p>A company that takes a hit to its reputation—BP after the Gulf oil spill, Barclays after fiddling LIBOR, News Corp after the phone hacking scandal—enters a world of grief: market value falls along with employee morale, regulatory scrutiny increases, and customers defect and boycott. Reputation, Stock Price, and You: Why the Market Rewards Some Companies and Punishes Others shows how a company's reputation is created and how reputational value impacts corporate P&amp;L and the personal finances of its many stakeholders. Better yet, it shows what you can do to profit from, increase, protect, monitor, evaluate, restore, and even insure reputational value.</p><p>If your job, bonus, options, salary, or investments depend on the stock price of a public company—or on the sales, profitability, or value of a private company—you need to read this book to understand the concrete steps you can take to improve your firm's reputation, reduce risks to its finances and industry standing, and reap the highest reputational dividends. Using dozens of case studies, Reputation, Stock Price, and You:</p><li><p>Explains how stakeholders, and their expectations, both shape and are shaped by a company's reputation</p></li><li><p>Describes how reputations for ethics, innovation, governance, quality, safety, sustainability, and security are created and lost</p></li><li><p>Shows how you can influence the expectations and behaviors of stakeholders, which in turn can improve corporate finances, reduce operational risk, and increase stock price or market value</p></li><li><p>Provides sensitive tools for tracking and predicting stock price as a function of reputational value metrics</p></li><p>The majority of directors at U.S. public companies now count reputation as their firm's #1 concern, and with good reason. A firm with a superior reputation gains many benefits: Customers are more willing to pay higher prices, vendors and employees offer better terms for their services, creditors and equity investors offer better terms for capital, and regulators tend to be more forgiving. This book shows how to achieve and sustain a stellar reputation and how to convert it into its tangible form: reputational value.</p><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><li><p>How stakeholder expectations for a company help shape a company's reputation</p></li><li><p>How actions taken by a company in managing ethics, innovation, governance, quality, safety, sustainability, and security shape stakeholder expectations</p></li><li><p>How a company's reputation affects stakeholder behavior</p></li><li><p>How corporate executives and directors have the unique opportunity to frame the entire reputation-forming process and build it into governance policies</p></li><li><p>Why professional marketing, and communications efforts play a relatively minor role in reputation formation</p></li><li><p>How the behavior of stakeholders collectively determine a company's stock price or market value</p></li><li><p>How to measure and improve your company's reputation and thus improve results in all areas</p></li><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p>Reputation, Stock Price and You is for senior executives and mid-level managers, directors, and market analysts, fund managers, and sophisticated individual investors.</p></span></span>",

To evaluate their findings, the authors examine the measurement tools that libraries have used to evaluate usage and satisfaction, including contemporary anthropological studies that provide a more detailed view of the student’s approach to research. The book takes a candid look at these redesigns and asks if improvements have lived up to expectations of increased service and user satisfaction. Are librarians using these findings to inform the evolution and implementation of new service models, or have they simply put a new shade of lipstick on the pig?<ul><li>Takes an honest look at learning commons in academic libraries and discusses what is working and what is not</li><li>Explores behind the statistics as to why users come to the library; does the librarians’ concept of ‘the library as place’ match user perception?</li><li>Looks at the anthropology of the user to gauge satisfaction with the services and space provided by the library via recent survey findings</li></ul>\n</span>",

Technology is an essential resource for attaining both organizational and patron goals, and planning needs to emphasize the alignment between the clearly defined goals of each. For this alignment to occur on a consistent basis goals must be designed, or engineered, in a systematic fashion where technology fulfils the need to deliver the desired outcomes in an efficient, cost-effective manner. The concept of usability engineering is also examined, where the technology is planned, designed, and implemented in such a way as to maximize utility and ease-of-use for users and employees. Readers of this book will understand both the why and the how of library technology, planning, and implementation articulated in a simple, easy-to-understand fashion.<br/><br/><ul><li>Delivered from academic, public, and school library media perspectives</li><li>Current and emerging technologies are discussed along with their current and future application in the field of library and information science</li><li>Technology planning and integration is explained using a systems design process with scenarios and case studies that are articulated in a step-wise, holistic fashion</li></ul></span>",

The objective of this video is to help you create a coherent design that speaks to the mission statement of the brand, and that will increase audience engagement and loyalty.</div><div><br/></div><div>The main strategy is to create a brand design that is unique to the business and that has a specific buyer persona in mind (not to try and ‘appeal to everyone’). This will reference Simon Sinek’s ‘Golden Circle’. From there, a logo can be designed or outsourced to reflect that mission statement. This should be simple, re-useable, scalable, and non-cliched, and the design process may involve a mood board. The design should be a vector file and we will look at the technical skills necessary to create such a design.</div><div><br/></div><div>The same branding should then be used through a website, and will help to inform design decisions, as well as across social media. The aim here is 'be everywhere' and 'be consistent'. We will discuss how brand strategy can even influence product design, using Apple as the perfect example. We will also discuss branding in the context of content marketing.</div><div><br/></div><div><b>What You Will Learn</b></div><div><ul><li>Create a design aesthetic that expresses your company's valuers and ethos</li><li>Choose a mission statement and find a buyer persona to help you meet your goals</li><li>Study how you can create and maintain a brand</li></ul></div><div><br/></div><div><b>Who This Video is For</b></div><div>New startups, entrepreneurs, bloggers, and sole traders looking to create a strong platform online.

While this type of testing is essential to user experience design, more companies are also looking to test large sample sizes to be able compare data according to specific user populations and see how their experiences differ across user groups. But few usability professionals have experience in setting up these studies, analyzing the data, and presenting it in effective ways. Online usability testing offers the solution by allowing testers to elicit feedback simultaneously from 1,000s of users. <i>Beyond the Usability Lab</i> offers tried and tested methodologies for conducting online usability studies. It gives practitioners the guidance they need to collect a wealth of data through cost-effective, efficient, and reliable practices.

    "title": "Understanding Your Users",
    "description": "<span>\nToday many companies are employing a user-centered design (UCD) process, but for most companies, usability begins and ends with the usability test.  Although usability testing is a critical part of an effective user-centered life cycle, it is only one component of the UCD process.  This book is focused on the requirements gathering stage, which often receives less attention than usability testing, but is equally as important.  Understanding user requirements is critical to the development of a successful product.  <br/><br/>Understanding Your Users is an easy to read, easy to implement, how-to guide on usability in the real world. It focuses on the \"user requirements gathering\" stage of product development and it provides a variety of techniques, many of which may be new to usability professionals. For each technique, readers will learn how to prepare for and conduct the activity, as well as analyze and present the data —all in a practical and hands-on way. In addition, each method presented provides different information about the user and their requirements (e.g., functional requirements, information architecture, task flows). The techniques can be used together to form a complete picture of the users’ requirements or they can be used separately to address specific product questions. These techniques have helped product teams understand the value of user requirements gathering by providing insight into how users work and what they need to be successful at their tasks. Case studies from industry-leading companies demonstrate each method in action.  In addition, readers are provided with the foundation to conduct any usability activity (e.g., getting buy-in from management, legal and ethical considerations, setting up your facilities, recruiting, moderating activities) and to ensure the incorporation of the results into their products.<br/><br/>·Covers all of the significant requirements gathering methods in a readable, practical way<br/>·Presents the foundation readers need to prepare for any requirements gathering activity and ensure that the results are incorporated into their products <br/>·Includes invaluable worksheet and template appendices<br/>·Includes a case study for each method from industry leaders<br/>·Written by experienced authors who teach conference courses on this subject to usability professionals and new product designers alike\n</span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>\nWe’ve come a long way since the days of flashing banner ads\nand scrolling news tickers. Today, the stunning motion design of\niOS and Android dramatically improves a user’s experience\n— instead of detracting from it. The best sites and apps of\ntoday leverage animation to improve the feel and intuitiveness of\ntheir interfaces. Sites without animation are starting to feel\nantiquated.</p><p><br/></p><p>\nThis book provides you with a technical foundation to implement\nanimation in a way that’s both visually stunning and\nprogrammatically maintainable. Throughout, we consider the balance\nbetween enriching a page with motion design while avoiding\nunnecessary flourishes</p><p><br/></p><p>\nReaders will learn how to design loading sequences that ensure\nusers stay fully engaged instead of tuning out, how to leverage\nsimple physics principles to make apps respond naturally to\nusers’ input (just like motion behaves in the real world),\nhow to exploit CSS transforms to create rich depth in animations,\nand how to fully leverage JavaScript animation libraries like\nVelocity.js to streamline animation programming. From animation\nperformance to theory, we cover everything needed to become a\nprofessional web animator. Whether you're a novice or professional\nweb developer, this book is for everyone.</p><p><br/></p><p>\nWhy is all of this so important? Why is it worth your time to\nbecome a professional motion designer? For the same reason that\ndesigners spend hours perfecting their pages’ font and color\ncombinations, motion designers perfect their animations’\ntransition and easing combinations: Refined products feel superior.\nThey leave users whispering to themselves, “Wow, this is\ncool”, right before they turn to a friend and exclaim,\n“You gotta try this.”</p></span></span>",

How do you decide how much of an investment should be funded? And what is the best way to sell usability to others?</p><p>In this completely revised and new edition of <i>Cost-Justifying Usability</i>, Randolph G. Bias (University of Texas at Austin, with 25 years’ experience as a usability practitioner and manager) and Deborah J. Mayhew (internationally recognized usability consultant and author of two other seminal books including <i>The Usability Engineering Lifecycle</i>) tackle these and many other problems. It has been updated to cover cost-justifying usability for Web sites and intranets, for the complex applications we have today, and for a host of products—offering techniques, examples, and cases that are unavailable elsewhere. No matter what type of product you build, whether or not you are a cost-benefit expert or a born salesperson, this book has the tools that will enable you to cost-justify the appropriate usability investment.</p><ul><li>Includes contributions by a host of experts involved in this work, including Aaron Marcus, Janice Rohn, Chauncey Wilson, Nigel Bevan, Dennis Wixon, Clare-Marie Karat, Susan Dray, Charles Mauro, and many others</li><li>Includes actionable ideas for every phase of the software development process</li><li>Includes case studies from inside a variety of companies</li><li>Includes ideas from \"the other side of the table,\" software executives who hold the purse strings, who offer thoughts on which proposals for usability support they've funded, and which ones they've declined</li></ul></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>The past decade has seen increasing focus on the importance of information and knowledge in economic and social processes, the so-called 'knowledge economy'. This is reflected in the popularity amongst practicing managers and organizational theorists of notions of learning, sense-making, knowledge creation, knowledge management and intellectual capital in organizations and more recently, of emotional intelligence as an important management skill. This insightful book:</p><ul><li>argues that the information processing view of knowledge creation held by systems thinkers is no longer tenable</li><li>develops the alternative perspective of Complex Responsive Processes of relating, drawing on the complexity sciences as a source for analogies with human action</li><li>places self-organizing interaction at the centre of the knowledge creating process in organizations.</li></ul><p>Learning and knowledge creation are seen as qualitative processes of power relating that are emotional as well as intellectual, creative as well as destructive, enabling as well as constraining, and the result is a radical questioning of the belief that organizational knowledge is essentially codified and centralized. Instead, organizational knowledge is understood to be in the relationships between people in an organization and has to do with the qualities of those relationships.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>You don't need to be convinced. You know that usability is key to the success of any interactive system-from commercial software to B2B Web sites to handheld devices. But you need skills to make usability part of your product development equation. How will you assess your users' needs and preferences? How will you design effective solutions that are grounded in users' current practices? How will you evaluate and refine these designs to ensure a quality product?  <i>Usability Engineering: Scenario-Based Development of Human-Computer Interaction</i> is a radical departure from traditional books that emphasize theory and address experts. This book focuses on the realities of product development, showing how user interaction scenarios can make usability practices an integral part of interactive system development. As you'll learn, usability engineering is not the application of inflexible rules; it's a process of analysis, prototyping, and problem solving in which you evaluate tradeoffs, make reasoned decisions, and maximize the overall value of your product.</p><ul><li>Written by prominent HCI educators who understand how to teach usability practices to students and professional developers.</li><li>Interleaves HCI theory and concepts with a running case study demonstrating their application. </li><li>Gradually elaborates the case study to introduce increasingly sophisticated usability engineering techniques.</li><li>Analyzes usability issues in realistic scenarios that describe existing or envisioned systems from the perspective of one or more users.</li><li>Emphasizes the real world of usability engineering-a world in which tradeoffs must be weighed and difficult decisions made to achieve desired results.</li></ul></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>Tired of watching your elegantly constructed Web sites dissolve\ninto a jumble of disorganized pages, broken links, and badly\nwritten code as they're updated and added to over time? Then get\nthis guide and regain control by learning to design and deploy\nDreamweaver sites specifically for use with Macromedia's hot, new\ncontent-management tool Contribute. In the first\nMacromedia-authorized book to cover this natural pairing, veteran\nauthor <b>Joseph Lowery</b> shows you how to develop Dreamweaver\nWeb sites that anyone can update and maintain via Contribute.\nThrough a series of project-based tutorials, Joseph shows you how\nto take advantage of the programs' shared check-in/check-out and\nversioning systems, integrated administration, and myriad other\ncomplementary features to create sophisticated, unbreakable sites\nthat are a breeze for content creators and administrators alike.\nYou'll also find lessons on handling server-side includes,\nestablishing CSS guidelines, working with external documents,\ncreating and using templates, and more! A companion CD includes all\nthe lesson files you'll need to complete the book's\nprojects.<b>**</b><b>Please note:</b> The lessons in the\nbook—and their accompanying files—build upon one\nanother. The basic files are contained in Lesson 2 which, as\ninstructed, are used to create the basic Dreamweaver site. Each\nsubsequent lesson's files are copied on top of the site; the lesson\nfiles are stored in the appropriate folders to make copying a\none-step operation.</p></span></span>",

Why do so many people love Khan Academy?</p><p>The answers are found in Gameful, Social, Interface, and Information patterns. Not only will you learn about these patterns, you'll also learn <em>why</em> they work using psychological theories of intrinsic motivation, behavioral psychology, and behavioral economics. Good and bad implementations of the patterns are shown so practitioners can use them effectively and avoid pitfalls along the way.</p><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><li><p>How to use motivational design patterns to create meaningful user experiences</p></li><li><p>How to write motivational user stories</p></li><li><p>About the psychology of your users</p></li><li><p>Techniques for improving your software in ways your users will notice</p></li><li><p>How to analyze software for motivational effectiveness using case studies and the pattern library</p></li><li><p>How to apply psychological principles and patterns to solve sample design problems</p></li><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p>This book is for software designers and developers working on mobile and web apps, especially those using retention-based payment models.

    "description": "<span><span><p>Like any other software system, Web sites gradually accumulate\n“cruft” over time. They slow down. Links break.\nSecurity and compatibility problems mysteriously appear. New\nfeatures don’t integrate seamlessly. Things just don’t\nwork as well. In an ideal world, you’d rebuild from scratch.\nBut you can’t: there’s no time or money for that.\nFortunately, there’s a solution: You can refactor your Web\ncode using easy, proven techniques, tools, and recipes adapted from\nthe world of software development.<br/><br/>\nIn <em><b>Refactoring HTML,</b></em> Elliotte Rusty Harold explains\nhow to use refactoring to improve virtually any Web site or\napplication. Writing for programmers and non-programmers alike,\nHarold shows how to refactor for better reliability, performance,\nusability, security, accessibility, compatibility, and even search\nengine placement. Step by step, he shows how to migrate obsolete\ncode to today’s stable Web standards, including XHTML, CSS,\nand REST—and eliminate chronic problems like\npresentation-based markup, stateful applications, and “tag\nsoup.”<br/><br/>\nThe book’s extensive catalog of detailed refactorings and\npractical “recipes for success” are organized to help\nyou find specific solutions fast, and get maximum benefit for\nminimum effort. Using this book, you can quickly improve site\nperformance now—and make your site far easier to enhance,\nmaintain, and scale for years to come.<br/><br/>\nTopics covered include<br/><br/>\n•    Recognizing the “smells” of\nWeb code that should be refactored<br/>\n•    Transforming old HTML into well-formed,\nvalid XHTML, one step at a time<br/>\n•    Modernizing existing layouts with\nCSS<br/>\n•    Updating old Web applications: replacing\nPOST with GET, replacing old contact forms, and refactoring\nJavaScript<br/>\n•    Systematically refactoring content and\nlinks<br/>\n•    Restructuring sites without changing the\nURLs your users rely upon<br/><br/>\nThis book will be an indispensable resource for Web designers,\ndevelopers, project managers, and anyone who maintains or updates\nexisting sites. It will be especially helpful to Web professionals\nwho learned HTML years ago, and want to refresh their knowledge\nwith today’s standards-compliant best practices.<br/>\nThis book will be an indispensable resource for Web designers,\ndevelopers, project managers, and anyone who maintains or updates\nexisting sites.

The 6th edition of this popular book has been fully updated for PHP 8, including attributes, constructor property promotion, new argument and return pseudo-types, and more. It also covers many features new since the last edition including typed properties, the null coalescing operator, and void return types. This book provides a solid grounding in PHP's support for objects, it builds on this foundation to instill core principles of software design and then covers the tools and practices needed to develop, test, and deploy robust code.<br/></p><p><i>PHP 8 Objects, Patterns, and Practice</i> begins by covering PHP's object-oriented features. It introduces key topics including class declarations, inheritance, and reflection. The next section is devoted to design patterns. It explains the principles that make patterns powerful. You’ll cover many of the classic design patterns including enterprise and database patterns. The last segment of the book covers the tools and practices that can help turn great code into a successful project. The section shows how to manage multiple developers and releases with git, and how to manage builds and dependencies with Composer. It also explores strategies for automated testing and continuous integration.</p><p>After reading and using this book, you will have mastered object-oriented enhancements, design patterns, and the essential development tools available for PHP 8. </p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Work with object      fundamentals: write classes and methods, instantiate objects, and create      powerful class hierarchies using inheritance</li>  Master advanced      object-oriented features, including static methods and properties, managing      error conditions with exceptions, and creating abstract classes and      interfaces  <li>Understand and use design      principles to deploy objects and classes effectively in your projects</li> <li>Discover a set of powerful      patterns that you can implement in your own projects</li> <li>Guarantee a successful      project including unit testing; version control and build, installation,      and package management; and continuous integration</li> </ul><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>Anyone with at least a basic knowledge of PHP who wants to use its object-oriented features in their projects. It is also for PHP coders who want to learn about the practices and tools (version control, testing, continuous integration, etc) that can make projects safe, elegant and stable.</p></div><div><div><ul> </ul><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div></div></span>",

TypeScript 4 Design Patterns and Best Practices is a one-stop guide to help you learn design patterns and practices to develop scalable TypeScript applications. It will also serve as handy documentation for future maintainers.</p><p> This book takes a hands-on approach to help you get up and running with the implementation of TypeScript design patterns and associated methodologies for writing testable code. You'll start by exploring the practical aspects of TypeScript 4 and its new features. The book will then take you through the traditional gang of four (GOF) design patterns in their classic and alternative form and show you how to use them in real-world development projects. Once you've got to grips with traditional design patterns, you'll advance to learning about their functional programming and reactive programming counterparts and how to couple them to deliver better and more idiomatic TypeScript code.</p><p>By the end of this TypeScript book, you'll be able to efficiently recognize when and how to use the right design patterns in any practical use case and gain the confidence to work on scalable and maintainable TypeScript projects of any size.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Understand the role of design patterns and their significance</li><li>Explore all significant design patterns within the context of TypeScript</li><li>Analyze, and develop classical design patterns in TypeScript</li><li>Find out how design patterns differ from design concepts</li><li>Understand how to put the principles of design patterns into practice</li><li>Discover additional patterns that stem from functional and reactive programming</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>If you're a TypeScript developer looking to learn how to apply established design patterns to solve common programming problems instead of reinventing solutions, you'll find this book useful. You're not expected to have prior knowledge of design patterns. Basic TypeScript knowledge is all you need to get started with this book.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>With the ascent of DevOps, microservices, containers, and cloud-based development platforms, the gap between state-of-the-art solutions and the technology that enterprises typically support has greatly increased. But as Markus Eisele explains in this O’Reilly report, some enterprises are now looking to bridge that gap by building microservice-based architectures on top of Java EE.</p><p>Can it be done? Is it even a good idea? Eisele thoroughly explores the possibility and provides savvy advice for enterprises that want to move ahead. The issue is complex: Java EE wasn’t built with the distributed application approach in mind, but rather as one monolithic server runtime or cluster hosting many different applications. If you’re part of an enterprise development team investigating the use of microservices with Java EE, this book will help you:</p><ul><li> Understand the challenges of starting a greenfield development vs tearing apart an existing brownfield application into services </li>Examine your business domain to see if microservices would be a good fit <li>Explore best practices for automation, high availability, data separation, and performance</li><li>Align your development teams around business capabilities and responsibilities</li><li>Inspect design patterns such as aggregator, proxy, pipeline, or shared resources to model service interactions</li></ul><p>Markus Eisele is a Developer Advocate at Red Hat and focuses on JBoss Middleware. He has been working with Java EE servers from different vendors for more than 14 years, and has worked with different customers on all kinds of Java EE related applications and solutions. He is a prolific blogger, writer, and tech editor for Java EE content. Markus is also a Java Champion and former ACE Director.</p></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><b>Edit and enhance your PDFs easily with PDFpen 13!</b><br/><i>Version 3.0, updated May 4, 2021</i></p><p>Polish your PDFs with Smile's PDFpen, for a fraction of what Adobe Acrobat costs! Michael E. Cohen explains how you can create, combine, edit, annotate, and protect PDFs. Also learn how to perform and edit OCR, fill out forms, sign forms digitally, make interactive forms, and much more. <i>Covers Mac and iOS/iPadOS versions!</i></p><p>These days, an ever-increasing amount of “paper”—contracts, tax forms, bills, reports, and more—comes into our lives as PDF files. We generate this virtual paper too, since it’s so much easier to save a document as a PDF and send it to a colleague via email than it is to print and send via fax or email. To read, edit, and manipulate all these PDFs, you need the appropriate tools and skills.</p><p>Given the high price of Adobe Acrobat DC Pro, many Mac users have turned to Smile’s affordable PDFpen apps to help them sign PDF forms, handle scanned documents, make changes in existing PDFs, create new PDFs from a variety of sources, and to export PDFs to other file formats (including Word and Excel). With <i>Take Control of PDFpen</i>, you’ll learn how to do all these tasks and more on your Mac with <a href=\"https://smilesoftware.com/pdfpen\">PDFpen</a> or <a href=\"https://smilesoftware.com/pdfpenpro\">PDFpenPro</a> or on the go with <a href=\"https://smilesoftware.com/pdfpen-ios\">PDFpen for iPad &amp; iPhone</a>.</p><p>If you haven’t used PDFpen before, this free book is an excellent way to find out what it has to offer.</p><p><i>Take Control of PDFpen</i> begins with a guide to purchasing options: PDFpen versus PDFpenPro, from Smile versus the Mac App Store, and the advantages of the iOS/iPadOS version. Next, you'll meet PDFpen with an overview of the PDF format and a tour of the interface.</p><p>With the basics out of the way, highlights of what you'll learn to do include:</p><ul><li>Add and remove pages, and combine pages from multiple files into one PDF.</li><li>Mark up a PDF with highlights, comments, editing marks, and more.</li><li>Compare two different parts of a PDF with the Split View.</li><li>Edit a PDF by fixing typos, adding text, formatting text, and redacting confidential text. </li><li>Scan a document into a PDF, and make the text editable with OCR—with single or multiple documents.</li><li>Add photos or scans to a PDF quickly with Continuity Camera and an iOS/iPadOS device.</li><li>View and work with OCRed text in the OCR layer (PDFpenPro only)</li><li>Add clickable links, headers, footers, page numbers, and images.</li><li>Annotate a document with lines, shapes, text, and callouts.</li><li>Make a clickable table of contents (PDFpenPro only).</li><li>Add a watermark to each page of a PDF.</li><li>Password-protect a PDF. And (PDFpenPro only), prevent others from printing or editing a PDF. </li><li>Turn a PDF into a formatted Microsoft Word document, or (PDFpenPro only) export it in Excel or PowerPoint format. </li><li>Reduce the size of your PDFs.</li><li>Create blank PDFs with stationery.</li><li>Add a digital signature with DocuSign (PDFpenPro only).</li></ul><p>And, you'll find directions for working with PDF forms:</p><ul><li>Fill out forms with ease.</li><li>Add a handwritten signature.</li><li>Apply a digital signing certificate.</li><li>Print just form entries on a pre-printed form.</li><li>Create an interactive PDF form (PDFpenPro only) that can collect data and send it to you via email or the web. You can add an interactive signature field, which makes it easy for the form to be signed online.</li></ul><p>An appendix describes the useful AppleScripts that ship with PDFpen.</p><p class=\"quote\">This ebook was created in collaboration with Smile, with PDFpen's developers tech editing the book.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>Finally, TheBeerHouse website from <em>ASP.NET 2.0 Website Programming: Problem–Design–Solution</em> gets the ASP.NET 3.5 treatment! This Wrox Blox presents two unique approaches to applying LINQ to SQL to data access in TheBeerHouse. In Part 1, you'll take advantage of the original application's data provider model to develop a custom LINQ to SQL provider for the Articles module. In Part 2, you'll try a different approach, while learning how to develop an ASP.NET 3.5 application using a purely LINQ-based three-tier model.</p><p>Along the way, you'll learn about LINQ to Objects; the newest features of the C# 3.0 language and .NET Framework 3.5 like object initializers, collection initializers, automatic properties, extension methods, lambda expressions, anonymous types, query and method syntax; the IQueryable interface; and deferred execution. You'll learn how to upgrade an existing ASP.NET 2.0 application to ASP.NET 3.5, how to create LINQ to SQL entities from an existing database, and how to extend those entities to provide custom functionality. You'll learn the secrets of creating a faster, more responsive website with LINQ to SQL, including how to use time stamps to speed up concurrency checking, how to take advantage of the ASP.NET view state, how to replace deprecated data-bound controls with better ones, how to pass queries properly between methods, how to return the right data to your user interface, how to streamline your data access methods, and how to compose the most efficient LINQ to SQL queries possible.</p><p>Every aspect of both solutions is described in detail with clear, concise explanations; extensive code listings; and screen shots. Armed with this knowledge, you'll be able to continue on your own, incorporating LINQ technologies in the other TheBeerHouse modules, and in your own applications.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>A New York Times Magazine writer explores the Next Big Thing in tech-the impending revolution in voice recognition-and shows how it will upend Silicon Valley and transform how we use computers, the Web, and much more. Every decade or so brings a seismic shift in how people interact with tech, from the PC to the internet to the smartphone. James Vlahos shows that we are on the cusp of the next shift: to voice computing. Siri and Alexa are early forms of this technology, but the day is coming when we'll talk as fluently with our phones, appliances, cars, etc. as we do with any human. Vlahos explains the enormous AI challenges that voice computing presents, and unpacks its vast economic, cultural, and psychological impact. He reveals how Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and other titans are competing fiercely to create the new voice-driven interfaces. Amazon has devoted an entire secret building to their efforts, and other companies are making similarly huge plays. Vlahos doesn't shy away from the troubling questions that voice computing raises. Will people become emotionally dependent on lifelike computers? Will we confide in them in ways that further erode our privacy? Will they deepen our addiction to all things digital? We are on the verge of a transformation as big as the iPhone. Talk to Me will help us get ready.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Current and emerging trends in the domains of health management and the work sector, the abundance of new consumer products pervading the marketplace, and the desires of many older adults to undertake new learning experiences means that older adults, like their younger counterparts, will need to continually engage in new learning and training. Thus, understanding the challenges that older people face when confronted with new learning and training programs and developing potential strategies to overcome them is imperative. A comprehensive state-of-the-science review, <b>Designing Training and Instructional Programs for Older Adults</b> explores a broad range of issues, from the implications of theories of learning for designing instruction for older adults to adapting current perspectives on methods of instructional design to accommodate the capabilities and limitations of older learners. </p><p/><p>The authors provide an understanding of today’s older adults—their demographics, their needs, the challenges facing them, and a realistic appraisal of their abilities and limitations—as a basis for how current knowledge about training and instructional design should be shaped and applied to best accommodate this population of learners. They discuss topics such as retention and transfer of training, sequencing the order of instruction, e-learning, multimedia training formats, and the assessment and evaluation of training programs from the perspective of issues relevant to older learners. They also highlight the challenges presented by this very heterogeneous group that varies tremendously in backgrounds, skills, knowledge, and abilities.</p><p/><p>Focusing on how learning occurs, the authors’ balanced coverage makes the book readable and enlightening across a wide spectrum of professionals and academics, including human factors/ergonomics specialists, gerontologists, managers, educators, undergraduate and graduate students, and the design community. The book supplies concise recommendations that will have direct impact on the design of instructional programs and for those individuals who are responsible for the training and performance of older people.</p></span>",

Prototypes are typically non-functioning models of apps and websites that give developers and designers the edge on this lengthy creation process. Why?  Because prototypes can be assembled in as little as a single day, saving them time and money. This course teaches you how to use Origami, a prototyping tool created by designers at Facebook that makes it easy to create prototypes for smart apps and websites. You'll explore Origami's interface, learn the principles of prototyping, and gain experience assembling and disseminating a basic prototype.</p><ul><li>Learn to use Origami, the prototyping tool built by designers at Facebook</li><li>Discover what a prototype is and how to organize for the construction of a prototype</li><li>Understand where prototypes fit into the workflow of project development</li><li>See how developers and designers use prototypes in the development of final products</li><li>Learn how to share your project with other developers</li><li>Understand how to build a process without having to write code</li></ul><p>Professor Andy Anderson is the author of dozens of best-selling books and videos, including the O'Reilly titles <i>Learn to Use Photoshop CC 2017</i> and <i>Prototyping with Figma</i>.

Design is about overcoming the limitations of a medium,\nand Web design is no different.

Like an audiobook that you can also watch as a video.</h5><br/> <i>You can base your Micro Frontends directly off the examples in the book!</i><br/>\nBarnaby Norman, Frontend Developer<br/><br/>\n<p>Browser-based software can quickly become complex and difficult to maintain, especially when it's implemented as a large single-page application. By adopting the micro frontends approach and designing your web apps as systems of features, you can deliver faster feature development, easier upgrades, and pick and choose the technology you use in your stack. <i>Micro Frontends in Action</i> is your guide to simplifying unwieldy frontends by composing them from small, well-defined units.</p>\n<h4>about the technology</h4>\n<p>Micro frontends deliver the same flexibility and maintainability to browser-based applications that microservices provide for backend systems. You design your project as a set of standalone components that include their own interfaces, logic, and storage. Then you develop these mini-applications independently and compose them in the browser.</p>\n<h4>about the book</h4>\n<p><i>Micro Frontends in Action</i> teaches you to apply the microservices approach to the frontend. You’ll start with the core micro frontend design ideas. Then, you'll build an e-commerce application, working through practical issues like server-side and client-side composition, routing, and maintaining a consistent look and feel. Finally, you'll explore team workflow patterns that maximize the benefit of developing application components independently.</p>\n<h4>what's inside</h4>\n<ul><li>Create a unified frontend from independent applications\n</li><li>Combine JavaScript code from multiple frameworks\n</li><li>Browser and server-side composition and routing\n</li><li>Implement effective dev teams and project workflow\n</li></ul>\n<h4>about the audience</h4>\n<p>For web developers, software architects, and team leaders.</p>\n<h4>about the author</h4>\n<p><b>Michael Geers</b> is a software developer specializing in building user interfaces.</p>\n<i>An excellent starting point to understand how to introduce micro frontends in your projects.</i><br/>\nPotito Coluccelli<br/><br/>\n<i>Expert practical advice for robust frontend development.

Error handling is about more than just the mechanics in the PHP syntax, but also about handling MySQL errors, logging those errors, and about hiding information about application internals that error messages sometimes can expose.</p><p>Meet these challenges and more head-on! Author Marc Rochkind shows how to begin a project right, with a clear contract and set of written requirements. You'll learn about project organization, setting up a solid development environment, connecting with client personnel. Database design is essential, and <em>Expert PHP and MySQL</em> has you covered with guidance on creating a sound model and database, and on pushing functionality into the database as appropriate; not everything should be done in PHP.</p><p>Error handling is covered at both the PHP and MySQL levels. Application structure is covered. Guidance is provided on reporting. And finally there is conversion. In <em>Expert PHP and MySQL</em> you'll explore the following:</p><p>The popular and widely used combination of PHP and MySQL</p><li><p>Commercial-grade application of language and database features</p></li><li><p>Human factors such as planning and organization</p></li><li><p>Organizing a project to meet requirements and satisfy the customer</p></li><li><p>Structuring an application for efficient development and future modification</p></li><li><p>Coding PHP for productivity, reliability, security</p></li><li><p>Generating online, downloadable, and printed reports</p></li><li><p>Converting existing data to the new application</p></li><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><li><p>Organize a project to meet requirements and satisfy the customer.</p></li><li><p>Structure an application for efficient development and future modification.</p></li><li><p>Design a database to model the business and support the application.</p></li><li><p>Code PHP for productivity, reliability, security.</p></li><li><p>Generate online, downloadable, and printed reports.</p></li><li><p>Convert existing data to the new application.</p></li><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p><em>Expert PHP and MySQL</em> is aimed at programmers competent in PHP and MySQL.
