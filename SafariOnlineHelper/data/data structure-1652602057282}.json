    "description": "<span><p>Create good data from the start, rather than fixing it after it is collected. By following the guidelines in this book, you will be able to conduct more effective analyses and produce timely presentations of research data.</p><p>Data analysts are often presented with datasets for exploration and study that are poorly designed, leading to difficulties in interpretation and to delays in producing meaningful results.  Much data analytics training focuses on how to clean and transform datasets before serious analyses can even be started. Inappropriate or confusing representations, unit of measurement choices, coding errors, missing values, outliers, etc., can be avoided by using good dataset design and by understanding how data types determine the kinds of analyses which can be performed.<br/></p><p>This book discusses the principles and best practices of dataset creation, and covers basic data types and their related appropriate statistics and visualizations. A key focus of the book is why certain data types are chosen for representing concepts and measurements, in contrast to the typical discussions of how to analyze a specific data type once it has been selected.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><p></p><ul><li>Be aware of the principles of creating and collecting data</li><li>Know the basic data types and representations</li><li>Select data types, anticipating analysis goals</li><li>Understand dataset structures and practices for analyzing and sharing</li><li>Be guided by examples and use cases (good and bad)</li><li>Use cleaning tools and methods to create good data</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>Researchers who design studies and collect data and subsequently conduct and report the results of their analyses can use the best practices in this book to produce better descriptions and interpretations of their work. In addition, data analysts who explore and explain data of other researchers will be able to create better datasets.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>Though we have in the past depended on traditional data warehouses to drive business intelligence from data, they were generally based on databases and structured data formats and proved insufficient for the challenges that the current data-driven world faces. Enter data lakes, which are optimized for unstructured and semistructured data, can scale to petabytes easily, and allow better integration of a wide range of tools to help businesses get the most out of their data. Data and software professionals are now moving toward a disaggregated architecture, which makes each layer much more independent and allows them to use the perfect tool for each job.</p><p>California State University took a different approach by residing most of their logic within a programming framework that allowed them to build a testable platform. By applying DataOps techniques, they were able to create reusable, scalable, and extensible data architectures.</p><p>Recorded on November 2, 2021.

You will see the typical data science steps and techniques utilized by data professionals. Next, you will build a simple chatbot so you can get a clear sense of what is involved.</p><p>The next part is an introduction to data science in Python. You will have an opportunity to master Python for data science as each section is followed by an assignment to practice your skills. By the end of the section, you will understand Python fundamentals, decision and looping structures, Python functions, how to work with nested data, and list comprehension. Finally, we will wrap up the two most popular libraries for data science—NumPy and Pandas.</p><p>The last part delves into essential math for data science. You will get the hang of linear algebra along with probability and statistics. Our goal for the linear algebra part is to introduce all necessary concepts and intuition for an in-depth understanding of an often-utilized technique for data fitting called least squares. We will spend a lot of time on probability, both classical and Bayesian, as reasoning about problems is a much more difficult aspect than simply running statistics.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will understand data science methodology and how to use essential math in your real projects.</p><p><b>Audience</b></p><p>This course is designed for people who are new to data science or who are interested in pursuing a career in data science, as well as those who wish to obtain a broad overview before diving into specialized data science topics.</p><p>This course will also benefit students who want to master the fundamental arithmetic for data science or obtain an introduction to data science in Python.</p><p>You need not have any prior experience in data science to take up this course.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span>\n    In America as Empire, Jim Garrison urges us to face up to the complexities and responsibilities inherent in the indisputable fact that America is now the world's single preeminent power. \"America\", Garrison writes, \"has become what it was founded not to be: established as a haven for those fleeing the abuse of power, it has attained and now wields near absolute power. It has become an empire.\"<br/>Garrison traces the roots of the American empire to the very beginnings of the republic, in particular to the historic willingness of United States' to use military might in the defense of two consistent --- if sometimes contradictory --- foreign policy objectives: protection of American commercial interests and promotion of democracy.<br/>How long can the American empire last? Garrison looks at American history within the context of the rise and fall of empires and argues that the U. S. can gain important insights into durability from the Romans. He details the interplay between military power, political institutions, and legal structures that enabled the Roman empire at it's apogee to last for longer than America has as a country.<br/>But the real question is, what kind of empire can and should America be? As the sole superpower, America must lead in shaping a new global order, just as after World War II Roosevelt and Truman took the lead in shaping a new international order. That international order is now crumbling under the pressures of globalization, persistent poverty, terrorism and fundamentalism. Garrison outlines the kinds of cooperative global structures America must promote if its empire is to leave a lasting legacy of greatness. Garrison calls for Americans to consciously see themselves as a transitional empire, one whose task is not to dominate but to catalyze the next generation of global governance mechanisms that would make obsolete the need for empire. If this is done, America could be the final empire.\n  </span>",

This practical guide provides business analysts with an overview of various data wrangling techniques and tools, and puts the practice of data wrangling into context by asking, \"What are you trying to do and why?\"</p><p>Wrangling data consumes roughly 50-80% of an analyst’s time before any kind of analysis is possible. Written by key executives at Trifacta, this book walks you through the wrangling process by exploring several factors—time, granularity, scope, and structure—that you need to consider as you begin to work with data. You’ll learn a shared language and a comprehensive understanding of data wrangling, with an emphasis on recent agile analytic processes used by many of today’s data-driven organizations.</p><p>Appreciate the importance—and the satisfaction—of wrangling data the right way.</p><ul><li>Understand what kind of data is available</li><li>Choose which data to use and at what level of detail</li><li>Meaningfully combine multiple sources of data</li><li>Decide how to distill the results to a size and shape that can drive downstream analysis</li></ul></div></span></span>",

This book will show you how to assemble a data warehouse solution like a jigsaw puzzle by connecting specific Azure technologies that address your own needs and bring value to your business. You will see how to implement a range of architectural patterns using batches, events, and streams for both data lake technology and SQL databases. You will discover how to manage metadata and automation to accelerate the development of your warehouse while establishing resilience at every level. And you will know how to feed downstream analytic solutions such as Power BI and Azure Analysis Services to empower data-driven decision making that drives your business forward toward a pattern of success.</div><div><br/></div><div>This book teaches you how to employ the Azure platform in a strategy to dramatically improve implementation speed and flexibility of data warehousing systems. You will know how to make correct decisions in design, architecture, and infrastructure such as choosing which type of SQL engine (from at least three options) best meets the needs of your organization.

Just as there's an impedance mismatch between our databases, our ORMs, and our models, there's an equal mismatch between our applications, our APIs, and our clients. Pros and cons of this approach will be discussed, as well as why more people aren't building APIs this way yet.",

In this fast-paced and thorough discussion of how to plan for, implement, and run a successful data governance program, you'll get an overview of the ways data has been managed in the past and how the smart companies do it now. Along with an introduction to the operational frameworks used in data governance, Adler describes the roles of the Chief Data Officer and the Data Steward, outlines a set of commonly used policies and standards, and shows you how to build the business case for a data governance program. (If people in your company are suspicious of the term “data governance,\" you'll also learn some alternative terms many companies use to socialize and gain acceptance for their data governance programs.)  Watch this video and you’ll exit the data maze with a fundamental understanding of the origins, business goals, conceptual structure, and value of data governance.</p><ul><li>    Review the business and technology trends that drive the requirement for data governance</li><li>    Learn about the tools, technologies, and frameworks used in successful data governance programs</li><li> Understand the roles and responsibilities of the key players in data governance</li><li> Discover the best ways to plan, implement, and run a data governance program</li><li>    Understand the impact that agile development and Big Data collection technologies have on data governance</li></ul><p>John Adler, CRISC, PMP, MBA, runs the Data Management Group.

    "description": "<span><span><p><strong>20 Hours of Video Instruction</strong><br/><br/><strong>Data Science Fundamentals LiveLessons</strong> teaches you the foundational concepts, theory, and techniques you need to know to become an effective data scientist. The videos present you with applied, example-driven lessons in Python and its associated ecosystem of libraries, where you get your hands dirty with real datasets and see real results.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Description</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nIf nothing else, by the end of this video course you will have analyzed a number of datasets from the wild, built a handful of applications, and applied machine learning algorithms in meaningful ways to get real results. And along the way you learn the best practices and computational techniques used by a professional data scientist. More specifically, you learn how to acquire data that is openly accessible on the Internet by working with APIs. You learn how to parse XML and JSON data to load it into a relational database. </p><p>About the Instructor</p><p><strong>Jonathan Dinu</strong> is an author, researcher, and most importantly, an educator. He is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon's Human Computer Interaction Institute (HCII), where he is working to democratize machine learning and artificial intelligence through interpretable and interactive algorithms. Previously, he founded Zipfian Academy (an immersive data science training program acquired by Galvanize), has taught classes at the University of San Francisco, and has built a Data Visualization MOOC with Udacity. In addition to his professional data science experience, he has run data science trainings for a Fortune 500 company and taught workshops at Strata, PyData, and DataWeek (among others). He first discovered his love of all things data while studying Computer Science and Physics at UC Berkeley, and in a former life he worked for Alpine Data Labs developing distributed machine learning algorithms for predictive analytics on Hadoop.<br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan has always had a passion for sharing the things he has learned in the most creative ways he can. When he is not working with students, you can find him blogging about data, visualization, and education at <a href=\"http://hepm.pearsoned.com/hopelessoptimism.com\" target=\"\" title=\"\">hopelessoptimism.com</a> or rambling on Twitter @jonathandinu.</p><p><strong>Skill Level</strong></p><ul><li>Beginner</li></ul><strong>What You Will Learn</strong><br/><ul><li>How to get up and running with a Python data science environment</li><li>The essentials of Python 3, including object-oriented programming</li><li>The basics of the data science process and what each step entails</li><li>How to build a simple (yet powerful) recommendation engine for Airbnb listings</li><li>Where to find quality data sources and how to work with APIs programmatically</li><li>Strategies for parsing JSON and XML into a structured form</li><li>The basics of relational databases and how to use an ORM to interface with them in Python</li><li>Best practices of data validation, including common data quality checks</li></ul><strong>Who Should Take This Course</strong><br/><ul><li>Aspiring data scientists looking to break into the field and learn the essentials necessary</li><li>Journalists, consultants, analysts, or anyone else who works with data and looking to take a programmatic approach to exploring data and conducting analyses</li><li>Quantitative researchers interested in applying theory to real projects and taking a computational approach to modeling.</li><li>Software engineers interested in building intelligent applications driven by machine learning</li><li>Practicing data scientists already familiar with another programming environment looking to learn how to do data science with Python</li></ul><strong>Course Requirements</strong><br/><ul><li>Basic understanding of programming</li><li>Familiarity with Python and statistics are a plus</li></ul><strong>Lesson Descriptions</strong><br/><br/><strong>Lesson 1: Introduction to Data Science with Python</strong><br/><br/>\nLesson 1 begins with a working definition of data science (as we use it in the course), gives a brief history of the field, and provides motivating examples of data science products and applications. This lesson covers how to get set up with a data science programming environment locally, as well as gives you a crash course in the Python programming language if you are unfamiliar with it or are coming from another language such as R. Finally, it ends with an overview of the concepts and tools that the rest of the lessons cover to hopefully motivate you for and excite you about what's to come!<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 2: The Data Science Process—Building Your First Application</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nLesson 2 introduces the data science process by walking through an end-to-end example of building your very first data science application, an AirBnB listing recommender.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou continue to learn how to work with and manipulate data in Python, without any external libraries yet, and leverage the power of the built-in Python standard library. The core application of this lesson covers the basics of building a recommendation engine and shows you how, with simple statistics and a little ingenuity, you can build a compelling recommender, given the right data. And finally, it ends with a formal treatment of the data science process and the individual steps it entails.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 3: Acquiring Data—Sources and Methods</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nLesson 3 begins the treatment of each of the specific stages of the data science process, starting with the first: data acquisition. The lesson covers the basics of finding the appropriate data source for your problem and how to download the datasets you need once you have found them.<br/>\n<br/>\nStarting with an overview of how the infrastructure behind the Internet works, you learn how to programmatically make HTTP requests in Python to access data through APIs, as well as the basics of two of the most common data formats: JSON and XML. The lesson ends by setting up the dataset we use for the rest of the course: Foursquare Venues.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorking with the Foursquare dataset, you learn how to interact with APIs and do some minor web scraping. You also learn how to find and acquire data from a variety of sources and keep track of its lineage all along the way. You learn to put yourself in the data science mindset and how to see the data (hidden in plain sight) that we interact with every day.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 4: Adding Structure—Data Parsing and Storage</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nLesson 4 picks up with the second stage of what traditionally is referred to as an extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipeline, adding structure through the transformation of raw data.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou see how to work with a variety of data formats, including XML and JSON, by parsing the data we have acquired to eventually load it into an environment better-suited to exploration and analysis: a relational database. But before we load our data into a database, we take a short diversion to talk about how to conceptually model structure in data with code. You get a primer in object-oriented programming and learn how to leverage it to create abstractions and data models that define how you can interface with your data.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 5: Storing Data: Relational Databases (with SQLite)</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nLesson 5 starts with an introduction to one of the most ubiquitous data technologies—the relational database. The lesson serves as an end cap to the ETL pipeline of the previous videos. You learn the ins and outs of the various strategies for storing data and see how to map the abstractions you created in Python to database tables through the use of an object-relational mapper (ORM). By being able to query and manipulate data with Python while persisting data in a database reliably, the interface ORMs provide gives you the best of both worlds.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 6: Data Validation and Exploration<br/>\n</strong><br/>\nLesson 6 starts by showing you how to effectively query your data to understand what it contains, uncover any biases it might contain, and learn the best practices of dealing with missing values. After you have validated the quality of the data, you use descriptive statistics to learn how your data is distributed as well as learn the limits of point statistics (or rather single number estimates) and why it is often necessary to use visual techniques.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>About LiveLessons Video Training</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nThe LiveLessons Video Training series publishes hundreds of hands-on, expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.
