    "description": "<span><span><span><p><strong>9+ Hours of Video Instruction<br/>\n  <br/>\n  </strong><em>Large Scale Network Design LiveLessons</em> takes you through the concepts behind stable, scalable, elegant network design, including modularity, resilience, layering, and security principles. This livelesson will focus on traditional distributed link state, distance vector, and path vector routing protocols, as well as the basic principles of centralized control planes (such as OpenFlow). A special point will be made of sorting out the relationship between policy and reachability, and where they can best be managed in a large scale network.<strong><br/><br/></strong>This video begins with an examination of basic network design principles, including an examination of modularization, hierarchy, summarization, aggregation, and resilience. More advanced foundational topics are then considered, such as an overview of network complexity, network models, and policy from within the context of the control plane. After this, the series will work through design using each of the distributed control planes, including OSPF, IS-IS, EIGRP, and BGP, on several network topologies to provide practical knowledge of actual deployment in real networks. The following section of this livelesson will consider the tradeoffs around programmable networks, including convergence, stability, and other factors. Finally, advanced topics, such as fast convergence, will be considered in detail, from principle to application in each protocol.</p><p><strong>About the Instructors</strong></p><p><strong>Russ White</strong> has more than 20 years of experience in designing, deploying, breaking, and troubleshooting large-scale networks.

    "description": "<span><span><p><strong>Overview</strong></p><p>Configuration of Cisco devices (e.g. routers and switches) has traditionally been performed at the command line. However, an industry-wide paradigm shift is now underway, where more and more configuration is being performed by software, an approach commonly referred to as Software Defined Networking (SDN). SDN is an emerging architecture that is makes it easier and more cost-effective to implement network policies and manage network resources. It does this by decoupling the network control from the network hardware (which continues to manage forwarding functions), allowing network control to become directly programmable and the underlying network infrastructure to be managed by applications and network services rather than individually configured.</p><p>Network Programmability Fundamentals LiveLessons introduces the theory surrounding SDN networks and examines components found in a Cisco ACI network. Additionally, this course covers Python programming, a key skill required for network programmability. Finally, this course walks through multiple network programmability exercises, which can be performed (for free) at Cisco’s DevNet site.</p><p><strong>About the Instructor</strong></p><p>With Cisco experience dating back to 1989, Kevin Wallace, CCIEx2 (Collaboration and R/S) #7945 has been a network design specialist for the Walt Disney World Resort, an instructor of Cisco courses for Skillsoft, and a network manager for Eastern Kentucky University.

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>In the five years since the first edition of this classic book was  published, Internet use has exploded. The commercial world has rushed  headlong into doing business on the Web, often without integrating sound  security technologies and policies into their products and methods. The  security risks--and the need to protect both business and personal  data--have never been greater. We've updated <i>Building Internet  Firewalls</i> to address these newer risks.</p><p>What kinds of security threats does the Internet pose? Some, like  password attacks and the exploiting of known security holes, have been  around since the early days of networking. And others, like the  distributed denial of service attacks that crippled Yahoo, E-Bay, and  other major e-commerce sites in early 2000, are in current headlines.</p><p>Firewalls, critical components of today's computer networks,  effectively protect a system from most Internet security threats. They  keep damage on one part of the network--such as eavesdropping, a worm  program, or file damage--from spreading to the rest of the network.  Without firewalls, network security problems can rage out of control,  dragging more and more systems down.</p><p>Like the bestselling and highly respected first edition, <i>Building  Internet Firewalls,</i> 2nd Edition, is a practical and detailed  step-by-step guide to designing and installing firewalls and configuring  Internet services to work with a firewall. Much expanded to include  Linux and Windows coverage, the second edition describes:</p><ul><ul><li>Firewall technologies: packet filtering, proxying, network address  translation, virtual private networks</li><li>Architectures such as screening routers, dual-homed hosts, screened  hosts, screened subnets, perimeter networks, internal firewalls</li><li>Issues involved in a variety of new Internet services and protocols  through a firewall</li><li>Email and News </li><li>Web services and scripting languages (e.g., HTTP, Java, JavaScript,  ActiveX, RealAudio, RealVideo)</li><li>File transfer and sharing services such as NFS, Samba</li><li>Remote access services such as Telnet, the BSD \"r\" commands, SSH,  BackOrifice 2000 </li><li>Real-time conferencing services such as ICQ and talk </li><li>Naming and directory services (e.g., DNS, NetBT, the Windows Browser) </li><li>Authentication and auditing services (e.g., PAM, Kerberos, RADIUS); </li><li>Administrative services (e.g., syslog, SNMP, SMS, RIP and other  routing protocols, and ping and other network diagnostics) </li><li>Intermediary protocols (e.g., RPC, SMB, CORBA, IIOP)</li><li>Database protocols (e.g., ODBC, JDBC, and protocols for Oracle,  Sybase, and Microsoft SQL Server)</li></ul><p>The book's complete list of resources includes the location of many  publicly available firewall construction tools.</p></ul></div></span></span>",

    "title": "Network Security with OpenSSL",
    "description": "<span><span><p>Most applications these days are at least somewhat network aware, but how do you protect those applications against common network security threats?  Many developers are turning to OpenSSL, an open source version of SSL/TLS, which is the most widely used protocol for secure network communications.The OpenSSL library is seeing widespread adoption for web sites that require cryptographic functions to protect a broad range of sensitive information, such as credit card numbers and other financial transactions. The library is the only free, full-featured SSL implementation for C and C++,  and it can be used programmatically or from the command line to secure most TCP-based network protocols.<i>Network Security with OpenSSL</i> enables developers to use this protocol much more effectively. Traditionally, getting something simple done in OpenSSL could easily take weeks.   This concise book gives you the guidance you need to avoid pitfalls, while allowing you to take advantage of the library?s advanced features.   And, instead of bogging you down in the technical details of how SSL works under the hood, this book provides only the information that is necessary to use OpenSSL safely and effectively.  In step-by-step fashion, the book details the challenges in securing network communications, and shows you how to use OpenSSL tools to best meet those challenges.As a system or network administrator, you will benefit from the thorough treatment of the OpenSSL command-line interface, as well as from step-by-step directions for obtaining certificates and setting up your own certification authority.  As a developer, you will further benefit from the in-depth discussions and examples of how to use OpenSSL in your own programs.  Although OpenSSL is written in C, information on how to use OpenSSL with Perl, Python and PHP is also included.OpenSSL may well answer your need to protect sensitive data. If that?s the case, <i>Network Security with OpenSSL</i> is the only guide available on the subject.</p></span></span>",

With clear instructions and detailed screenshots, it helps you configure even the most advanced features.</p><li><p>Harness the power of pfSense's core functionality</p></li><li><p>Get under the hood to see how pfSense performs load balancing and failover</p></li><li><p>Detailed examples of interfaces, firewall rules, NAT port-forwarding, VPN services, and much, much more!</p></li><li><p>Full of illustrations, diagrams, and tips for making the most of any pfSense implementation using clear step-by-step instructions for relevant and practical examples</p></li><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>pfSense is an open source distribution of FreeBSD-based firewall that provides a platform for flexible and powerful routing and firewalling. The versatility of pfSense presents us with a wide array of configuration options, which makes determining requirements a little more difficult and a lot more important, compared to other offerings. Through this book you will see that pfSense offers numerous alternatives to fit any environment's security needs.</p><p>pfSense 2.0 Cookbook is the first and only book to explore all the features of pfSense, including those released in the latest 2.0 version. With the help of step-by-step instructions and detailed screenshots of the pfSense interface you will be able to configure every general and advanced feature from creating a firewall rule to configuring multi-WAN failover. Each recipe includes tips and offers advice on variations of the topic or references to other related recipes and additional information that can be found from other sources.</p><p>pfSense 2.0 Cookbook covers the gamut of available features and functionality. The first three chapters will take you from a non-existent system to a basic pfSense firewall. The next chapter focuses on configuring any number of the VPN services available, a very important and sought-after feature for anyone implementing a firewall. The following two chapters describe how to configure the most advanced features available in pfSense; features that may only be relevant to the most experienced network admins. Chapter 7 is dedicated to understanding and configuring the \"grab-bag\" of features that are available in pfSense, but are often stand-alone options and unrelated to each other. The first appendix explains how to use the status monitoring tools available for many of the features. The second appendix wraps up with helping you to decide how and where pfSense may be incorporated into your system and what type of hardware is required based on your throughput needs.</p><p>Over 70 simple but incredibly effective recipes for taking control of pfSense</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) provides a \"simple\" set of operations that allows you to more easily monitor and manage network devices like routers, switches, servers, printers, and more.  The information you can monitor with SNMP is wide-ranging--from standard items, like the amount of traffic flowing into an interface, to far more esoteric items, like the air temperature inside a router.  In spite of its name, though, SNMP is not especially simple to learn.</p><p>O'Reilly has answered the call for help with a practical introduction that shows how to install, configure, and manage SNMP.  Written for network and system administrators, the book introduces the basics of SNMP and then offers a technical background on how to use it effectively. <i>Essential SNMP</i> explores both commercial and open source packages, and elements like OIDs, MIBs, community strings, and traps are covered in depth.  The book contains five new chapters and various updates throughout. Other new topics include:</p><ul><li>Expanded coverage of SNMPv1, SNMPv2, and SNMPv3</li><li>Expanded coverage of SNMPc</li><li>The concepts behind network management and change management</li><li>RRDTool and Cricket</li><li>The use of scripts for a variety of tasks</li><li>How Java can be used to create SNMP applications</li><li>Net-SNMP's Perl module</li></ul><p>The bulk of the book is devoted to discussing, with real examples, how to use SNMP for system and network administration tasks. Administrators will come away with ideas for writing scripts to help them manage their networks, create managed objects, and extend the operation of SNMP agents.</p><p>Once demystified, SNMP is much more accessible. If you're looking for a way to more easily manage your network, look no further than <i>Essential SNMP, 2nd Edition</i>.</p></div></span>",

This updated book thoroughly covers the latest SSH-2 protocol for system administrators and end users interested in using this increasingly popular TCP/IP-based solution.How does it work? Whenever data is sent to the network, SSH automatically encrypts it. When data reaches its intended recipient, SSH decrypts it. The result is \"transparent\" encryption-users can work normally, unaware that their communications are already encrypted. SSH supports secure file transfer between computers, secure remote logins, and a unique \"tunneling\" capability that adds encryption to otherwise insecure network applications. With SSH, users can freely navigate the Internet, and system administrators can secure their networks or perform remote administration.Written for a wide, technical audience, <i>SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide</i> covers several implementations of SSH for different operating systems and computing environments. Whether you're an individual running Linux machines at home, a corporate network administrator with thousands of users, or a PC/Mac owner who just wants a secure way to telnet or transfer files between machines, our indispensable guide has you covered. It starts with simple installation and use of SSH, and works its way to in-depth case studies on large, sensitive computer networks.No matter where or how you're shipping information, <i>SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide</i> will show you how to do it securely.</p></span>",

A basic familiarity with networking concepts is assumed. Beginner-level knowledge of Rust will help but is not necessary.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Appreciate why networking is important in implementing distributed systems</li><li>Write a non-asynchronous echo server over TCP that talks to a client over a network</li><li>Parse JSON and binary data using parser combinators such as nom</li><li>Write an HTTP client that talks to the server using reqwest</li><li>Modify an existing Rust HTTTP server and add SSL to it</li><li>Master asynchronous programming support in Rust</li><li>Use external packages in a Rust project</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Rust is low-level enough to provide fine-grained control over memory while providing safety through compile-time validation. This makes it uniquely suitable for writing low-level networking applications.</p><p>This book is divided into three main parts that will take you on an exciting journey of building a fully functional web server. The book starts with a solid introduction to Rust and essential networking concepts. This will lay a foundation for, and set the tone of, the entire book. In the second part, we will take an in-depth look at using Rust for networking software. From client-server networking using sockets to IPv4/v6, DNS, TCP, UDP, you will also learn about serializing and deserializing data using serde. The book shows how to communicate with REST servers over HTTP. The final part of the book discusses asynchronous network programming using the Tokio stack. Given the importance of security for modern systems, you will see how Rust supports common primitives such as TLS and public-key cryptography.</p><p>After reading this book, you will be more than confident enough to use Rust to build effective networking software</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This book will get you started with building networking software in Rust by taking you through all the essential concepts. </p><p>Downloading the example code for this book You can download the example code files for all Packt books you have purchased from your account at http://www.PacktPub.com.

The best way to find out is to attack it. <em>Network Security Assessment</em> provides you with the tricks and tools professional security consultants use to identify and assess risks in Internet-based networks-the same penetration testing model they use to secure government, military, and commercial networks. With this book, you can adopt, refine, and reuse this testing model to design and deploy networks that are hardened and immune from attack.<br/><br/><em>Network Security Assessment</em> demonstrates how a determined attacker scours Internet-based networks in search of vulnerable components, from the network to the application level. This new edition is up-to-date on the latest hacking techniques, but rather than focus on individual issues, it looks at the bigger picture by grouping and analyzing threats at a high-level. By grouping threats in this way, you learn to create defensive strategies against entire attack categories, providing protection now and into the future.<br/><br/><em>Network Security Assessment</em> helps you assess:</p><ul><li>Web services, including Microsoft IIS, Apache, Tomcat, and subsystems such as OpenSSL, Microsoft FrontPage, and Outlook Web Access (OWA)</li><br/><br/><li>Web application technologies, including ASP, JSP, PHP, middleware, and backend databases such as MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server</li><br/><br/><li>Microsoft Windows networking components, including RPC, NetBIOS, and CIFS services</li><br/><br/><li>SMTP, POP3, and IMAP email services</li><br/><br/><li>IP services that provide secure inbound network access, including IPsec, Microsoft PPTP, and SSL VPNs</li><br/><br/><li>Unix RPC services on Linux, Solaris, IRIX, and other platforms</li><br/><br/><li>Various types of application-level vulnerabilities that hacker tools and scripts exploit</li><br/><br/></ul>Assessment is the first step any organization should take to start managing information risks correctly. With techniques to identify and assess risks in line with CESG CHECK and NSA IAM government standards, <em>Network Security Assessment</em> gives you a precise method to do just that.</div></span></span>",

So what exactly is Web 2.0 -- a marketing term or technical reality? This fascinating book finally puts substance behind the phenomenon by identifying the core patterns of Web 2.0, and by introducing an abstract model and reference architecture to help you take advantage of them.<br/><br/>In <em>Web 2.0 Architectures</em>, authors Duane Nickull, Dion Hinchcliffe, and James Governor -- who have 40 years of combined experience with technical specifications and industry trends -- examine what makes successful Web 2.0 services such as Google AdSense, Flickr, BitTorrent, MySpace, Facebook, and Wikipedia work. The result is a base of knowledge that developers, business people, futurists, and entrepreneurs can understand and use as a source of ideas and inspiration. <br/><br/>This book reveals:</p><p/><ul><li><b>A Web 2.0 model:</b> How the classic Client-Server model evolved into a more detailed Web 2.0 model.</li><br/><br/><li><b>Web 2.0 reference architecture:</b> A generic component view of basic Web 2.0 patterns that can be repurposed for other commercial ventures.</li><br/><br/><li><b>Specific Web 2.0 patterns:</b> How service oriented architecture (SOA), Software as a Service (SaaS), participation-collaboration, mashups, rich user experience, collaborative tagging systems (Folksonomy), and more can be used in your business.</li><br/><br/></ul><p>If you want to understand what makes Web 2.0 tick, and how it will enhance your business, <em>Web 2.0 Architectures</em> takes you right to the core.</p></div></span>",

It’s fast, scalable, and designed for high-performance networking and multiprocessing—in other words, it’s perfect for network programming.</p><p><i>Network Programming with Go</i> is for developers ready to start leveraging Go’s ease of use for writing secure, readable, production-ready network code. Early chapters establish a foundation of networking and traffic-routing know-how upon which the rest of the book builds. You’ll put that knowledge to use as author Adam Woodbeck guides you through writing programs that communicate using TCP, UDP, Unix sockets, and other features that ensure reliable data transmission. As you progress, you’ll explore higher-level network protocols like HTTP and HTTP/2, then build applications that securely interact with servers, clients, and APIs over a network using TLS.</p><p>In addition, Woodbeck shows you how to create a simple messaging protocol, develop tools for monitoring network traffic, craft a custom web server, and implement best practices for interacting with cloud providers using their SDKs. Along the way, you’ll learn:</p><p>•IP basics for writing effective network programs, such as IPv4 and IPv6 multicasting, ports, and network address translation<br/>•How to use handlers, middleware, and multiplexers to build capable HTTP-based applications with minimal code<br/>•The OSI and TCP/IP models for layered data architectures<br/>•Methods for reading data from/writing data to a network connection, like the type-length-value encoding scheme<br/>•Tools for incorporating authentication and encryption into your applications using TLS, like mutual authentication<br/>•How to serialize data for storage or transmission in Go-friendly formats like JSON, Gob, XML, and protocol buffers<br/>•How to Leverage Go’s code generation support to efficiently communicate with gRPC-based network services</p><p>So get ready to take advantage of Go’s built-in concurrency, rapid compiling, and rich standard library. Because when it comes to writing robust network programs, it’s Go time.</p></div></span>",

Content for titles in this program is made available throughout the development cycle, so products may not be complete, edited, or finalized, including video post-production editing.</p><p><strong>8+ Hours of Video Instruction</strong></p><p>This video considers the engineering problems to solve when transporting data from one device to another over a network and the solutions available for those problems. The presentation follows the pattern of the Recursive InterNetworking Architecture, or RINA, model, in breaking the problems down into marshaling, multiplexing, error handling, and flow control. For each of these four problems, a set of solutions is presented, such as marshaling grammars, addressing, forward error correction, and windowing. After the theoretical foundation is in place, several implementations are discussed to “fill out” the problems and solutions presented. The video also considers the problem of interlayer discovery—and some of the solutions available in this space—to provide a complete picture of data transport in a computer network.</p><p>Many engineers find themselves “sipping from the firehose,” trying to learn and understand a rapidly-changing set of technologies to solve ever-changing business requirements. The problems that need to be solved to carry data from one host to another, whether physical or virtual, however, were discovered early in the process of designing networks and protocols. The set of solutions to these problems, while expressed in a bewildering variety of products, technologies, and protocols, is also more constant that it might initially appear.</p><p>By learning the basic problems required to transport information across a network, and a common set of solutions to those problems, engineers can anticipate new technologies. New technologies are almost always a new implementation of some already known solution, designed to solve a problem that is already well-understood. By learning these common problems, and a range of solutions for each one, engineers can learn to ask the questions needed to quickly guide their learning in new technologies and products, as well as in quickly understanding where any solutions may face implementation or theoretical problems.</p><p><strong>About the Instructors</strong></p><p><strong>Russ White</strong> began working with computers in the mid-1980s, and computer networks in 1990. He has experience in designing, deploying, breaking, and troubleshooting large scale networks, and is a strong communicator from the whiteboard to the board room. Across that time, he has co-authored more than forty software patents, participated in the development of several Internet standards, helped develop the CCDE and the CCAr, and worked in Internet governance with the Internet Society.

Anyone wishing to take the CCNA CyberOps exam would also benefit from viewing this course.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Course Requirements</strong>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nThe video course assumes that the learner has the skills to navigate the user interface of a PC running on Microsoft Window, Mac, or Linux and who has completed typical high school-level math courses (mainly that the reader has been exposed to binary math). The course also assumes that the reader has used PCs connected to either a home network or a network inside a school or company, but that the reader might not understand anything about the network to which the PC was connected. It is also assumed that the reader knows how to use typical Internet applications, primarily web browsers, and email clients.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson Descriptions</strong>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nModule 1, “Security Concepts,” covers the cybersecurity fundamentals, including the CIA Triad, comparing the various security deployments, understanding threat intelligence, malware analysis tools, RBA, and reverse engineering. It then moves into more in-depth concepts such as risk assessment, threats, vulnerabilities, and exploits. The module gets into the details of the access control process and the various types of attacks and vulnerabilities. The last lesson in Module 1 digs into the fundamentals of cryptography and the Public Key Infrastructure, or PKI. The encryption and hashing algorithms are explained, as well as the secure socket layer and digital certificates.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nModule 2, “Security Monitoring,” starts with the fundamentals: data normalization and the 5-tuple correlation, as well as DNS, weblog, deterministic, and probabilistic analysis. NetFlow as it specifically applies to cybersecurity and incident response is introduced in this module, as well as its various analysis tools. You will learn how to identify the different intrusion event categories, and gain an understanding of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Framework.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nModule 3, “Host-based Analysis,” gets into the details of digital forensics, including types of evidence and the chain of custody. It then details more of the host-based forensics of Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX. This module finishes with a discussion of endpoint security technologies, including firewalls, antimalware, antivirus, and systems-based sandboxing.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nModule 4, “Network Intrusion Analysis,” digs into the various ways to determine whether your system has been attacked, from examining packet captures and protocol headers, to monitoring traffic, and differentiating between true and false negatives. Module 4 will walk you through all the details.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nModule 5, “Security Policies and Procedures,” covers the security management side of security, including the management of assets, configuration, mobile devices, patches, and vulnerabilities, as well as explaining PII and PHI. The next lesson covers the fundamentals of incident response, including the scope of the plan and processes, how to share information and coordinate with partners, whether your company aligns with the NIST IR categories, and the structures of the incident response teams. Lastly, this module introduces the VERIS Schema and how it applies to incident response.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>About Pearson Video Training</strong>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nPearson publishes expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

    "description": "<span><div><p>Construct, analyze, and visualize networks with networkx, a Python language module. Network analysis is a powerful tool you can apply to a multitude of datasets and situations. Discover how to work with all kinds of networks, including social, product, temporal, spatial, and semantic networks. Convert almost any real-world data into a complex network--such as recommendations on co-using cosmetic products, muddy hedge fund connections, and online friendships. Analyze and visualize the network, and make business decisions based on your analysis. If you're a curious Python programmer, a data scientist, or a CNA specialist interested in mechanizing mundane tasks, you'll increase your productivity exponentially.</p><p>Complex network analysis used to be done by hand or with non-programmable network analysis tools, but not anymore! You can now automate and program these tasks in Python. Complex networks are collections of connected items, words, concepts, or people. By exploring their structure and individual elements, we can learn about their meaning, evolution, and resilience.</p><p>Starting with simple networks, convert real-life and synthetic network graphs into networkx data structures. Look at more sophisticated networks and learn more powerful machinery to handle centrality calculation, blockmodeling, and clique and community detection. Get familiar with presentation-quality network visualization tools, both programmable and interactive--such as Gephi, a CNA explorer. Adapt the patterns from the case studies to your problems. Explore big networks with NetworKit, a high-performance networkx substitute. Each part in the book gives you an overview of a class of networks, includes a practical study of networkx functions and techniques, and concludes with case studies from various fields, including social networking, anthropology, marketing, and sports analytics.</p><p>Combine your CNA and Python programming skills to become a better network analyst, a more accomplished data scientist, and a more versatile programmer.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>You will need a Python 3.x installation with the following additional modules: Pandas (&gt;=0.18), NumPy (&gt;=1.10), matplotlib (&gt;=1.5), networkx (&gt;=1.11), python-louvain (&gt;=0.5), NetworKit (&gt;=3.6), and generalizesimilarity. We recommend using the Anaconda distribution that comes with all these modules, except for python-louvain, NetworKit, and generalizedsimilarity, and works on all major modern operating systems.</p></div></span>",

This is\nnecessary due to increased attack frequency, diverse attack\nsophistication, and the rapid nature of attack velocity—all\nblurring the boundaries between the network and perimeter.</p><p><em>End-to-End Network Security</em> is\ndesigned to counter the new generation of complex threats. Adopting\nthis robust security strategy defends against highly sophisticated\nattacks that can occur at multiple locations in your network. The\nultimate goal is to deploy a set of security capabilities that\ntogether create an intelligent, self-defending network that\nidentifies attacks as they occur, generates alerts as appropriate,\nand then automatically responds.</p><p><em>End-to-End Network Security</em> provides\nyou with a comprehensive look at the mechanisms to counter threats\nto each part of your network. The book starts with a review of\nnetwork security technologies then covers the six-step methodology\nfor incident response and best practices from proactive security\nframeworks. Later chapters cover wireless network security, IP\ntelephony security, data center security, and IPv6 security.\nFinally, several case studies representing small, medium, and large\nenterprises provide detailed example configurations and\nimplementation strategies of best practices learned in earlier\nchapters.</p><p>Adopting the techniques and strategies\noutlined in this book enables you to prevent day-zero attacks,\nimprove your overall security posture, build strong policies, and\ndeploy intelligent, self-defending networks.</p><p>“Within these pages, you will find\nmany practical tools, both process related and technology related,\nthat you can draw on to improve your risk mitigation\nstrategies.”</p><p>—Bruce Murphy, Vice President, World\nWide Security Practices, Cisco</p><p>Omar Santos is a senior network security\nengineer at Cisco®.

    "description": "<span><span><p>When it comes to network security, many users and administrators are running scared, and justifiably so.  The sophistication of attacks against computer systems increases with each new Internet worm.What's the worst an attacker can do to you?  You'd better find out, right?  That's what <i>Security Warrior</i> teaches you.  Based on the principle that the only way to defend yourself is to understand your attacker in depth, <i>Security Warrior</i> reveals how your systems can be attacked.  Covering everything from reverse engineering to SQL attacks, and including topics like social engineering, antiforensics, and common attacks against UNIX and Windows systems, this book teaches you to know your enemy and how to be prepared to do battle.<i>Security Warrior</i> places particular emphasis on reverse engineering.  RE is a fundamental skill for the administrator, who must be aware of all kinds of malware that can be installed on his machines -- trojaned binaries, \"spyware\" that looks innocuous but that sends private data back to its creator, and more.  This is the only book to discuss reverse engineering for Linux or Windows CE.  It's also the only book that shows you how SQL injection works, enabling you to inspect your database and web applications for vulnerability.<i>Security Warrior</i> is the most comprehensive and up-to-date book covering the art of computer war: attacks against computer systems and their defenses.

    "description": "<span><p/><p>In this 100-page book, you will find that Stripes provides a very simple learning path, where you do not need to understand the entire framework in order to use it. The concept of this book is exactly that – to get you using the framework and writing code immediately. You will be off and running in no time, and adding to your skill set as we progress.</p><p>This book is written with exactly that learning method in mind. No filler, no empty explanations... just code. You won't be driving solo, however. Each code example is heavily annotated with comments and tips, so that you not only understand each snippet, but can also dive deeper if you so choose.</p><p>Stripes is a web framework for the Java programming language. It was initially released in 2005 by Tim Fennell. Despite its growth and maturity, Stripes has always focused on two key principles: simplicity and ease of development. Stripes has also remained a solution for a single application tier: the web-layer. Its purpose is to handle the interaction between a web browser and server-side java code. To tie these concepts together Stripes makes heavy use of Java annotations, which we will see as we learn the various features of Stripes.</p></span>",

    "title": "Hardening Cisco Routers",
    "description": "<span><span><div><p>As a network administrator, auditor or architect, you know the importance of securing your network and finding security solutions you can implement quickly.  This succinct book departs from other security literature by focusing exclusively on ways to secure Cisco routers, rather than the entire network. The rational is simple: If the router protecting a network is exposed to hackers, then so is the network behind it. <i>Hardening Cisco Routers</i> is a reference for protecting the protectors. Included are the following topics:</p><ul><li type=\"?disc?\">The importance of router security and where routers fit into an overall security plan</li><li type=\"?disc?\">Different router configurations for various versions of Cisco?s IOS</li><li type=\"?disc?\">Standard ways to access a Cisco router and the security implications of each</li><li type=\"?disc?\">Password and privilege levels in Cisco routers</li><li type=\"?disc?\">Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) control</li><li type=\"?disc?\">Router warning banner use (as recommended by the FBI) </li><li type=\"?disc?\">Unnecessary protocols and services commonly run on Cisco routers</li><li type=\"?disc?\">SNMP security</li><li type=\"?disc?\">Anti-spoofing</li><li type=\"?disc?\">Protocol security for RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, NTP, and BGP</li><li type=\"?disc?\">Logging violations</li><li type=\"?disc?\">Incident response</li><li type=\"?disc?\">Physical security</li></ul>Written by Thomas Akin, an experienced Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) and Certified Cisco Academic Instructor (CCAI), the book is well organized, emphasizing practicality and a hands-on approach. At the end of each chapter, Akin includes a Checklist that summarizes the hardening techniques discussed in the chapter.  The Checklists help you double-check the configurations you have been instructed to make, and serve as quick references for future security procedures.Concise and to the point, <i>Hardening Cisco Routers</i> supplies you with all the tools necessary to turn a potential vulnerability into a strength.  In an area that is otherwise poorly documented, this is the one book that will help you make your Cisco routers rock solid.</div></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Explore the rise of SD-WAN with CISCO and transform your existing WAN into an agile, efficient, and cost-effective network.</p><p><i><b>Learning SD-WAN with Cisco</b></i> helps you understand the development of SD-WAN and its benefits to modern networks. This book starts with an exploration of the different components of SD-WAN, such as vBond for orchestration, vManage for management, vSmart for control, and the vEdge devices. From there, it moves on to building a network from the ground up using EVE-NG, focusing on how to install EVE-NG, get the required licenses via a SmartNET account, download the components, and begin to create your network by installing vManage.</p><p>Once you have this foundation, you will create the organization and certificates, and look at local users as well as single- and multi-tenancy options and clustering. As you continue to build your network, you will dig down into the overlay protocols used in SD-WAN, and then deploy your controllers and edge devices, looking at zero-touch provisioning along the way.</p><p>After building your network, you will configure and apply policies and templates to manage the control and data planes as well as VPNs, Internet access, security, and quality of service. The book also explores reporting and management using vManage, along with upgrading and troubleshooting the various components, using techniques from simple ping and trace route through to advanced techniques such as DTLS and TLOC troubleshooting and traffic simulation.</p><p>After reading this book, you will have hands-on experience working with SD-WAN. You will understand how to deploy, configure, manage, and troubleshoot it.</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><p></p><ul><li>Know what SD-WAN is, how it came about, and why we need it</li><li>Understand troubleshooting and traffic simulation of DTLS and TLOC </li><li>Monitor, report, and troubleshoot the SD-WAN environment</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Who This Book Is For </b></p><p> </p>Network professionals with experience in Linux and Cisco devices<p></p><p><br/></p><p> </p></span>",

An SBOM is a critical cybersecurity component to keep track and catalog what is installed (and at what versions) in production environments. With recent cybersecurity threats, SBOMs play an important role to implement a remediation strategy when threats and vulnerabilities are reported. Without an SBOM, it is borderline impossible to detect what exactly is released into production, and what may be vulnerable today.\n<br/>\nTopics include:\n<br/>\n* Understand the concepts behind an SBOM\n<br/>\n* Create an SBOM and use different output formats like CycloneDX to import into other systems\n<br/>\n* Use an SBOM to detect CVE and other vulnerabilities associated with installed software\n<br/>\n* Capture information about pre-installed system dependencies and nested dependencies\n<br/>\n* Use CycloneDX and other machine-readable formats like JSON to import outputs into other systems\n<br/>\n\nA few resources that are helpful if you are trying to get started with SBOMs, generating them and using them to capture vulnerabilities:\n\n<br/>\n* A simple, user-friendly SBOM generator: <a href=\"https://github.com/anchore/syft/\">Syft</a>\n<br/>\n* A fast vulnerability matcher that uses SBOMs as input: <a href=\"https://github.com/anchore/grype\">Grype</a>\n<br/>\n* <a href=\"https://cyclonedx.org/\">The CycloneDX format</a>\n</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p><em/></p><p>This book is a one-stop desk reference and synopsis of basic knowledge and skills for Cisco certification preparation. For beginning and experienced network engineers tasked with building LAN, WAN, and data center connections, this book lays out clear directions for installing, configuring, and troubleshooting networks with Cisco devices. The full range of certification topics is covered, including all aspects of IOS, NX-OS, and ASA software. The emphasis throughout is on solving the real-world challenges engineers face in configuring network devices, rather than on exhaustive descriptions of hardware features.</p><p>This practical desk companion doubles as a comprehensive overview of the basic knowledge and skills needed by CCENT, CCNA, and CCNP exam takers. It distills a comprehensive library of cheat sheets, lab configurations, and advanced commands that the authors assembled as senior network engineers for the benefit of junior engineers they train, mentor on the job, and prepare for Cisco certification exams. Prior familiarity with Cisco routing and switching is desirable but not necessary, as Chris Carthern, Dr. Will Wilson, Noel Rivera, and Richard Bedwell start their book with a review of the basics of configuring routers and switches. All the more advanced chapters have labs and exercises to reinforce the concepts learned. </p><p>This book differentiates itself from other Cisco books on the market by approaching network security from a hacker’s perspective. Not only does it provide network security recommendations but it teaches you how to use black-hat tools such as oclHashcat, Loki, Burp Suite, Scapy, Metasploit, and Kali to actually test the security concepts learned. </p></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><span><p><b>Detect fraud earlier to mitigate loss and prevent cascading damage</b></p><p><em>Fraud Analytics Using Descriptive, Predictive, and Social Network Techniques</em> is an authoritative guidebook for setting up a comprehensive fraud detection analytics solution. Early detection is a key factor in mitigating fraud damage, but it involves more specialized techniques than detecting fraud at the more advanced stages. This invaluable guide details both the theory and technical aspects of these techniques, and provides expert insight into streamlining implementation. Coverage includes data gathering, preprocessing, model building, and post-implementation, with comprehensive guidance on various learning techniques and the data types utilized by each. These techniques are effective for fraud detection across industry boundaries, including applications in insurance fraud, credit card fraud, anti-money laundering, healthcare fraud, telecommunications fraud, click fraud, tax evasion, and more, giving you a highly practical framework for fraud prevention.</p><p>It is estimated that a typical organization loses about 5% of its revenue to fraud every year. More effective fraud detection is possible, and this book describes the various analytical techniques your organization must implement to put a stop to the revenue leak.</p><li><p>Examine fraud patterns in historical data</p></li><li><p>Utilize labeled, unlabeled, and networked data</p></li><li><p>Detect fraud before the damage cascades</p></li><li><p>Reduce losses, increase recovery, and tighten security</p></li><p>The longer fraud is allowed to go on, the more harm it causes. It expands exponentially, sending ripples of damage throughout the organization, and becomes more and more complex to track, stop, and reverse. Fraud prevention relies on early and effective fraud detection, enabled by the techniques discussed here. <em>Fraud Analytics Using Descriptive, Predictive, and Social Network Techniques</em> helps you stop fraud in its tracks, and eliminate the opportunities for future occurrence.</p></span></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>With the large number of high-profile incidents in the last few years, you’ve likely heard of ransomware attacks—a type of cybercrime where hackers use malware to encrypt network files, locking users out of the system until a ransom is paid. Within hours, a thriving business can completely lose access to its sensitive data. Business solutions company Tools &amp; Solutions survived a ransomware attack. Then, to prevent future attacks from succeeding, the company updated internal guidance, identified and documented vulnerabilities, and reviewed its backup strategy while critically aligning key stakeholders.</p><p>Join us for this Case Study with security pro Partha Majumdar to explore the steps Tools &amp; Solutions took following their ransomware incident and learn how to prevent ransomware attacks using a layered approach that combines security defenses with proactive measures to stop ransomware from taking hold in the first place. And if you run a distributed cloud system, you’ll get tips for your overall security strategy and specific techniques that will help you implement preventative, detective, incident response, and recovery controls.</p><p>Recorded on November 23, 2021.

    "title": "Introducing Robotic Process Automation to Your Organization: A Guide for Business Leaders",
    "description": "<span><div>For your robotic process automation (RPA) program to be successful, you need to follow a general framework and governance model. This book covers, in detail, what they should look like and how to adapt them to your organization.</div><div><br/></div><i><b>Introducing Robotic Process Automation to Your Organization</b></i> is structured to enable you, a novice to RPA, to successfully implement an RPA program at your company. RPA is rapidly growing in use, but is only starting to be taught at a university level. Many mid-level managers will be tasked with introducing an RPA program at their organizations as senior management learns of its efficacy, but will be unfamiliar with how to do so. This book provides you with the skills and information you need to make an informed decision. <div><br/></div><div>​For decades, there has been much discussion about the fast pace of technology, the rapidly changing technology environment, and the need for companies to be on the cutting edge to remain competitive or even relevant. In this ever-changing environment, there is a need to know what can be done in terms of current processes, here and now, that will increase efficiency, benefit customers, and improve profitability. One option is RPA.<div><div><br/></div><div>This book includes information to assist you in getting the required buy-in and identifying the first few processes for automation. A structure for identifying opportunities on an ongoing basis is detailed, along with concepts that must be considered for solution design and deployment. Throughout the book there are several \"pause and consider\" statements to help you think about how principles pertain to your organization. Additionally, there are tips included that offer short, concrete suggestions on how to help implement the particular step being discussed.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></div><div><b>What You Will Learn</b></div><div><div><ul><li>Know the benefits of robotic process automation (RPA)</li><li>Understand the limitations of RPA</li><li>Ask the right questions to determine whether a process is a good candidate for automation</li><li>Obtain buy-in from skeptics at the senior and middle manager levels, and from line workers</li><li>Be familiar with the structure required for success</li></ul></div><div><br/></div><div><b>Who This Book is For</b><br/></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><div>Middle managers who have either identified the need for robotic process automation (RPA) in their organization or have been directed by senior management to explore the possibility of introducing RPA to their organization; managers at all levels who hear about RPA, either through conferences, professional associations, or industry publications, and want to know more; students of business and technology who wish to broaden their understanding of important current trends.</div></div></div></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><strong>Countering Cyber Sabotage: Introducing Consequence-Driven, Cyber-Informed Engineering (CCE)</strong> introduces a new methodology to help critical infrastructure owners, operators and their security practitioners make demonstrable improvements in securing their most important functions and processes.  </p><p>Current best practice approaches to cyber defense struggle to stop targeted attackers from creating potentially catastrophic results. From a national security perspective, it is not just the damage to the military, the economy, or essential critical infrastructure companies that is a concern. It is the cumulative, downstream effects from potential regional blackouts, military mission kills, transportation stoppages, water delivery or treatment issues, and so on. CCE is a validation that engineering first principles can be applied to the most important cybersecurity challenges and in so doing, protect organizations in ways current approaches do not. The most pressing threat is cyber-enabled sabotage, and CCE begins with the assumption that well-resourced, adaptive adversaries are already in and have been for some time, undetected and perhaps undetectable. </p><p>Chapter 1 recaps the current and near-future states of digital technologies in critical infrastructure and the implications of our near-total dependence on them. Chapters 2 and 3 describe the origins of the methodology and set the stage for the more in-depth examination that follows. Chapter 4 describes how to prepare for an engagement, and chapters 5-8 address each of the four phases. The CCE phase chapters take the reader on a more granular walkthrough of the methodology with examples from the field, phase objectives, and the steps to take in each phase. Concluding chapter 9 covers training options and looks towards a future where these concepts are scaled more broadly. </p><p></p></span>",

When network intrusions do occur, it’s imperative that a thorough and systematic analysis and investigation of the attack is conducted to determine the nature of the threat and the extent of information lost, stolen, or damaged during the attack. A thorough and timely investigation and response can serve to minimize network downtime and ensure that critical business systems are maintained in full operation.</p><p><i>Network Intrusion Analysis</i> teaches the reader about the various tools and techniques to use during a network intrusion investigation. The book focuses on the methodology of an attack as well as the investigative methodology, challenges, and concerns. This is the first book that provides such a thorough analysis of network intrusion investigation and response.</p><p><i>Network Intrusion Analysis</i> addresses the entire process of investigating a network intrusion by: *Providing a step-by-step guide to the tools and techniques used in the analysis and investigation of a network intrusion. *Providing real-world examples of network intrusions, along with associated workarounds. *Walking you through the methodology and practical steps needed to conduct a thorough intrusion investigation and incident response, including a wealth of practical, hands-on tools for incident assessment and mitigation.</p><ul><i><li>Network Intrusion Analysis</li></i> addresses the entire process of investigating a network intrusion <li>Provides a step-by-step guide to the tools and techniques used in the analysis and investigation of a network intrusion</li> <li>Provides real-world examples of network intrusions, along with associated workarounds</li> <li>Walks readers through the methodology and practical steps needed to conduct a thorough intrusion investigation and incident response, including a wealth of practical, hands-on tools for incident assessment and mitigation</li></ul></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><div id=\"_mcePaste\" style=\"position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;\">Previous studies have looked at the contribution of information technology and network theory to the art of warfare as understood in the broader sense. This book, however, focuses on an area particularly important in understanding the significance of the information revolution; its impact on strategic theory</div><div id=\"_mcePaste\" style=\"position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;\">The purpose of the book is to critically analyze the contributions and challenges that the spread of information technologies can bring to categories of classic strategic theory. In the first two chapters, the author establishes the context of the book, coming back to the epistemology of revolution in military affairs and its terminology. The third chapter examines the political bases of strategic action and operational strategy, before the next two chapters focus on historical construction of the process of getting to know your opponents and the way in which we consider information collection. Chapter 6 returns to the process of “informationalization” in the doctrine of armed forces, especially in Western countries, and methods of conducting network-centric warfare. The final chapter looks at the attempts of Western countries to adapt to the emergence of techno-guerrillas and new forms of hybrid warfare, and the resulting socio-strategic outcomes.</div><div> Previous studies have looked at the contribution of information technology and network theory to the art of warfare as understood in the broader sense. This book, however, focuses on an area particularly important in understanding the significance of the information revolution; its impact on strategic theory. The purpose of the book is to critically analyze the contributions and challenges that the spread of information technologies can bring to categories of classic strategic theory. In the first two chapters, the author establishes the context of the book, coming back to the epistemology of revolution in military affairs and its terminology. The third chapter examines the political bases of strategic action and operational strategy, before the next two chapters focus on historical construction of the process of getting to know your opponents and the way in which we consider information collection. Chapter 6 returns to the process of “informationalization” in the doctrine of armed forces, especially in Western countries, and methods of conducting network-centric warfare.

    "description": "<span><p>The attacks on computers and business networks are growing daily, and the need for security professionals who understand how malfeasants perform attacks and compromise networks is a growing requirement to counter the threat. Network security education generally lacks appropriate textbooks with detailed, hands-on exercises that include both offensive and defensive techniques. Using step-by-step processes to build and generate attacks using offensive techniques, Network Attacks and Defenses: A Hands-on Approach enables students to implement appropriate network security solutions within a laboratory environment. Topics covered in the labs include: Content Addressable Memory (CAM) table poisoning attacks on network switches Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache poisoning attacks The detection and prevention of abnormal ARP traffic Network traffic sniffing and the detection of Network Interface Cards (NICs) running in promiscuous mode Internet Protocol-Based Denial-of-Service (IP-based DoS) attacks Reconnaissance traffic Network traffic filtering and inspection Common mechanisms used for router security and device hardening Internet Protocol Security Virtual Private Network (IPsec VPN) security solution protocols, standards, types, and deployments Remote Access IPsec VPN security solution architecture and its design, components, architecture, and implementations These practical exercises go beyond theory to allow students to better anatomize and elaborate offensive and defensive techniques. Educators can use the model scenarios described in this book to design and implement innovative hands-on security exercises. Students who master the techniques in this book will be well armed to counter a broad range of network security threats.</p></span>",

Most all IT assets of an\norganization share a common network infrastructure. Therefore, the\nfirst line of defense is to establish proper network security. This\nsecurity is a prerequisite for a logical set of technical\ncountermeasures to protect from many different attack vectors that\nuse the network to infiltrate the backbone of an organization.</p><p>The IBM® Security Network Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)\nstops network-based threats before they can impact the business\noperations of an organization. Preemptive protection, which is\nprotection that works ahead of a threat, is available by means of a\ncombination of line-speed performance, security intelligence, and a\nmodular protection engine that enables security convergence. By\nconsolidating network security demands for data security and\nprotection for web applications, the IBM Security Network IPS\nserves as the security platform that can reduce the costs and\ncomplexity of deploying and managing point solutions.</p><p>This IBM Redbooks® publication provides IT architects and\nsecurity specialists a better understanding of the challenging\ntopic of blocking network threats. This book highlights security\nconvergence of IBM Virtual Patch® technology, data security,\nand Web Application Protection. In addition, this book explores the\ntechnical foundation of the IBM Security Network IPS. It explains\nhow to set up, configure, and maintain proper network perimeter\nprotection within a real-world business scenario.</p></span>",

The key idea of emulation is to reproduce in real time and in a controlled manner the essential functionality of a system, so that it can interact with other real systems that can thus be evaluated. This book describes the technique of network emulation and compares it with the other experimental approaches: the scholarly analytical modeling, the popular network simulation, and the demanding real-world testing. To emphasize the practical aspects related to emulation, this book presents a large number of examples of network emulators on the market, as well as provides an in-depth analysis of a case study, the wireless network emulation testbed called QOMB.</p></span></span>",

This book pinpoints the most dangerous hacks and exploits specific to networks, laying out the anatomy of these attacks including how to make your system more secure. You will discover the best ways to defend against these vicious hacks with step-by-step instruction and learn techniques to make your computer and network impenetrable.</p><p>The book consists of seven chapters that deal with the following attacks: denial of service; war dialing; penetration testing; protocol tunneling; spanning tree attacks; man-in-the-middle; and password replay. These attacks are not mutually exclusive and were chosen because they help illustrate different aspects of network security. The principles on which they rely are unlikely to vanish any time soon, and they allow for the possibility of gaining something of interest to the attacker, from money to high-value data. This book is intended to provide practical, usable information. However, the world of network security is evolving very rapidly, and the attack that works today may (hopefully) not work tomorrow. It is more important, then, to understand the principles on which the attacks and exploits are based in order to properly plan either a network attack or a network defense.</p><p><i>Seven Deadliest Network Attacks</i> will appeal to information security professionals of all levels, network admins, and recreational hackers.</p><ul><li>Knowledge is power, find out about the most dominant attacks currently waging war on computers and networks globally</li><li>Discover the best ways to defend against these vicious attacks; step-by-step instruction shows you how</li><li>Institute countermeasures, don’t be caught defenseless again, and learn techniques to make your computer and network impenetrable </li></ul></span>",

Unfortunately, attackers have grown more nimble and effective, meaning that traditional security programs are no longer effective.</p><p>Today's effective cyber security programs take these best practices and overlay them with intelligence. Adding cyber threat intelligence can help security teams uncover events not detected by traditional security platforms and correlate seemingly disparate events across the network. Properly-implemented intelligence also makes the life of the security practitioner easier by helping him more effectively prioritize and respond to security incidents.</p><p>The problem with current efforts is that many security practitioners don't know how to properly implement an intelligence-led program, or are afraid that it is out of their budget. <b><i>Building an Intelligence-Led Security Program</i></b> is the first book to show how to implement an intelligence-led program in your enterprise on any budget. It will show you how to implement a security information a security information and event management system, collect and analyze logs, and how to practice real cyber threat intelligence.

    "title": "Developing a Poly-Chronic Care Network",
    "description": "<span><p>Although much has been achieved in care coordination and accountable care, healthcare leaders need additional, game-changing innovations to deal with constraints in clinical resources, care capacity, and cost that have not yet been fully addressed. This need for innovation is especially great in the care of the chronically ill: the most costly, highest-risk segments of our populations.<br/><br/>Filling this void, <strong>Developing a Poly-Chronic Care Network: An Engineered, Community-Wide Approach to Disease Management </strong>reconstructs and augments traditional chronic care delivery models. The proposed solution—the Poly-Chronic Care Network© (PCCN)—is a specific iteration of the Care Circle Network© (CCN) concept that creates a sustainable community-engaging response to the complexity, cost, and outcomes of chronic diseases. By dynamically engineering all the elements of a community’s \"Capacity to Care\" directly into short- and long-term patient care processes, the PCCN expands care capacity and physician \"reach\", and improves quality and outcomes, without increasing the total cost of care.<br/><br/>The book describes the fundamental concepts, principles, and requirements for the PCCN and explains how this care model could augment and enhance other new business models, such as Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) and Patient-Centered Medical Homes (PCMHs). In addition to a detailed description of implementation steps and organizational structures, the text provides useful insights into technologies that can aid and enhance implementation, including home/virtual monitoring, social networking, and dynamic simulation. Importantly, the book includes both detailed examples and a flexible how-to guide for setting up a PCCN or other CCN, offering readers step-by-step guidelines and options for combining readily-available communal resources with simple technologies in the design of innovative care models for their communities.<br/><br/>With this book in hand, readers can confidently pick and choose specific components to match their community’s needs and capabilities, \"amending the blend\" to account for the size, scale, scope, and population of the community and patients they wish to serve.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>\nTo the uninitiated, the title may seem like an oxymoron: after all,\naren't hacks what network security is supposed to prevent? But if\nyou're network administrator, this book's title not only makes\nsense; it makes a lot of sense. You know that a busy administrator\nneeds a hatful of devilishly effective security hacks to keep your\n12-hour days from becoming all-nighters. <em>Network Security\nHacks</em> is not a long-winded treatise on security theory.\nInstead, this information packed little book provides 100 quick,\npractical, and clever things to do to help make your Linux, UNIX,\nor Windows networks more secure today. This compendium of security\nhacks doesn't just cover securing TCP/IP-based services, but also\nprovides intelligent host-based security techniques. Loaded with\nconcise but powerful examples of applied encryption, intrusion\ndetection, logging, trending, and incident response, <em>Network\nSecurity Hacks</em> will demonstrate effective methods for defending\nyour servers and networks from a variety of devious and subtle\nattacks. <em>Network Security Hacks</em> show how to detect the\npresence (and track every keystroke) of network intruders, methods\nfor protecting your network and data using strong encryption, and\neven techniques for laying traps for would-be system crackers.\nImportant security tools are presented, as well as clever methods\nfor using them to reveal real, timely, useful information about\nwhat is happening on your network. O'Reilly's Hacks Series reclaims\nthe term \"hacking\" for the good guys--innovators who use their\ningenuity to solve interesting problems, explore and experiment,\nunearth shortcuts, and create useful tools. <em>Network Security\nHacks</em> lives up to reputation the Hacks series has earned by\nproviding the \"roll-up-your sleeves and get-it-done\" hacks that\nmost network security tomes don't offer. Every hack can be read in\njust a few minutes but will save hours of searching for the right\nanswer. Using just one of these amazing hacks will make this slim\nbook's price seem like a remarkable deal. The other 99 make\n<em>Network Security Hacks</em> absolutely invaluable.\n</p></span></span>",

Business case studies and real world vulnerabilities are used through the book. It starts by introducing the reader to the concepts of a vulnerability management system. Readers will be provided detailed timelines of exploit development, vendors’ time to patch, and corporate path installations. Next, the differences between security assessment s and penetration tests will be clearly explained along with best practices for conducting both. Next, several case studies from different industries will illustrate the effectiveness of varying vulnerability assessment methodologies. The next several chapters will define the steps of a vulnerability assessment including: defining objectives, identifying and classifying assets, defining rules of engagement, scanning hosts, and identifying operating systems and applications. The next several chapters provide detailed instructions and examples for differentiating vulnerabilities from configuration problems, validating vulnerabilities through penetration testing. The last section of the book provides best practices for vulnerability management and remediation.<br/><br/>* Unique coverage detailing both the management and technical skill and tools required to develop an effective vulnerability management system<br/><br/>* Vulnerability management is rated the #2 most pressing concern for security professionals in a poll conducted by Information Security Magazine<br/><br/>* Covers in the detail the vulnerability management lifecycle from discovery through patch.\n</span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>If you're an advanced security professional, then you know that the battle to protect online privacy continues to rage on.  Security chat rooms, especially, are resounding with calls for vendors to take more responsibility to release products that are more secure.  In fact, with all the information and code that is passed on a daily basis, it's a fight that may never end.  Fortunately, there are a number of open source security tools that give you a leg up in the battle.Often a security tool does exactly what you want, right out of the box.  More frequently,  you need to customize the tool to fit the needs of your network structure.  <i>Network Security Tools</i> shows experienced administrators how to modify, customize, and extend popular open source security tools such as Nikto, Ettercap, and Nessus.This concise, high-end guide discusses the common customizations and extensions for these tools, then shows you how to write even more specialized attack and penetration reviews that are suited to your unique network environment.  It also explains how tools like port scanners, packet injectors, network sniffers, and web assessment tools function.Some of the topics covered include:</p><ul><li>Writing your own network sniffers and packet injection tools</li><li>Writing plugins for Nessus, Ettercap, and Nikto</li><li>Developing exploits for Metasploit</li><li>Code analysis for web applications</li><li>Writing kernel modules for security applications, and understanding rootkits</li></ul>While many books on security are either tediously academic or overly sensational, <i>Network Security Tools</i> takes an even-handed and accessible approach that will let you quickly review the problem and implement new, practical solutions--without reinventing the wheel.  In an age when security is critical, <i>Network Security Tools</i> is the resource you want at your side when locking down your network.</div></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>There are hundreds--if not thousands--of techniques used to compromise both Windows and Unix-based systems. Malicious code and new exploit scripts are released on a daily basis, and each evolution becomes more and more sophisticated. Keeping up with the myriad of systems used by hackers in the wild is a formidable task, and scrambling to patch each potential vulnerability or address each new attack one-by-one is a bit like emptying the Atlantic with paper cup.If you're a network administrator, the pressure is on you to defend your systems from attack. But short of devoting your life to becoming a security expert, what can you do to ensure the safety of your mission critical systems?  Where do you start?Using the steps laid out by professional security analysts and consultants to identify and assess risks, <i>Network Security Assessment</i> offers an efficient testing model that an administrator can adopt, refine, and reuse to create proactive defensive strategies to protect their systems from the threats that are out there, as well as those still being developed.This thorough and insightful guide covers offensive technologies by grouping and analyzing them at a higher level--from both an offensive and defensive standpoint--helping administrators design and deploy networks that are immune to offensive exploits, tools, and scripts. Network administrators who need to develop and implement a security assessment program will find everything they're looking for--a proven, expert-tested methodology on which to base their own comprehensive program--in this time-saving new book.</p></span></span>",

The\nimportance of security policies addressing such issues as Internet\nusage, remote-access usage, and incident reporting is also\ndiscussed, acknowledging that the most comprehensive security\nequipment will not protect an organization if it is poorly\nconfigured, implemented, or used. Quick reference sheets and\nworksheets, included in the appendixes, provide technology reviews\nand allow financial modeling exercises to be performed easily.</p><p>An essential IT\nsecurity-investing tool written from a business management\nperspective, <em>The Business Case for Network Security: Advocacy,\nGovernance, and ROI</em> helps you determine the effective ROP for\nyour business.</p><p>This volume is in the\nNetwork Business Series offered by Cisco Press®.

    "description": "<span><span><span><p>Asia was probably the biggest economic sensation of the post-war decades. The breathtaking success of Japan was followed by a remarkable rise of \"four tigers\", then ASEAN founder states and then China. The Asian miracle became a commonly accepted definition of this success. In the late 1970s and especially 80s it became clear that the balance of power in the world had changed. Politicians, businessmen, scholars began to talk about \"the new Asia Pacific age\" and Asian economic model, different from and, maybe, even superior to Western capitalism. However, in 1997-98 the Asian economic crisis came and made the region a sick man. Six years before that Japan, the regional powerhouse entered more than a decade-long period of stagnation. The miracle was over. However, the crisis was overcome within a surprisingly short period of time. Naturally, the question arises: What now? What is going on in the region after the miracle and after the crisis? What is today's face of Asian capitalism and how should we view its performance?</p><p>Readers interested in regional developments will find a lot of literature about miracle decades and crisis years. However, few analysts have addressed the challenging questions addressed in this book.</p><p>The authors vividly show that Asian capitalism is undergoing a radical structural transformation. These changes are directly affecting its key institutions: governments, companies, labor relations, etc. As a result Asian economic systems are becoming much closer to the Western-style, especially Anglo-Saxon capitalism, though the region retains some important specific features, especially regarding business culture.</p><p>This book is a must for business people worldwide, for all those who study the region in colleges and business schools, for people engaged in various international activities and, finally, for all those who want learn more about our world at the dawn of the new century.</p></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>If you've held back from developing open source or free software projects because you don't understand the implications of the various licenses, you're not alone. Many developers believe in releasing their software freely, but have hesitated to do so because they're concerned about losing control over their software. Licensing issues are complicated, and both the facts and fallacies you hear word-of-mouth can add to the confusion.<i>Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing</i> helps you make sense of the different options available to you. This concise guide focuses on annotated licenses, offering an in-depth explanation of how they compare and interoperate, and how license choices affect project possibilities. Written in clear language that you don't have to be a lawyer to understand, the book answers such questions as: What rights am I giving up? How will my use of OS/FS licensing affect future users or future developers? Does a particular use of this software--such as combining it with proprietary software--leave me vulnerable to lawsuits?Following a quick look at copyright law, contracts, and the definition of \"open source,\" the book tackles the spectrum of licensing, including:</p><ul><li>The MIT (or X), BSD, Apache and Academic Free licenses</li><li>The GPL, LGPL, and Mozilla licenses</li><li>The QT, Artistic, and Creative Commons licenses</li><li>Classic Proprietary licenses</li><li>Sun Community Source license and Microsoft Shared Source project</li></ul>The book wraps up with a look at the legal effects--both positive and negative--of open source/free software licensing.Licensing is a major part of what open source and free software are all about, but it's still one of the most complicated areas of law. Even the very simple licenses are tricky. <i>Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing</i> bridges the gap between the open source vision and the practical implications of its legal underpinnings. If open source and free software licenses interest you, this book will help you understand them. If you're an open source/free software developer, this book is an absolute necessity.</div></span>",

Supplying readers with the statistical means to analyze how numerous variables interact, it is ideal for those seeking breakthroughs in product quality and process efficiency via systematic experimentation.<br/><br/>Following in the footsteps of its bestselling predecessors, this edition incorporates a lively approach to learning the fundamentals of the design of experiments (DOE). It lightens up the inherently dry complexities with interesting sidebars and amusing anecdotes.<br/><br/>The book explains simple methods for collecting and displaying data and presents comparative experiments for testing hypotheses. Discussing how to block the sources of variation from your analysis, it looks at two-level factorial designs and covers analysis of variance. It also details a four-step planning process for designing and executing experiments that takes statistical power into consideration.<br/><br/>This edition includes a major revision of the software that accompanies the book (via download) and sets the stage for introducing experiment designs where the randomization of one or more hard-to-change factors can be restricted. Along these lines, it includes a new chapter on split plots and adds coverage of a number of recent developments in the design and analysis of experiments.<br/><br/>Readers have access to case studies, problems, practice experiments, a glossary of terms, and a glossary of statistical symbols, as well as a series of dynamic online lectures that cover the first several chapters of the book.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>This book is the Windows Server version of the classic <i>TCP/IP Network Administration</i>. Like the book that inspired it, <i>Windows Server 2003 Network Administration</i> provides an overview of the essential TCP/IP protocols, and explains how to properly manage and configure the services based on these protocols. Any skilled network administrator knows that understanding how things work is as important as knowing how things are done. This book is the essential guide to both, containing everything a network administrator needs to exchange information via the Internet, and to build effective reliable networks.</p><p>This must-read guide is divided into three distinct sections: fundamental concepts, tutorial, and reference. The first three chapters are a basic discussion of the network protocols and services. This discussion provides the fundamental concepts necessary to understand the rest of the book. The remaining chapters provide a how-to tutorial for planning, installing and configuring various important network services. The book concludes with three appendixes that are technical references for various configuration options.  Content specifics include how to:</p><p/><ul><li>Install, configure, and manage a Microsoft DNS and Windows DHCP server</li><li>Control remote communications with Microsoft RRAS software</li><li>Protect hosts with Internet Connection Firewalls</li><li>Configure Internet and Intranet Web services with IIS</li><li>Design proper security into your network</li><li>Troubleshoot the network when problems develop</li></ul><p>After you've turned the final page of <i>Windows Server 2003 Network Administration</i>, you'll not only understand how to network, but also <i>why</i> it needs to be done.</p></div></span></span>",

In <i><b>Linux® Hardening in Hostile Networks,</b></i> Kyle Rankin helps you to implement modern safeguards that provide maximum impact with minimum effort and to strip away old techniques that are no longer worth your time.</p><p>Rankin provides clear, concise guidance on modern workstation, server, and network hardening, and explains how to harden specific services, such as web servers, email, DNS, and databases. Along the way, he demystifies technologies once viewed as too complex or mysterious but now essential to mainstream Linux security. He also includes a full chapter on effective incident response that both DevOps and SecOps can use to write their own incident response plan.</p><p>Each chapter begins with techniques any sysadmin can use quickly to protect against entry-level hackers and presents intermediate and advanced techniques to safeguard against sophisticated and knowledgeable attackers, perhaps even state actors. Throughout, you learn what each technique does, how it works, what it does and doesn't protect against, and whether it would be useful in your environment.</p><ul><li><p>Apply core security techniques including 2FA and strong passwords</p></li><li><p>Protect admin workstations via lock screens, disk encryption, BIOS passwords, and other methods</p></li><li><p>Use the security-focused Tails distribution as a quick path to a hardened workstation</p></li><li><p>Compartmentalize workstation tasks into VMs with varying levels of trust</p></li><li><p>Harden servers with SSH, use apparmor and sudo to limit the damage attackers can do, and set up remote syslog servers to track their actions</p></li><li><p>Establish secure VPNs with OpenVPN, and leverage SSH to tunnel traffic when VPNs can't be used</p></li><li><p>Configure a software load balancer to terminate SSL/TLS connections and initiate new ones downstream</p></li><li><p>Set up standalone Tor services and hidden Tor services and relays</p></li><li><p>Secure Apache and Nginx web servers, and take full advantage of HTTPS</p></li><li><p>Perform advanced web server hardening with HTTPS forward secrecy and ModSecurity web application firewalls</p></li><li><p>Strengthen email security with SMTP relay authentication, SMTPS, SPF records, DKIM, and DMARC</p></li><li><p>Harden DNS servers, deter their use in DDoS attacks, and fully implement DNSSEC</p></li><li><p>Systematically protect databases via network access control, TLS traffic encryption, and encrypted data storage</p></li><li><p>Respond to a compromised server, collect evidence, and prevent future attacks</p></li></ul><p><i>Register your product at informit.com/register for convenient access to downloads, updates, and corrections as they become available.</i></p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p/><p>Learn what it takes to build large scale, mission critical applications -hardened applications- on the Azure cloud platform.</p><p>This 208 page book covers the techniques and engineering principles that every architect and developer needs to know to harden their Azure/.NET applications to ensure maximum reliability and high availability when deployed at scale. While the techniques are implemented in .NET and optimized for Azure, the principles here will also be valuable for users of other cloud-based development platforms.</p><p>Applications come in a variety of forms, from simple apps that can be built and deployed in hours to mega-scale apps that need significantly higher engineering rigor and robust organizations to deliver them. How do you build such massively scalable applications to keep pace with traffic demands while always being ‘online’ with five 9's availability?</p><p>The authors take you step by step through the process of evaluating and building applications with the appropriate hardness attributes. For example, it is easy to say that an application should be available \"all the time\", but it is very important to understand what each level of 9 for availability means and the resulting implications on engineering and resources. The book explains the details required for developers and IT Pros to get it right in Azure.</p></span></span>",

This book addresses these new trends in depth, offering the most up-to-date information on the integration of SSH into a security environment. It covers the newest features and applications of SSH-2 (which received Proposed Standard status from the IETF in 2006). SSH2 is more secure than previous versions and has many expanded uses on a wider variety of computing platforms. Another particular note driving new SSH2 adoption are the requirements of recent legislation (PCI/HIPAA/SOX/FISMA). SSH 2 has become an even more valuable tool, as it provides communications security compliance with the latest standards.<br/><br/>This book offers the most up-to-date information on SSH2 in a practical, hands-on, tutorial-style reference that goes well beyond UNIX implementation. It concentrates on the latest version of SSH 2 with all new information.<br/><br/><br/>* Discover why SSH2 offers more robust security than SSH1 and how to incorporate it into your network administration software toolbox.\n</span>",

The course also includes a practice exam, which is based on the NCLEX-RN Test Plan.</p><p><strong>Description</strong><br/>\nThe <em>NCLEX-RN Review Complete Video Course</em> provides more than 11 hours of concise coverage of all the topics a candidate needs to study for the registered nurse licensing exam. It blends the ideal level of discussion, drawings, tables, and case studies into an easily digestible format for study. The NCLEX-RN exam is not a comprehensive recall of clinical nursing facts, but rather a test of critical judgment and management skills. The RN exam has more questions than the PN exam, varying between 75 and 265 questions. It is a more in depth exam in regards to management-level skills than the PN exam. It is a Computer Adaptive Test (CAT) in which each test is assembled interactively based on the candidate's response to previous questions. The authors give students tips for passing the exam from using memory devices to understanding question structure to practice with alternative item style questions.</p><p>This Complete Video Course also includes interactive hands-on exercises available on the course’s streaming site to help you further study for the exam. Section quizzes, glossary quizzes, and a practice final exam are also presented through the course’s interactive site, so you have all the material needed to prepare for the exam.</p><p><strong>About the Instructor</strong><strong>s</strong></p><p><strong>Wilda Rinehart Gardner</strong> received an Associate Degree in Nursing from Northeast Mississippi Community College in Booneville, Mississippi.

In some cases, PN studies are the beginning of the RN studies, but this varies by state and school. It is possible to become a PN, and work as a PN, while continuing to study for the RN exam.</li><li>Nursing students close to their graduation ready to begin their NCLEX exam studies</li></ul><p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p><strong>Lesson 1: Testing Strategies for Success—How to Pass the NCLEX</strong></p><p>As you prepare to take the National Councils Licensure Exam, you might feel overwhelmed and frustrated. There is so much material to review and so many decisions to make. During this lesson, we will discuss the development of the NCLEX, the NCLEX test plan, and the types of questions to expect when taking the exam.<br/>\n We will also discuss testing strategies that really work. These testing strategies help you to eliminate answers that are wrong and focus on the correct answers.</p><p><strong>Lesson 2: Simplifying Pharmacology</strong></p><p>For a number of years I have searched for ways to help students understand and apply knowledge of pharmacology. We all know that a large part of the nurse’s responsibility is the administration of medication and teaching the client and family about their medication. In this lesson, we will discuss simplifying the study of pharmacology by categorizing the medication by family, this will help you to remember the nursing implications and side effects and make answering those difficult pharmacology questions easy.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Lesson 3: Caring for the Client with Respiratory Disorders</strong></p><p>According to the Centers for Disease Control, lung disease is one of the leading causes of death in persons 55 65 years of age living in the United States. It is estimated that more than 35 million Americans live with chronic lung disease. Some of these diseases, such as asbestosis, are the result of occupational exposure and carry associated risks of lung cancer. In this lesson, we will look at the acute life threatening disorders (ARDS and pulmonary embolus) as well as the common noninfectious disorders that contribute to chronic lung disease, infectious diseases of the lower respiratory tract, and emerging pulmonary infections.</p><p>Lesson 4: Caring for the Client with Renal &amp; GU Disorders <br/>\n Disorders of the genitourinary system include diseases and disorders that affect the urinary bladder, ureters, and kidneys as well as disorders of the prostate and testes. In this lesson, we will look at the most common renal and genitourinary disorders, including the treatment of acute and chronic renal failure.</p><p><strong>Lesson 5: Caring for the Client with Hematopoietic Disorders</strong></p><p>The hematopoietic system consists of the blood, blood cells, and blood forming elements. The circulation of blood provides oxygen and nutrients to all body systems and the removal of cellular waste; therefore, a functioning hematological system is essential for life. Hematological disorders can be the result of a lack of function, a reduction in production, or an increase in the destruction of blood cells. In this lesson, we will review the most common hematopoietic disorders. The lessons on “Cancer” and “Caring for the Client with Hematopoietic Disorders” provide additional information on hematopoietic disorders such as leukemia.</p><p><strong>Lesson 6: Obstetrics</strong></p><p>Pregnancy is a special time in a woman’s life. In this discussion of pregnancy, we will include prenatal care, intrapartal care, postpartal care, and the neonatal client. We will also discuss abnormal obstetrics.<br/>\n And no discussion of women’s health would be complete without a discussion of gynecological topics such as STIs and methods of birth control.</p><p><strong>Lesson 7: Caring for the Client with Burns</strong></p><p>Although we seldom think of the skin as an organ, it is the largest and one of the most complex organs of the body. Composed of three layers, the skin performs several vital functions, including protection against infection, prevention of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, regulation of temperature, and activation of vitamin D. In this lesson, we will review the sources of burn injury and focus on the care of the client with major burns.</p><p><strong>Lesson 8: Caring for the Client with Disorders of the Eyes</strong></p><p>Most of us will agree that the abilities to see, hear, taste, perceive touch, and smell are important. Without the ability to smell, food would have little, if any, taste. The sense of touch lets us know when we experience something pleasurable or are injured. But of all the senses, the abilities to see and hear are considered most important, because they keep us most informed about the world around us. Sensory disorders that affect sight and sound can be the result of aging, disease, or injury. In this lesson, we will review common problems affecting the sense of vision and interventions to correct or improve these disorders.</p><p><strong>Lesson 9: Caring for the Client with Disorders of the Ears</strong></p><p>Most of us will agree that the abilities to see, hear, taste, perceive touch, and smell are important. Without the ability to smell, food would have little, if any, taste. The sense of touch lets us know when we experience something pleasurable or are injured. But of all the senses, the abilities to see and hear are considered most important, because they keep us most informed about the world around us. Sensory disorders that affect sight and sound may be the result of aging, disease, or injury. In this lesson, we will review common problems affecting the sense of hearing and interventions to correct or improve these disorders.</p><p><strong>Lesson 10: Cancer</strong></p><p>Cancer ranks as the second leading cause of death in the United States. In this lesson, we will discuss the American Cancer’s Warning Signs, the most common types of cancer, diagnostic studies used to detect cancers, and the treatment of cancers.</p><p><strong>Lesson 11: Caring for the Pediatric Client</strong></p><p>There are few areas in nursing more challenging or more rewarding than working with children and their families. The pediatric nurse combines the knowledge of disease process with an understanding of how illness and injury affect normal growth and development. In this lesson, we will review principles of normal growth and development and some of the most common disorders affecting children, as well as life-threatening conditions including childhood cancer.</p><p><strong>Lesson 12: Caring for the Client with Disorders of the Gastrointestinal System</strong></p><p>Primary functions of the gastrointestinal system are the ingestion and digestion of food (mouth, esophagus, stomach, gallbladder, liver, and pancreas), extraction of nutrients (small intestine), and elimination of waste (large intestine). In addition to these functions, the liver serves as the “chemical treatment facility of the body” and plays a major role in coagulation. Problems in the gastrointestinal system can result in impaired function of the organs involved. In this lesson, we will review the most common gastrointestinal disorders, as well viral infections of the liver and problems associated with food borne illnesses. </p><p><strong>Lesson 13: Fluid &amp; Electrolytes Analysis</strong></p><p>Although fluid and electrolyte balance and acid-base balance are separate entities, they are directly related to one another. During this lesson, we will discuss variations in fluid and electrolytes and acid-base balance and how they can result in disease processes. We will also discuss the treatment of these alterations.</p><p><strong>Lesson 14: Musculoskeletal</strong></p><p>The musculoskeletal system includes muscles, bones, and joints. Injury to the musculoskeletal system is one of the primary reasons for disability in the United States. Advancing age and weakened bones due to osteoporosis are major risk factors for factures. Musculoskeletal trauma can be minor requiring short term care, or major with long term or permanent disabilities. Connective tissue disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, not only affect the joints, but have systemic effects as well. In this lesson, we will discuss injuries and diseases that affect bones, joints, and connective tissue and the treatment of these disorders.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Lesson 15: Caring for the Client with Endocrine Disorders</strong></p><p>The endocrine system is comprised of glands distributed throughout the body. These glands secrete and regulate hormones. When there are alterations in the levels of hormones throughout the body, other organs suffer. In this lesson, we will discuss the function of the glands of the body, diagnostic studies, nutritional requirements, and the disease processes that occur when over or under production of hormones occur.</p><p><strong>Lesson 16: Caring for the Client with Cardiovascular System Disorders</strong></p><p>The cardiovascular system comprises the heart and blood vessels and is responsible for the transport of oxygen and nutrients to the organ systems of the body. In this lesson, we will discuss alterations in the cardiovascular system, diagnostic studies used to determine alterations in normal function, and the treatments used to improve or correct these alterations.</p><p><strong>Lesson 17: Caring for the Client with Neurological System Disorders</strong></p><p>Disorders of the neurological system can be due to several causes, such as direct injuries to the brain and spinal cord, deficiencies of neurotransmitters, or impaired circulation and oxygenation associated with stroke or myocardial infarction. These disorders can be acute and life threatening or chronic with gradual deterioration. In this lesson, we will review common neurological disorders, spinal cord injury, and degenerative neurological disorders.</p><p><strong>Lesson 18: Caring for the Client with Psychiatric Disorders</strong></p><p>In this lesson, we will review the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric-mental health disorders. This lesson covers anxiety-related disorders, personality disorders, the psychotic disorders of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, substance abuse, and some of the disorders seen in childhood and adolescence.</p><p><strong>Lesson 19: Legalities &amp; Wrap-Up</strong></p><p>Safe nursing practice requires knowledge of the practice and legal boundaries of the nurse. The state boards of nursing are responsible for ensuring that those licensed to practice nursing are safe practitioners and that they abide by standards of nursing practice. In this lesson, we will discuss the responsibilities of the licensed practical nurse, the registered nurse, and the unlicensed assistive personal. We will also review material previously discussed on the topic of the NCLEX and testing strategies. Following a review of these topics, we will practice taking questions written in the NCLEX format and finally wrap up our course with a discussion of preparation for the NCLEX with some final words of wisdom.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p><strong>About LiveLessons Video Training</strong><br/>\n LiveLessons Video Training series publishes hundreds of hands-on, expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

    "title": "Nokia Firewall, VPN, and IPSO Configuration Guide",
    "description": "<span>\n\"While Nokia is perhaps most recognized for its leadership in the mobile phone market, they have successfully demonstrated their knowledge of the Internet security appliance market and its customers requirements.\"<br/>--Chris Christiansen, Vice President, Internet Infrastructure and Security Software, IDC.<br/><br/>Syngress has a long history of publishing market-leading books for system administrators and security professionals on commercial security products, particularly Firewall and Virtual Private Network (VPN) appliances from Cisco, Check Point, Juniper, SonicWall, and Nokia (see related titles for sales histories). The Nokia Firewall, VPN, and IPSO Configuration Guide will be the only book on the market covering the all-new Nokia Firewall/VPN Appliance suite. Nokia Firewall/VPN appliances are designed to protect and extend the network perimeter.<br/><br/>According to IDC research, Nokia Firewall/VPN Appliances hold the #3 worldwide market-share position in this space behind Cisco and Juniper/NetScreen. IDC estimated the total Firewall/VPN market at $6 billion in 2007, and Nokia owns 6.6% of this market. Nokia's primary customers for security appliances are Mid-size to Large enterprises who need site-to-site connectivity and Mid-size to Large enterprises who need remote access connectivity through enterprise-deployed mobile devices. Nokia appliances for this market are priced form $1,000 for the simplest devices (Nokia IP60) up to $60,0000 for large enterprise- and service-provider class devices (like the Nokia IP2450 released in Q4 2007). While the feature set of such a broad product range obviously varies greatly, all of the appliances run on the same operating system: Nokia IPSO (IPSO refers to Ipsilon Networks, a company specializing in IP switching acquired by Nokia in 1997. The definition of the acronym has little to no meaning for customers.) As a result of this common operating system across the product line, The Nokia Firewall, VPN, and IPSO Configuration Guide will be an essential reference to users of any of these products. Users manage the Nokia IPSO (which is a Linux variant, specifically designed for these appliances) through a Web interface called Nokia Network Voyager or via a powerful Command Line Interface (CLI). Coverage within the book becomes increasingly complex relative to the product line.<br/><br/>The Nokia Firewall, VPN, and IPSO Configuration Guide and companion Web site will provide seasoned network administrators and security professionals with the in-depth coverage and step-by-step walkthroughs they require to properly secure their network perimeters and ensure safe connectivity for remote users. The book contains special chapters devoted to mastering the complex Nokia IPSO command line, as well as tips and tricks for taking advantage of the new \"ease of use\" features in the Nokia Network Voyager Web interface. In addition, the companion Web site offers downloadable video walkthroughs on various installation and troubleshooting tips from the authors.<br/><br/><br/>* Only book on the market covering Nokia Firewall/VPN appliances, which hold 6.6% of a $6 billion market<br/>* Companion website offers video walkthroughs on various installation and troubleshooting tips from the authors<br/>* Special chapters detail mastering the complex Nokia IPSO command line, as well as tips and tricks for taking advantage of the new \"ease of use\" features in the Nokia Network Voyager Web interface\n</span>",

The first part of the course will explain how an intrusion detection system is used to stop cybersecurity threats such as hackers from infiltrating your network. Next, it will explain why traditional intrusion detection systems are not able to keep up with the rapid evolution of black hat adversaries, and how machine learning offers a self-learning solution that is able to keep up with, and even outsmart them. Further, you will learn the high-level architecture of an ML-based IDS; how to carry out data collection, model selection, and objective selection (such as accuracy or false positive rate); and how all these come together to form a next-generation IDS. Moving forward, you'll see how to implement the ML-based IDS. <div><br/></div><div><b>What You Will Learn</b><br/></div><div><div><ul><li>Discover how an IDS works</li><li>See how machine learning-based IDSs are able to solve the problems that traditional IDSs have faced</li><li>Architect a machine learning-based IDS</li><li>Train the ML components of a next-generation IDS</li><li>Choose the correct metric function for your next-generation IDS in order to satisfy the most commonly encountered business objectives</li></ul><div><b>Who This Video Is For </b></div></div>Cybersecurity professionals, data scientists, and students of these disciplines.<br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></div></div></span>",

Until now, however, most guides to 5G have foregrounded its RF/radio and mobile core innovations, not its implications for data networks. <strong><em>A Network Architect’s Guide to 5G</em></strong> fills the gap,giving network architects, designers, and engineers essential knowledge for designing and planning their own 5G-ready networks.</p><p>Drawing on decades of experience with global service providers and enterprise networks, the authors illuminate new and evolving network technologies necessary for building 5G-capable networks, such as segment routing, network slicing, Timing and Synchronization, distributed data centers for edge computing, integration with public cloud, and more. They explain how 5G blurs boundaries between mobile core, radio access, and transport, as well as the changes in the composition of a traditional cell site with the adoption of Open and Virtualized RAN resulting in a transition to mobile xHaul. Every chapter builds on earlier coverage, culminating in a “big picture” presentation of a complete 5G network design.</p><ul><li><p>Understand the evolution of mobile technologies over the generation leading to 5G’s foundational concepts and principles.</p></li><li><p>Explore 5G changes to Radio Access Networks (RAN), the Mobile Core, Mobile Transport, and the need for tighter integration between them.</p></li><li><p>Use Segment Routing to architect simplified, SDN-capable networks, and enable network slicing for 5G.</p></li><li><p>Rethink transport design to incorporate Far-Edge, Edge, and public-cloud based data centers augmenting centralized DCs to support distributed peering and Multi-access Edge Compute.</p></li><li><p>Provide guidance to meet the criteria and requirements for various aspects of Fronthaul, Midhaul, and Backhaul architecture, such as transport protocol evaluation, latency consideration, routing design, QoS modeling, network device selection, and more.</p></li><li><p>Forge a cohesive 5G network architecture by combining mobile communications principles with advanced transport technologies.</p></li></ul></div></span>",

The latest generation of firewalls offers a dizzying array of powerful options; they key to success is to write concise policies that provide the appropriate level of access while maximizing security. <br/><br/>This book covers the leading firewall products: Cisco PIX, Check Point NGX, Microsoft ISA Server, Juniper’s NetScreen Firewall, and SonicWall. It describes in plain English what features can be controlled by a policy, and walks the reader through the steps for writing the policy to fit the objective. Because of their vulnerability and their complexity, VPN policies are covered in more depth with numerous tips for troubleshooting remote connections.<br/><br/>· The only book that focuses on creating policies that apply to multiple products.<br/>· Included is a bonus chapter on using Ethereal, the most popular protocol analyzer, to monitor and analyze network traffic.<br/>· Shows what features can be controlled by a policy, and walks you through the steps for writing the policy to fit the objective at hand\n</span>",

    "description": "<span><p>The best-selling first edition of <em><b>Firewalls\nand Internet Security</b></em> became the bible of Internet security\nby showing a generation of Internet security experts how to think\nabout threats and solutions. This completely updated and expanded\nsecond edition defines the security problems companies face in\ntoday's Internet, identifies the weaknesses in the most popular\nsecurity technologies, and illustrates the ins and outs of\ndeploying an effective firewall. Readers will learn how to plan and\nexecute a security strategy that allows easy access to Internet\nservices while defeating even the wiliest of hackers.</p><p><b><em>Firewalls and Internet Security, Second\nEdition,</em></b> draws upon the authors' experiences as researchers\nin the forefront of their field since the beginning of the Internet\nexplosion.</p><p>The book begins with an introduction to their\nphilosophy of Internet security. It progresses quickly to a\ndissection of possible attacks on hosts and networks and describes\nthe tools and techniques used to perpetrate--and prevent--such\nattacks. The focus then shifts to firewalls and virtual private\nnetworks (VPNs), providing a step-by-step guide to firewall\ndeployment. Readers are immersed in the real-world practices of\nInternet security through a critical examination of problems and\npractices on today's intranets, as well as discussions of the\ndeployment of a hacking-resistant host and of intrusion detection\nsystems (IDS). The authors scrutinize secure communications over\ninsecure networks and conclude with their predictions about the\nfuture of firewalls and Internet security.</p><p>The book's appendixes provide an introduction to\ncryptography and a list of resources (also posted to the book's Web\nsite) that readers can rely on for tracking further security\ndevelopments.</p><p>Armed with the authors' hard-won knowledge of how\nto fight off hackers, readers of <em><b>Firewalls and Internet\nSecurity, Second Edition,</b></em> can make security decisions that\nwill make the Internet--and their computers--safer.</p><p><br/><br/>\n020163466XB01302003</p></span>",

    "description": "<span>See how privileges, insecure passwords, administrative rights, and remote access can be combined as an attack vector to breach any organization. Cyber attacks continue to increase in volume and sophistication. It is not a matter of <i>if</i>, but <i>when,</i> your organization will be breached. Threat actors target the path of least resistance: users and their privileges.<div><p></p>  In decades past, an entire enterprise might be sufficiently managed through just a handful of credentials. Today’s environmental complexity has seen an explosion of privileged credentials for many different account types such as domain and local administrators, operating systems (Windows, Unix, Linux, macOS, etc.), directory services, databases, applications, cloud instances, networking hardware, Internet of Things (IoT), social media, and so many more. When unmanaged, these privileged credentials pose a significant threat from external hackers and insider threats. We are experiencing an expanding universe of privileged accounts almost everywhere.</div><div><br/></div><div>There is no one solution or strategy to provide the protection you need against all vectors and stages of an attack. And while some new and innovative products will help protect against or detect against a privilege attack, they are not guaranteed to stop 100% of malicious activity. The volume and frequency of privilege-based attacks continues to increase and test the limits of existing security controls and solution implementations.<br/></div><div><p></p><p><b><i>Privileged Attack Vectors</i></b> details the risks associated with poor privilege management, the techniques that threat actors leverage, and the defensive measures that organizations should adopt to protect against an incident, protect against lateral movement, and improve the ability to detect malicious activity due to the inappropriate usage of privileged credentials.<b> </b></p><p>This revised and expanded second edition covers new attack vectors, has updated definitions for privileged access management (PAM), new strategies for defense, tested empirical steps for a successful implementation, and includes new disciplines for least privilege endpoint management and privileged remote access.<b><br/></b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b><br/></p><ul><li>Know how identities, accounts, credentials, passwords, and exploits can be leveraged to escalate privileges during an attack </li><li>Implement defensive and monitoring strategies to mitigate privilege threats and risk </li><li>Understand a 10-step universal privilege management implementation plan to guide you through a successful privilege access management journey</li><li>Develop a comprehensive model for documenting risk, compliance, and reporting based on privilege session activity</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><b><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b><br/></div></b><p></p><p>Security management professionals, new security professionals, and auditors looking to understand and solve privilege access management problems</p></div></span>",

Author Ben McCarty, a cyber warfare specialist and former NSA developer, analyzes once-secret Japanese scrolls, drawing parallels to modern infosec concepts to provide unique insights on defensive and offensive security. He translates the training methodologies of Japan’s most notorious covert agents—history’s first advanced persistent threat (APT)—into highly effective practices for countering information warfare, espionage, supply-chain attacks, zero-day exploits, and more.</p><p>Each chapter examines one TTP in detail—like assessing gaps in a target’s defense, striking where the enemy is negligent, and mastering the art of invisibility—and explains what the concept can teach us about the current cybersecurity landscape. McCarty recommends in-depth mitigations and security controls, mapped to the NIST 800-53 standard, and a “Castle Theory Thought Exercise” that helps you apply the ancient lesson to protect your castle (network) from enemy ninja (cyber threat actors). You’ll discover the effectiveness of ancient social engineering strategies and trap-based security controls; see why mapping your network like an adversary gives you the advantage; and apply lessons from old-world tools, like the “ninja ladder,” to prevent attacks.</p><p>Topics also include:</p><p>•Threat modeling, threat intelligence, and targeted controls<br/>•Countermeasures like network sensors, time-based controls, airgaps, and improved authentication protocols<br/>•Profiles of insider threats, and ways to recognize them in employees<br/>•Covert communication TTPs and their implications for malware command and control (C2)<br/>•Methods for detecting attackers, preventing supply-chain attacks, and defending against zero-day exploits </p><p>In this book, you’ll see the astonishing power of ninja information-gathering processes—and how adopting them just might be the key to innovating contemporary cybersecurity models.</p></div></span>",

However, some networks outperform networks in other enterprises in terms of performance and meeting new business demands, because they were designed with a visionary approach.</p><p>The book starts by describing the various stages in the network lifecycle and covers the plan, build, and operate phases. It covers topics that will help network engineers capture requirements, choose the right technology, design and implement the network, and finally manage and operate the network. It divides the overall network into its constituents depending upon functionality, and describe the technologies used and the design considerations for each functional area. The areas covered include the campus wired network, wireless access network, WAN choices, datacenter technologies, and security technologies. It also discusses the need to identify business-critical applications on the network, and how to prioritize these applications by deploying QoS on the network.</p><p>Each topic provides the technology choices, and the scenario, involved in choosing each technology, and provides configuration guidelines for configuring and implementing solutions in enterprise networks.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>A step-by-step practical guide that ensures you implement Cisco solutions such as enterprise networks, cloud, and data centers, on small-to-large organizations.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book.

This book not only explains the tools and techniques to help readers build their own banks and banking apps, but it also tells a story. Starting with the origins of Bitcoin—what it is and why we need it—find out what its strengths and limitations are. Understand the nature of mining and why so much energy is put into it.  The blockchain itself will be reviewed, as well, and compared to other options such as a normal SQL database or a simple spreadsheet.</p><p>With this book, you can control Bitcoin wallets via RPC commands on a Raspberry Pi. Configure, compile, and run two implementation of the Lightning Network-compatible daemons: LND and c-lightning. And employ user-friendly web apps that abstract the complexities of Bitcoin/Lightning-Network.</p><p>The Internet of Information is currently transitioning to the Internet of Things, which in turn may well  be followed by the Internet of Value (or Money). However, there is no evolution without happy users and Bitcoin will never reach the same heights like the original internet without having offered “useful” and “easy to use” tools. Just like nobody would ever want to use UUCP to send messages via web the same applies to current cryptocurrency tools. These are hard to use and very unforgiving. But, the evolution doesn’t stop here and many easy-to-use tools are already available. We will meet some of them when building apps for the Lightning Network, a new technology running on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain that makes it possible to generate billions of transactions within a single second.  </p><div><b>What You'll Learn</b><br/></div><div><ul><li>Control Bitcoin wallets via console RPC commands<br/></li><li>Run two implementation of the Lightning Network compatible daemons<br/></li><li>Simplify the complexities of Bitcoin and the Lightning network with user-friendly web apps<br/></li></ul></div><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b><br/></div><div>This book is for Makers familiar with the basics of Linux command line processes.</div></span>",

    "description": "<span><p></p><p>Manage complex systems with ease and equip yourself for a new career. This book builds upon the skills you learned in Volumes 1 and 2 of this course and it depends upon the virtual network and virtual machine you created there. </p><p>However, more experienced Linux users can begin with this volume and download an assigned script that will set up the VM for the start of Volume 3. Instructions with the script will provide specifications for configuration of the virtual network and the virtual machine. Refer to the volume overviews in the book's introduction to select the volume of this course most appropriate for your current skill level.</p><p>Start by reviewing the administration of Linux servers and install and configure various Linux server services such as DHCP, DNS, NTP, and SSH server that will be used to provide advanced network services.  You’ll then learn to install and configure servers such as BIND for name services, DHCP for network host configuration, and SSH for secure logins to remote hosts. Other topics covered include public/private keypairs to further enhance security, SendMail and IMAP and antispam protection for email, using Apache and WordPress to create and manage web sites, NFS, SAMBA, and Chrony.<br/></p><p>This volume also covers SELinux, and building RPMs to distribute automation scripts. All of these services are installed on a single server host over the course of the book and by the time you are finished you will have a single server that provides these services for your network.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><p></p><ul><li>Install, configure, and manage several Linux server services such as email with spam management and single and multiple web sites</li><li>Work with NTP time synchronization, DHCP, SSH, and file sharing with Unix/Linux and Windows clients</li><li>Create RPMs for distribution of scripts and administrative programs.</li><li>Understand and work with enhanced security.     </li></ul><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>Those who are already Linux power users – SysAdmins who can administer Linux workstation hosts that are not servers – who want to learn to administer the services provided by Linux servers such as web, time, name, email, SSH, and more. </p><p><br/></p></span>",

We wonder, when will it stop?</p>\n\n<p>While many advances have been made, there is still a need for everyday people to create, innovate, and impact their spheres of influence to advance the common good. Motivated by curiosity, conviction, and a conquering spirit, they can move to fill unoccupied spaces to nurture, persuade, understand, and solve some of society's lingering dilemmas. Those who do the initial significant work in these areas are the ones who bring about such needed change. They are pioneers.</p>\n\n<p>The Pioneer's Way establishes a working definition of the pioneer, explores pioneering versus leadership, and offers essential characteristics of the pioneer. These are illustrated by colorful examples of pioneers both past and present-motivating listeners with inspirational, frontiering stories, while equipping them with the journey's essentials for moving forward to make needed, significant change. Listeners will journey down a systematic path that will help them navigate unfamiliar territory so they too can respond to the pioneer's call and answer it through effective, beneficial action in both their lives and the lives they touch.</p></span>",

The danger they present may not be readily apparent because of their ability to charm, deceive, and manipulate. Although not necessarily criminal, their self-serving nature frequently is destructive to the organizations that employ them. So how can we protect ourselves and our organizations in a business climate that offers the perfect conditions for psychopaths to thrive?</p>\n\n<p>In Snakes in Suits, Hare, an expert on the scientific study of psychopathy, and Babiak, an industrial and organizational psychologist and a leading authority on the corporate psychopath, examine the role of psychopaths in modern corporations and provide the tools employers can use to avoid and deal with them. Together, they have developed the B-Scan 360, a research tool designed specifically for business professionals.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Babiak and Dr. Hare reveal the secret lives of psychopaths, explain the ways in which they manipulate and deceive, and help you to see through their games. The rapid pace of today's corporate environment provides the perfect breeding ground for these \"snakes in suits\" and this newly revised and updated classic gives you the insight, information, and power to protect yourself and your company before it's too late.</p></span>",

Why? There are many reasons including: A lot of network operating systems are based on Linux, or have a Linux shell you can access, or use Linux type commands. The author shows you an example using Cisco, Arista, and Cumulus Linux. Network Automation tools such as Ansible don't run the command node on Windows. You are probably going to use Linux with tools such as Ansible, Netmkio, NAPALM and other network automation tools. SDN controllers such as OpenDaylight, ONOS, RYU and APIC-EM run on Linux. You will find that many SDN tools require Linux. DevOps tools such as git work best with Linux. IoT devices typically run Linux. A new breed of network devices from companies like Facebook, Microsoft and Cumulus Linux use Linux.</p><p>There are even more reasons, but make sure you don't get left behind! You as a network engineer start learning Linux. Learn how to configure Linux networking, how to create users and assign permissions, how to install and run Linux services such as DNS and DHCP.</p><p>The course uses various GNS3 topologies with devices such as:</p><ul><li>Linux Docker containers</li><li>Linux GNS3 QEMU virtual machines</li><li>Traditional Linux virtual machines</li><li>Network devices - you could use Cisco, Arista, Cumulus Linux or others</li></ul><p>Do you want to see something else added to the course? Just let me know. I like to get your feedback on ways I can improve the course and add more content that you think is relevant.</p><p>Networking is changing. Make sure you keep up to date! All the very best!</p></span>",

    "description": "<span>\n    \n      The adoption of smartphones has had as a corollary the use of services that require streaming, such as video streaming, which is a constraint for the 4G mobile network. The integration of the network of Wi-Fi hotspots deployed by the operators adds capacity to the 4G mobile network.<br/>The use of Wi-Fi technology in carrier networks is the result of developments coordinated by the IEEE, WFA and WBA standardization bodies. For its part, the 3GPP standardization body has been working to integrate Wi-Fi technology into the 4G mobile network.<br/>The first part of this book presents the characteristics of the Wi-Fi radio interface. The different IEEE 802.11b / g / n / ac physical layers characterize the implementation in the 2.4 GHz ISM frequency bands and U- NII at 5 GHz. The MAC layer defines a number of media access procedures such as scanning, associating, or transferring data.<br/>The second part of this book deals with the architecture of the 4G network based on the Wi-Fi interface. This architecture defines several models corresponding, on the one hand, to Wi-Fi access controlled or not, On the other hand, to a handover controlled by the network or by the mobile. The integration of Wi-Fi technology resulted in a redefinition of attachment and session set-up procedures.<br/>Smartphones have the ability to activate simultaneously the two radio interfaces, LTE and Wi-Fi, which allows to direct certain services to one and / or the other of the interfaces. The ANDSF and HotSpot 2.0 functions provide the mobile with rules for network selection and traffic control to determine which traffic is to be routed to what type of interface.\n   \n  </span>",

In See Sooner, Act Faster, strategy experts George Day and Paul Schoemaker offer tools for thriving when digital advances intensify turbulence.</p>\n\n<p>Vigilant firms have greater foresight than their rivals, while vulnerable firms often miss early signals of external threats and organizational challenges. Charles Schwab, for example, was early to see and act on the promise of \"robo-advisors\"; Honeywell, on the other hand, stumbled when Nest Labs came out first with a \"smart\" thermostat. Day and Schoemaker show leaders how to assess their vigilance capabilities and cultivate insight and foresight throughout their organizations. They draw on a range of cases, including Adobe and Intuit's move to the cloud, Shell's investment in clean energy, and MasterCard's early recognition of digital challenges.</p>\n\n<p>Day and Schoemaker describe how to allocate the scarce resource of attention, how to detect weak signals and separate them from background noise, and how to respond strategically before competitors do. The challenge is not just to act faster but to act wisely, and the authors suggest ways to create dynamic portfolios of options. </p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>The instant access that hackers have to the latest tools and techniques demands that companies become more aggressive in defending the security of their networks. Conducting a network vulnerability assessment, a self-induced hack attack, identifies the network components and faults in policies, and procedures that expose a company to the damage caused by malicious network intruders. Managing a Network Vulnerability Assessment provides a formal framework for finding and eliminating network security threats, ensuring that no vulnerabilities are overlooked. This thorough overview focuses on the steps necessary to successfully manage an assessment, including the development of a scope statement, the understanding and proper use of assessment methodology, the creation of an expert assessment team, and the production of a valuable response report. The book also details what commercial, freeware, and shareware tools are available, how they work, and how to use them. By following the procedures outlined in this guide, a company can pinpoint what individual parts of their network need to be hardened, and avoid expensive and unnecessary purchases.</p></span>",
