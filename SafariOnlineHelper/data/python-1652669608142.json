    "description": "<span><span><p/><p><strong>6+ Hours of Video Instruction</strong><br/><br/><strong>Python Programming Language LiveLessons</strong> provides developers with a guided tour of the Python programming language, including an introduction to many of the advanced techniques used in libraries and frameworks.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Description</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/> In this video training, David Beazley covers the essential features of Python programming through a series of practical programming examples. David assumes you are a programmer, familiar with central programming concepts such as control flow, functions, and data structures. The course provides programmers with an accelerated introduction to the essential parts of Python. Those with some previous Python experience will benefit from being exposed to modern Python style and programming idioms used by experienced programmers. Each lesson covers a “big idea” rather than taking an exhaustive, reference-style approach. In each lesson David addresses a specific, practical problem and demonstrates the solution through code. He explains the steps taken and why he is taking a particular approach.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>About the Instructor</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>David Beazley</strong> is an independent software developer, teacher, and book author living in the city of Chicago. He primarily works on programming tools and teaches programming courses for software developers, scientists, and engineers. He is the author of the <em>Python Essential Reference</em> (Addison-Wesley) and <em>Python Cookbook, 3rd Ed. </em>(O'Reilly Media). He has also created several open-source packages including Swig, PLY, and Curio. He is a frequent speaker at PyCon. Although Python is his current language of choice, he also has significant experience with systems programming in C, C++, and assembly language.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Skill Level</strong><br/><br/></p><ul><li>Intermediate</li><li>Advanced</li></ul><strong>What You Will Learn</strong><br/><ul><li>Python program structure and execution model</li><li>How to read and write data from files</li><li>How to effectively manipulate data using tuples, lists, sets, and dictionaries</li><li>How to define new functions</li><li>How to handle exceptions and errors</li><li>How to create new objects with classes</li><li>Essential object-oriented programming techniques</li><li>Customization of objects with special methods, properties, and descriptors</li><li>Metaprogramming features including decorators, class decorators, and metaclasses</li><li>Iterative data processing with generator functions</li><li>Placing code into modules and packages</li><li>How to use higher-order functions and closures</li><li>An introduction to coroutines and asynchronous I/O handling</li></ul><strong>Who Should Take This Course</strong><br/><ul><li>Experienced programmers looking for a practical introduction to Python and current Python programmers interested in learning new techniques and ways of thinking about problems.</li></ul><strong>Course Requirements</strong><br/><ul><li>Basic understanding of programming concepts, algorithms, and development tools</li></ul><strong>Lesson 1: Working Environment</strong><br/><br/>Lesson 1 introduces the basics of working in the Python programming environment. This includes starting and stopping the interpreter, using the interactive console, editing and running programs, and turning simple programs into useful scripts. Getting help and some basic debugging tips are also described.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Lesson 2: Program Structure and Execution Model</strong><br/><br/>Lesson 2 covers Python’s execution model and describes the statements related to variables, expressions, and simple control flow. It also covers using Python to perform simple mathematical calculations, making formatted output, and writing to a file.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Lesson 3: Text Processing and Files</strong><br/><br/>To do almost anything useful, you need to be able to read data into your program. Lesson 3 addresses the problem of reading data from a file, basic techniques for manipulating text strings, converting input data, and performing calculations. It also introduces the csv module for reading data from CSV files.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Lesson 4: Functions and Error Handling<br/><br/></strong>As you write larger programs, you will want to get organized. The primary way of doing this in Python is to write functions. And if you write functions, you will want them to play nicely with others. Lesson 4 addresses the problem of writing function definitions, handling exceptions, and coding practices that will help you when you start to write larger programs.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Lesson 5: Data Structures and Data Manipulation</strong><br/><br/>One of the most critical Python skills to develop is being able to effectively use lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. Lesson 5 includes how to read a file into a useful data structure. It then explores different ways of performing calculations on the data, including data reductions, filtering, joining, and sorting. Particular attention is given to list, set, and dict comprehensions a feature that greatly simplifies a wide variety of data processing tasks.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Lesson 6: Library Functions and Import</strong><br/><br/>As you write larger Python programs, you will want to write library functions and split your code across multiple files. To do this, you need to start working with modules and packages. Lesson 6 delves into creating and using modules. It starts with how to use the import statement and some of its gotchas. Next it covers how to create a general purpose CSV parsing function and apply it to some of our earlier code. The lesson concludes with a discussion of organizing larger code bases into packages.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Lesson 7: Classes and Objects<br/><br/></strong>Object-oriented programming is a fundamental part of the Python language. You see this whenever you use its built-in types and execute methods on the resulting instances. If you want to make your own objects, you can do so using the class statement. A class is often a convenient way to define a data structure and to attach methods that carry out operations on the data. Lesson 7 covers the basics of defining a new object, creating instances, and manipulating objects. It then helps you see how the dynamic nature of Python enables you to write highly generic functions. The Lesson concludes with a special topic on how to write classes that need to have more than one initializer method.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Lesson 8: Inheritance</strong><br/><br/>One of the most challenging problems in writing larger programs is that of code reuse and extensibility. A common tool used to address this problem is inheritance. Lesson 8 addresses using inheritance to make a program extensible as well as some of the tricky practical concerns that might arise as a result. Some advanced inheritance concepts, such as multiple inheritance with mixin classes and abstract base classes, are also introduced. The lesson concludes by discussing a few important design considerations to take into account if you’re going to use inheritance.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Lesson 9: Python Magic Methods (a.k.a., Speaking Python)</strong><br/><br/>When defining new objects, it is usually beneficial to make your objects play nicely with other parts of Python. This is typically done by adding special or \"magic\" methods to your class. Lesson 9 demonstrates some of the common customizations that are made to objects to simplify debugging, create containers, and manage resources. Although this section doesn’t cover every possible customization that can be carried out, it gives you a taste of what’s possible and a foundation for more exploration.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Lesson 10: Encapsulation (Owning the Dot)</strong><br/><br/>Major issues that arise in larger programs are how to encapsulate internal implementation details and how to have more control over the ways in which developers interact with objects. Lesson 10 dives into some of the low-level details that make the Python object system tick. It then turns to techniques for taking control over attribute access and custom-tailoring the environment to address issues such as data validation, type checking, and more. Topics include defining private attributes, properties, descriptors, and redefining magic methods for attribute access.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Lesson 11: Higher Order Functions and Closures</strong><br/><br/>Functions are the basic organizational unit of all Python programs regardless of whether or not they serve as a stand-alone function or the method of a class. Lesson 11 introduces some important functional programming concepts, including the idea of functions as first class objects, passing functions as data, and creating functions as results. Particular emphasis is placed on closures as a tool for generating and simplifying code.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Lesson 12: Metaprogramming and Decorators</strong><br/><br/>One of the most difficult problems in developing larger programs is dealing with highly repetitive code. For example, as a general rule you want to avoid situations where you’re cutting and pasting common code fragments between functions or across files. Restructuring the design of your program might help solve such problems. However, another common technique is to encapsulate common code-oriented tasks into a decorator. Lesson 12 covers how to write decorators for processing both function and class definitions.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Lesson 13: Metaclasses</strong><br/><br/>One of the problems faced by the creators of large applications and frameworks is exercising control over the greater programming environment. Code is often organized using classes, but sometimes there is much more to it than simply making class definitions. For example, classes might need to register their existence with some other part of a framework. Or perhaps the definition of a class is too verbose and needs to be simplified in some way. Or perhaps some other aspect of classes needs to be managed. An advanced technique for addressing these problems is to use a metaclass. Lesson 13 introduces the metaclass concept and some practical applications are shown.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Lesson 14: Iterators and Generators</strong><br/><br/>One of Python’s most useful features is the for-statement, which is used to iterate over data. As you may have noticed, the for-statement works with a wide variety of objects such as lists, dicts, sets, and files. It’s also used in a variety of related features, such as list comprehensions. One of the most powerful features of iteration is that it can be easily customized. Lesson 14 starts with the iteration protocol and how to customize it using generator functions. It also covers how to apply iteration to data processing pipelines a particularly powerful technique for working with data and problems involving workflows.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Lesson 15: Coroutines</strong><br/><br/>Starting in Python 3.5, a special kind of function known as a \"coroutine\" could be defined using special async/await syntax. On the surface, coroutines look a lot like normal Python functions. However, under the covers they run under the supervision of a manager that coordinates their execution. Lesson 15 introduces coroutines and shows how they can be used to implement a simple network service that can handle thousands of concurrent client connections. It concludes by peeling back some of the covers to see how coroutines actually work and to explore their relationship to generators.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>About LiveLessons Video Training<br/><br/></strong><br/><br/>The LiveLessons Video Training series publishes hundreds of hands-on, expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

    "description": "<span><div><p>As Python continues to grow in popularity, projects are becoming larger and more complex. Many Python developers are taking an interest in high-level software design patterns such as hexagonal/clean architecture, event-driven architecture, and the strategic patterns prescribed by domain-driven design (DDD). But translating those patterns into Python isn’t always straightforward.<br/><br/>With this hands-on guide, Harry Percival and Bob Gregory from MADE.com introduce proven architectural design patterns to help Python developers manage application complexity—and get the most value out of their test suites. <br/><br/>Each pattern is illustrated with concrete examples in beautiful, idiomatic Python, avoiding some of the verbosity of Java and C# syntax. Patterns include:</p><ul><li>Dependency inversion and its links to ports and adapters (hexagonal/clean architecture)</li><li>Domain-driven design’s distinction between Entities, Value Objects, and Aggregates </li><li>Repository and Unit of Work patterns for persistent storage</li><li>Events, commands, and the message bus</li><li>Command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS)</li><li>Event-driven architecture and reactive microservices</li></ul></div></span>",

The pytest testing framework helps you write tests quickly and keep them readable and maintainable - with no boilerplate code. Using a robust yet simple fixture model, it's just as easy to write small tests with pytest as it is to scale up to complex functional testing for applications, packages, and libraries. This book shows you how.</p><p>For Python-based projects, pytest is the undeniable choice to test your code if you're looking for a full-featured, API-independent, flexible, and extensible testing framework. With a full-bodied fixture model that is unmatched in any other tool, the pytest framework gives you powerful features such as assert rewriting and plug-in capability - with no boilerplate code.</p><p>With simple step-by-step instructions and sample code, this book gets you up to speed quickly on this easy-to-learn and robust tool. Write short, maintainable tests that elegantly express what you're testing. Add powerful testing features and still speed up test times by distributing tests across multiple processors and running tests in parallel. Use the built-in assert statements to reduce false test failures by separating setup and test failures. Test error conditions and corner cases with expected exception testing, and use one test to run many test cases with parameterized testing. Extend pytest with plugins, connect it to continuous integration systems, and use it in tandem with tox, mock, coverage, unittest, and doctest.</p><p>Write simple, maintainable tests that elegantly express what you're testing and why.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>The examples in this book are written using Python 3.6 and pytest 3.0.

    "description": "<span><div><p>If you’re among the Python developers put off by asyncio’s complexity, it’s time to take another look. Asyncio is complicated because it aims to solve problems in concurrent network programming for both framework and end-user developers. The features you need to consider are a small subset of the whole asyncio API, but picking out the right features is the tricky part. That’s where this practical book comes in.</p><p>Veteran Python developer Caleb Hattingh helps you gain a basic understanding of asyncio’s building blocks—enough to get started writing simple event-based programs. You’ll learn why asyncio offers a safer alternative to preemptive multitasking (threading) and how this API provides a simpleway to support thousands of simultaneous socket connections.</p><ul><li>Get a critical comparison of asyncio and threading for concurrent network programming</li><li>Take an asyncio walk-through, including a quickstart guidefor hitting the ground looping with event-based programming</li><li>Learn the difference between asyncio features for end-user developers and those for framework developers</li><li>Understand asyncio’s new async/await language syntax, including coroutines and task and future APIs</li><li>Get detailed case studies (with code) of some popular asyncio-compatible third-party libraries</li></ul></div></span>",

Most software is a solution to a problem, and so you need to understand the problem before you can go about solving the problem. The goal of this lesson is to make sure you understand the problems that web applications solve as well as the problems that web frameworks such as Django help solve. This will help you understand the rest of the lessons and why Django works the way it does.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 2: Prepare the Project and Manipulate Data</strong><br/>\n Lesson 2 addresses organizing data and getting data structured. Like building a house, where you begin with a foundation, Django and Python are the foundation for your project. Continuing the analogy, houses may or may not have basements. That should be planned up front, not decided later after the house is well under way. Structuring data models is similar. Not every web application needs data models, but if you are building a web application that needs them, you want to start developing that model from the start. You learn how to structure data in Django so that it generates your database automatically, setting yourself up for success when building out the rest of the application. Also, you learn how to use Docker to run a development server for your application.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 3: Display Data via an API</strong><br/>\n In Lesson 3, you can now allow users to view the data in the database. You learn how to build API endpoints using Django Rest Framework APIViews, Serializers, and ModelSerializers, to display your data in JSON or other serialized formats, such as XML or YAML. You further learn to use Django Rest Framework’s generic views, such as the RetrieveAPIView and ListAPIView, to shorten your code.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 4: Display Data in HTML Pages</strong><br/>\n In Lesson 4, you learn how to use Django to return HTML to display the data. Learn to use Django’s core triumvirate to generate and return HTML: Django views, URL paths, and the Django Template language. Build your application using both function views and class-based views. Learn to use Django shortcuts to make your life easier, and leverage Django generic class-based views to radically limit the amount of code you write.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 5: Receive and Manipulate Data via an API</strong><br/>\n In Lesson 5, you build API endpoints that enable users to modify data on the server by handling the HTTP POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE methods by modifying Django Rest Framework APIViews to leverage ModelSerializers. Learn to avoid work and build more quickly by using generic API views such as the CreateAPIView, DestroyAPIView, and even the RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 6: Receive and Manipulate Data via HTML Forms</strong><br/>\n Lesson 6 uses Django Forms and ModelForms to render HTML forms in the Django Template Language and then enable the processing and validation of data submitted by users through the forms.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 7: Deploy!</strong><br/>\n Lesson 7 covers how to deploy your application to the cloud. The lesson discusses the different types of clouds and what works best with different types of applications and different kinds of organizations. It covers modifications to Django for deployments generally and for deployment to Heroku specifically. You also actually deploy the application. Finally, the lesson covers how you might have done things differently in a real application setting, using other tools and working top down rather than bottom up, the approach taken for purposes of the course.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>About Pearson Video Training</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n Pearson publishes expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

It is designed to support Python application development on Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p><p>As Python 2 is no longer maintained by the Python development team, and there are no more security updates, the focus has now shifted to using Python 3.</p><p>This course will guide you through concepts such as variables, data structures, conditionals, object-oriented programming (OOP), and the Python third-party package ecosystem. You will also get to grips with unit testing your code. As you progress, you'll get hands-on experience by working through several mini-projects such as creating an exciting guessing game. Finally, you'll learn how to develop an image recognition application that can detect objects in photographs, such as people, cars, bikes, and more.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will be well-versed with Python 3 and be able to apply your skills in the real world.</p><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p>This course is for those who are new to programming or have programming knowledge of another language. Intermediate-level Python programmers who are looking to enhance their Python programming knowledge will also find this course useful.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><strong>7+ Hours of Video Instruction</strong><p><strong>Overview</strong></p><p>Python is a great, beginner-friendly programming language because it was originally designed with learners in mind. It is also used by professional developers in a wide range of applications, like web programming, data science, artificial intelligence, and DevOps. It is estimated that there are about 3 million Python programmers in the world, and by some accounts, it is the fastest growing, most widely used language, especially in high-GDP countries. Out of dozens of programming languages, Python is the third most loved language and is the number one language that current and aspiring developers want to learn.</p><p>As an instructor who regularly teaches people who are completely new to programming, Arianne has found that students are often looking for more context than is provided in most introductory courses. Specifically, students want to know how various languages fit into the programming landscape, as well as what next steps they should take after the course. <em><strong>Introduction to Python LiveLessons</strong></em> attempts to fill these gaps by providing “extra context” lessons, in addition to teaching fundamental programming concepts, answering questions like, “Why are there so many languages?”, “How is Python different from other languages?”, and “What concepts should I learn next?” Afterwards, the lessons end with a crash-course on data analysis and web development, the two primary uses of Python.</p><p><strong>Table of Contents</strong><br/>\n Introduction<br/>\n Lesson 1: Introduction to Programming and Python<br/>\n Lesson 2: Python and Programming Basics<br/>\n Lesson 3: Control Flow with Conditionals<br/>\n Lesson 4: Lists and Loops<br/>\n Lesson 5: Advanced Language Topics<br/>\n Lesson 6: Introduction to Data Analysis in Python<br/>\n Lesson 7: Introduction to Web Development in Python<br/>\n Summary<br/>\n</p><p><strong>Description</strong></p><p>This 7+ hour LiveLesson video helps absolute beginners get started in Python, which is one of the most popular and in-demand languages in use today. Python was created with beginners in mind, but don't let its simple nature fool you. It is used by professional developers in a wide range of applications, such as web programming, data analysis, machine learning, and DevOps. While most introductory courses focus on the basics of the language, this course goes one step further to explain how Python is used in practice in the fields of data analysis and web development.</p><p>Students learn fundamental programming concepts‚Äìfor example, variables and functions. They are given hands-on, modular problems to solve so they can progress as they go. Finally, students tie it all together and experiment with some real programming in the form of text-based games.</p><p>The overall goal of this course is to help absolute beginners learn from scratch, navigate the esoteric world of software development, and then kick-start their programming journey with introductions to two of the more common uses of Python: data analysis and web development.</p><p>The companion files for this LiveLesson can be accessed from <a href=\"https://github.com/ariannedee/intro-to-python-livelessons\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/ariannedee/intro-to-python-livelessons</a>.</p><strong>About the Instructor</strong><p><strong>Arianne Dee</strong> is a full-stack software developer, technology educator, and all-around maker, located in Vancouver, Canada. She has four years of professional Python experience and loves Python for its intuitive syntax and broad applications. Over the years she has been an instructor for introductory programming courses through Canada Learning Code, presented at Python conferences, and coauthored the open-source project django-graph-api. Arianne is the instructor of <em>Rethinking REST LiveLessons</em> (Addison-Wesley, 2019) and has worked on various Live Trainings on these topics.</p><p><strong>Skill Level</strong></p><ul><li>Beginner</li></ul><p><strong>What You Will Learn</strong></p><p>Students will learn how to</p><ul><li>Think like a programmer</li><li>Solve mini practice problems in Python</li><li>Use common libraries like “math” and “random”</li><li>Build three small games to practice their learning</li><li>Use PyCharm, a code editor for Python</li><li>Clean up code so it is easy to understand</li></ul><p>Once the basics are down, Arianne will provide</p><ul><li>A brief introduction to data analysis</li><li>A brief introduction to web development</li><li>An overview of classes, external libraries, and virtual environments in Python</li></ul><p><strong>Who Should Take This Course</strong></p><ul><li><em>Primary: </em>People who are curious about programming and have little to no experience in it</li><li><em>Secondary:</em> Beginner/novice programmers who already know one language and want to learn Python</li></ul><p><strong>Course Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>General computer skills are an asset‚Äìfor example, moving, copying, renaming, and deleting files on the computer they will be using</li><li>Experience using text-editors and/or spreadsheet applications</li><li>Comfort using web browsers and search engines</li></ul><p><strong>About Pearson Video Training</strong></p><p>Pearson publishes expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

    "description": "<span><p><b>Uncover modern Python with this guide to Python data structures, design patterns, and effective object-oriented techniques</b></p><h4>Key Features</h4><ul><li>In-depth analysis of many common object-oriented design patterns that are more suitable to Python's unique style</li><li>Learn the latest Python syntax and libraries</li><li>Explore abstract design patterns and implement them in Python 3.8</li></ul><h4>Book Description</h4><p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a popular design paradigm in which data and behaviors are encapsulated in such a way that they can be manipulated together. This third edition of Python 3 Object-Oriented Programming fully explains classes, data encapsulation, and exceptions with an emphasis on when you can use each principle to develop well-designed software.</p><p>Starting with a detailed analysis of object-oriented programming, you will use the Python programming language to clearly grasp key concepts from the object-oriented paradigm. You will learn how to create maintainable applications by studying higher level design patterns. The book will show you the complexities of string and file manipulation, and how Python distinguishes between binary and textual data. Not one, but two very powerful automated testing systems, unittest and pytest, will be introduced in this book. You'll get a comprehensive introduction to Python's concurrent programming ecosystem.</p><p>By the end of the book, you will have thoroughly learned object-oriented principles using Python syntax and be able to create robust and reliable programs confidently.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Implement objects in Python by creating classes and defining methods</li><li>Grasp common concurrency techniques and pitfalls in Python 3</li><li>Extend class functionality using inheritance</li><li>Understand when to use object-oriented features, and more importantly when not to use them</li><li>Discover what design patterns are and why they are different in Python</li><li>Uncover the simplicity of unit testing and why it's so important in Python</li><li>Explore concurrent object-oriented programming</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>If you're new to object-oriented programming techniques, or if you have basic Python skills and wish to learn in depth how and when to correctly apply OOP in Python, this is the book for you. If you are an object-oriented programmer for other languages or seeking a leg up in the new world of Python 3.8, you too will find this book a useful introduction to Python. Previous experience with Python 3 is not necessary.</p></span>",

This video tutorial will also teach you about the Cython language, such as adding types to code, exceptions and docstrings, and loops and memoryviews. You will also cover extension types, wrapping C and C++ libraries, Cython compiler directives, and concurrency. Finally, Caleb will leave you with some tips and tricks.<br/><br/>Once you have completed this computer based training course, you will have learned how to create your own simple extension modules in Cython, analyze the performance of Cython code, and how to package your own Cython extension module so that it can be shared with others.</p></span></span>",

Python is a big language, and it's not our intention with this book to cover everything there is to know. We just want to make sure that you, as the developer, know the tools, basic idioms and of course the ins and outs of the language, the standard library and other modules to be able to jump into most projects.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>We introduce topics gently and then revisit them on multiple occasions to add the depth required to support your progression as a Python developer.

    "title": "Asynchronous Programming with Python: Write, Test, and Debug Robust Asynchronous Code",
    "description": "<span><div>In this course, we will look at using asynchronous programming in Python: the options, pitfalls, and best practices. We start with multi-threading, which is particularly useful when there is a lot of waiting, e.g. for HTTP requests or disk access. With multi-threading, you can start many requests in quick succession and then wait for all of them to complete at once. Next, the course will show you how to write your code in a thread-safe manner, and how to use it risk-free. Further, it covers Python’s global interpreter lock, which prevents a lot of serious problems in Python but also stops you from running threads in parallel. <div>Going forward we discover how you can use Python’s multiprocessing library to run functions in parallel. Threads and processes often need to share or exchange data. In asynchronous code just passing Python objects is usually not the safest way to do this. This course looks at the main ways to do this correctly in Python, such as queues and events. Finally, the course moves on to the concurrent.future library which contains higher-level abstractions, including thread and processing pools and an asynchronous map function.<div><br/></div><div>The course finishes with advice on how to write robust asynchronous code, and how to test and debug it.</div><div><br/></div><div><b>What You Will Learn</b></div><div><ul><li><div>Take advantage of multi threading (concurrency) using the threading module</div></li><li><div>Implement multi processing (parallelism) using the multiprocessing module</div></li><li><div>Understand inter-process communication and data sharing using locks, queues, semaphores, barriers, events, and timers</div></li><li><div>Test and debug asynchronous Python code</div></li><li><div>Understand thread and process pools using concurrent.futures</div></li></ul><div><b>Who This Video Is For</b></div><div>Intermediate to experienced Python programmers who want to speed up existing Python code by using multi processing and multi threading.</div></div></div></div></span>",

It runs on all major platforms in a huge array of use cases. Coding in Python minimizes development time and increases productivity in comparison to other languages. Clean, maintainable code is easy to both read and write using Python's clear, concise syntax.</p><p>Object-oriented programming is a popular design paradigm in which data and behaviors are encapsulated in such a way that they can be manipulated together. Many modern programming languages utilize the powerful concepts behind object-oriented programming and Python is no exception. </p><p>Starting with a detailed analysis of object-oriented analysis and design, you will use the Python programming language to clearly grasp key concepts from the object-oriented paradigm. This book fully explains classes, data encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and exceptions with an emphasis on when you can use each principle to develop well-designed software.</p><p>You'll get an in-depth analysis of many common object-oriented design patterns that are more suitable to Python's unique style. This book will not just teach Python syntax, but will also build your confidence in how to program.</p><p>You will also learn how to create maintainable applications by studying higher level design patterns. Following this, you'll learn the complexities of string and file manipulation, and how Python distinguishes between binary and textual data. Not one, but two very powerful automated testing systems will be introduced in the book. After you discover the joy of unit testing and just how easy it can be, you'll study higher level libraries such as database connectors and GUI toolkits and learn how they uniquely apply object-oriented principles. You'll learn how these principles will allow you to make greater use of key members of the Python eco-system such as Django and Kivy.</p><p>This new edition includes all the topics that made Python 3 Object-oriented Programming an instant Packt classic. It's also packed with updated content to reflect recent changes in the core Python library and covers modern third-party packages that were not available on the Python 3 platform when the book was first published.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>Throughout the book you will learn key object-oriented programming techniques demonstrated by comprehensive case studies in the context of a larger project.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book.

It also demonstrates the final product--a Pie Factory that you\ninteract with through a web browser. The backend demonstrates how to hold the\nlogic and data that powers the factory.<br/><br/><b>Lesson 2: The\nRecipe–Python Handling Text</b><br/>This lesson focuses on how to read\ninput from an external source. In this case, it's a copy of my\nGrandmother's Apple pie recipe saved to disk. We break the text up into\nparts. We introduce the concept of functions. Finally, we refactor all the\nbreaking up of the recipe code into functions to introduce\nreusability.<br/><br/><b>Lesson 3: Ingredients–Python Base Types (string,\nint, decimal, tuple, lists)</b><br/>This lesson focuses on converting the text\nin the recipe into some representative data types so we can work with them. For\nexample, our program needs to know what the string \"1/2 cup of flour\" really\nmeans.<br/><br/><b>Lesson 4: Mixing Ingredients–Python Dictionaries</b><br/>In Lesson 2, we read the ingredients/steps. In Lesson 3, we parsed those\ningredients to gain some understanding of what they do. Now we take the steps\nand mix the ingredients so that you come to a deeper understanding of advanced\ndata structures, like dictionaries.<br/><br/><b>Lesson 5 Bake It–Python:\nFunctions</b><br/>This lesson goes deeper into functions in Python. You learn\nabout the syntax, how to write, how to execute, and how to document. You learn\na little bit about how to run many functions at the same time. Finally, you\nlearn about parameters and arguments and how they can be customized in order to\nform more functionality to accomplish real tasks while re-using\ncode.<br/><br/><b>Lesson 6: Many Types of Pie–Python Classes</b><br/>In this\nlesson, we start creating our own Pie Class. The running metaphor melds nicely\nwith the idea of repeatability without giving up flexibility. We experience the\nbeauty of Python as we start to dive deeper into the concepts of object-\noriented programming.<br/><br/><b>Lesson 7: Pie Factory–Object-Oriented\nPython</b><br/>In this lesson, you learn how Python works as a glue language.\nYou learn about Application Program Interfaces (APIs) and how and why to use\nthem. Similar to Lesson 2, when we read data into our program, you now learn\nhow we both read data in and push data out to other programs. This enables our\nprogram to talk to another program. Before we do so, we set a simulation so we\ncan isolate functionally before we hook it all up in Lesson 8.<br/><br/><b>Lesson\n8: Pie Store–Visuals UX/UI Design</b><br/>In this final lesson, we create\nour complete program and talk about the technology stack. We create a simple\nUser Interface for the browser, and we hook that up to our code. We learn about\na couple of open source libraries that provide some underlying functionality to\nsupport us in the task.<br/><br/><b>About LiveLessons Video Training</b><br/><br/>The LiveLessons Video Training series publishes hundreds of hands-on,\nexpert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics\ndesigned to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

Concurrency and parallelism in Python are essential when it comes to multiprocessing and multithreading; they behave differently, but their common aim is to reduce the execution time. This book serves as a comprehensive introduction to various advanced concepts in concurrent engineering and programming.\n</p><p>Mastering Concurrency in Python starts by introducing the concepts and principles in concurrency, right from Amdahl's Law to multithreading programming, followed by elucidating multiprocessing programming, web scraping, and asynchronous I/O, together with common problems that engineers and programmers face in concurrent programming. Next, the book covers a number of advanced concepts in Python concurrency and how they interact with the Python ecosystem, including the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). Finally, you'll learn how to solve real-world concurrency problems through examples.\n</p><p>By the end of the book, you will have gained extensive theoretical knowledge of concurrency and the ways in which concurrency is supported by the Python language\n</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Explore the concepts of concurrency in programming\n</li><li>Explore the core syntax and features that enable concurrency in Python\n</li><li>Understand the correct way to implement concurrency\n</li><li>Abstract methods to keep the data consistent in your program\n</li><li>Analyze problems commonly faced in concurrent programming\n</li><li>Use application scaffolding to design highly-scalable programs</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book is for developers who wish to build high-performance applications and learn about signle-core, multicore programming or distributed concurrency.

    "description": "<span><span><p><strong>More than 8 Hours of Video Instruction</strong></p><p><strong>Overview</strong></p><p><em>Advanced Web Development in Python with Django LiveLessons</em> is intended for people familiar with web development who understand the basics of Django and want to get more out of it but are unfamiliar with more difficult topics such as authentication, database query optimization, and caching. The course builds directly on top of Andrew Pinkham's previous course, Web Development in Python with Django LiveLessons, starting with the same code base where the class left off and building new features in the same project, making for a clear and clean learning progression. While the previous course is not a hard prerequisite, the prerequisites for that course and the concepts introduced in it will be necessary to understand the videos. A review lesson enables people to judge for themselves whether the course is appropriate for their level.</p><p><strong>About the Instructor</strong><br/><strong>Andrew Pinkham</strong> is the founder and lead engineer at JamBon Software, which provides development consulting services. He is the author of <em>Django Unleashed</em>¬†(Pearson) and a popular speaker at DjangoCon U.S., and provides instruction in Python and Django. Andrew specializes in web and mobile products and enjoys communicating complex ideas in simple ways. He is also passionate about usability, security, and distributed systems. He is a 2009 graduate of Dartmouth College and currently resides in Boston, Massachusetts.</p><p><strong>Skill Level</strong><br/>\nIntermediate</p><p><strong>Learn How To</strong><br/></p><ul><li>Write tests for Django</li><li>Implement authentication in Django</li><li>Optimize Django performance</li><li>Enhance applications</li><li>Enable user media and processing with a Celery queue</li><li>Utilize asynchronous Python</li></ul><p><strong>Who Should Take This Course</strong><br/>\nPython programmers and other software developers interested in leveraging the Django web framework to build web applications</p><p><strong>Course Requirements</strong><br/>\nPython programming experience</p><p><strong>Lesson Descriptions</strong></p><p><strong>Lesson 1:</strong>Dip Your Toes Into Test Writing<br/>\nLesson 1 starts off the course with testing, which is crucial to successful software development. The lesson begins by looking at the why, what, and how of testing, and then dives into how to test all the different components in Django. You also get a taste of Django's check framework.</p><p><strong>Lesson 2:</strong>Protect Site Access with Authentication<br/>\nLesson 2 starts with authentication, or login and logout, but the focus is not limited to just that. As always, the lesson begins by discussing the fundamentals, and then dives into how they work with Django. We'll build login and logout, views to allow users to change their password, views to allow people to reset forgotten passwords, and even set up new user registration.</p><p><strong>Lesson 3:</strong>Protect API Access with Authentication<br/>\nLesson 3 is about how to use authentication and authorization to protect API endpoints. While the fundamentals are similar to Lesson 2, the actual work is different. The lesson starts with implementing token authentication and then switches to a more robust OAuth 2 authentication system. Andrew switches up the testing gears in this lesson, using Postman to interact with our API.</p><p><strong>Lesson 4:</strong>Performance<br/>\nLesson 4 is about optimization. Andrew talks about how you should optimize a back-end web app and what common optimization problems are. You learn how to optimize database interactions when using models, and Andrew talks about how to improve the site with caching.</p><p><strong>Lesson 5:</strong>Enhance the Application with Pagination, Static Content, and a Sitemap<br/>\nLesson 5 adds a bit of polish to your website. You use some of Django's contributed library and generic views to make navigation easier. This includes adding a few pages to organize things alphabetically and by date, as well as how to generate RSS and Atom feeds and a sitemap for search engines. Finally, you add some basic CSS to your site.</p><p><strong>Lesson 6:</strong>Enabling User Media and Processing with a Celery Queue<br/>\nLesson 6 covers one of the places where Django needs a bit of help. The problem, in short, is that web browsers expect you to get a response back to them very quickly; however, sometimes you need to perform a computation for longer than that round-trip time. For your app to handle situations like these, you’ll need to offload work from Django to some other process. You learn how to use Celery and queues in tandem with Django to handle this sort of scenario.</p><p><strong>Lesson 7:</strong>Asynchronous Python\nLesson 7 delves into the changes happening in Python and Django. Andrew discusses Python's new async features, presents an example of using async in a different framework, and even leads you through programming an app that uses WebSockets as well as HTTP. Finally, Andrew discusses how these changes will affect Django in the near future.</p><p><strong>About Pearson Video Training</strong><br/>\nPearson publishes expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

In this video course Brian Overland teaches you the tools you’ll be expected to know to become a professional Python programmer. <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>About the Instructor <br/>\n</strong>\n<br/>\n<strong>Brian Overland</strong> is an experienced programming professional who has worked as a programmer, manager, and senior technical writer for Microsoft Corporation. He has also published a dozen titles on C, C++, Java, Visual Basic, and now Python. He has done programming work on contract, including an automated irrigation system for Walt Disney World, and he wrote some of the first programs ever written in Microsoft Visual Basic, including a calculator app, a Turing machine emulator, and many other applications. <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Skill Level</strong><br/>\n<ul><li>Intermediate</li></ul>\n<br/>\n<strong>Learn How To</strong><br/>\n<ul><li>Use list comprehension</li><li>Use set comprehension</li><li>Format text precisely</li><li>Implement multi-dimensional lists</li><li>Utilize decorators</li><li>Write generators</li><li>Store data in files efficiently</li><li>Understand Python classes and objects</li></ul>\n<br/>\n<strong>Who Should Take This Course</strong><br/>\n<ul><li>Anyone wanting to develop their basic Python skills to the level of a professional programmer</li></ul>\n<strong>Course Requirements</strong><br/>\n<ul><li>Basic Python programming skills</li></ul>\n<strong>Lesson Descriptions</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 1: List Comprehension</strong><br/>\nAnother name for list comprehension might be “list compaction.” It enables you to do more with less code. This capability is exemplified in the lesson with a classic programming challenge—writing a palindrome application. Brian shows you how to reduce the code you would normally write by 75% using list comprehension.\n<br/>\n\nTopics 1.1 and 1.2 introduce list comprehension and shows you how it works. Topic 1.3 introduces an optional but powerful feature: conditional inclusion. Finally, Topic 1.4 puts it all together to show you how to use list comprehension in an example that’s much, much shorter than the obvious way to do things.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 2: Sets and Set Comprehension</strong><br/>\nLesson 2 introduces sets. Yes, that’s the concept from math that you are already likely to be familiar with. The concept has great practical value, so much so that it’s a built-in feature of Python, just as legitimate as the concept of a list, string, or number.\n<br/>\n\nWhat’s really cool about sets is that the Python operations on sets precisely match the mathematical concepts. This includes unions, intersections, subsets, and so on.\n<br/>\n\nBut what are the practical uses of sets? You’ll see the usefulness of sets in this lesson, beginning with Topic 2.1, which introduces the concept, along with Topic 2.2, which presents set operations. Topic 2.3 introduces the famous “Sieve” application. Finally, Topic 2.4 shows how to use Python sets to create an incredibly efficient version of this classic programming benchmark.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 3: Formatting Text Precisely</strong><br/>\nFormatting text may not seem exciting at first, but it’s vital to the professional programmer. Think about it. How often does a company require reports to be written out nicely, with complex data printed in neat columns in which everything lines up?\n<br/>\n\nYou could do everything yourself, but to print those nice columns without help from Python, you’d being doing a great deal of extra work.<br/>\nPython comes to the rescue with not one but three formatting techniques. Do you have to master all three at once? No. But it’s useful to know about them, in case you want to use the more advanced approaches one day.\n<br/>\n\nTherefore, we start by looking at the simplest approach, the percent operator, in Topics 3.1 and 3.2. This operator is borrowed from the old C language, so you may already know how to use it. Then, in Topics 3.3 and 3.4, we look at the format function and the format method. Given the similarity in names, they ought to be related, and it turns out they are. But they have a similar purpose: to help you print nice-looking output without a lot of work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 4: Multi-Dimensional Lists</strong><br/>\nNo programming language is really complete without some way to handle multi-dimensional arrays—or as we call them in Python, multi-dimensional lists. They’re also called <em>matrixes</em>. Matrixes have important uses in game programming, simulations, linear algebra, and many other areas.\n<br/>\n\nBut this is one area in which Python throws you some “curveballs.” It’s surprising that this simple task—creating a matrix—is in some ways easier in C, C++, or Java than it is in Python.\n<br/>\n\nIf you want, you can always create matrixes with the Numpy package, which we may deal with in a future course. But in this lesson, I’ll show you how to create two-dimensional lists with the core Python language. The problem is that Python matrixes can’t be declared. They have to be built.\n<br/>\n\nTopic 4.1 shows some simple uses for Python 2D lists. Topic 4.2 shows why creating arbitrarily large matrixes in Python is not so easy. But the last two topics, 4.3 and 4.4, come to the rescue to show how to master the problem and even create higher-dimensional lists, if you want.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 5: Dictionaries</strong><br/>\nNext is an area of Python that seems truly magical: data dictionaries. Like the lists and set types, the dictionary is a fundamental data type in Python. In this lesson, you’ll see just what dictionaries can do. You can use a dictionary to look up data by providing a “key”—typically a string containing a meaningful name—which is usually much more convenient than using an index number.\n<br/>\n\nThis may not sound like much at first, but it opens up a world of possibilities. A data dictionary is like a rudimentary database system. Its basic operation is simple, but you can use it to do many things.\n<br/>\n\nThe first two topics, 5.1 and 5.2, show you some practical uses. Topic 5.3 is more practical still, showing you how to use a dictionary to count words and provide a frequency count. Topic 5.4 does the same thing, but it takes the input from a file. While we’re at it, we’ll review the principles of reading and writing text files.\n<br/>\n\nLest you think this is just busy work, it’s not. The capability to create frequency counts is an important part of computer algorithms such as Huffman encoding. By mastering tasks like these, you’re on your way to becoming a “real programmer” with Python.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 6: Generators</strong><br/>\nThis lesson and the next get into some very special features of Python that you won’t find in most other languages. They are unique, or nearly unique, to Python. One of these is the “generator” technology.\n<br/>\n\nPerhaps the most basic concept throughout Python is that of an “iterator,” or rather “iterable,” which is the other side of the same coin. An iterator is any sequence that can be stepped through, one item at a time. Lists are iterables, but you can create your own iterable by writing a generator function. This is a really cool technique that gives you tremendous flexibility.\n<br/>\n\nFirst, we look at the rationale for writing a generator rather than a list in Topic 6.1. Topic 6.2 explains how generators work and what makes them different. Then, in Topics 6.3 and 6.4, we look at some highly practical uses for generators and why you want to put them in your programs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 7: Decorators</strong><br/>\nFew Python topics have a reputation for being more difficult than the subject of decorators. The subject is not so difficult; the problem is that it’s usually not taught very well. If you’ve heard about this subject or found it difficult to learn, well then, rest easy! Because you’ve finally come to the right place.\n<br/>\n\nPython “decoration” is simply a way of adding extra code to functions and then automating the process. In Topic 7.1, Brian talks about why this is such a great and useful tool, especially if you want to profile, or time, your functions. Topic 7.2 presents an example of a simple decorator.\n<br/>\n\nThe last two topics, 7.3 and 7.4, complete the process by showing the complete syntax you need to master to understand decorators.<br/>\nAgain, this is not an impossible subject to understand, or even all that difficult. This lesson will give you the understanding you need.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 8: Classes and Objects, Part I</strong><br/>\nThe final subject of the course is classes and objects. These concepts are so interrelated that they really must be covered together. But this subject—object-oriented programming—is such a big one, that it takes two complete lessons just to give you a good introduction to the topic.\n<br/>\n\nYou may well have come across this subject before, when working with languages such as C++, C#, and Java. But it’s more than just using the “dot” syntax. It’s about creating data types that are active, that can be called upon to perform services.\n<br/>\n\nOnce again, Python—although it’s mostly easier for beginners—throws some curveballs at you. As you’ll see in Topics 8.1 and 8.2, it requires a little extra work to create a class with simple initialization.\n<br/>\n\nThe other side of this coin is that Python classes are incredibly convenient, as they support many “magic methods” that automatically perform important services for you. In Topic 8.3, you’ll see how the __str__ method performs automatic printing of objects. Finally, in Topic 8.4, you’ll see how to make your objects perform any kind of service you want.\n<br/>\n\nIn the long run, you’ll find Python classes easy to code and sometimes great time-savers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 9: Classes and Objects II, Data Recs</strong><br/>\nThe archetypal model for classes and objects is that of a data record, but a class is much more, of course. Think of a class, or an object, as a “data record plus.” It’s “More than a Data Record!” This lesson starts by showing a typical data record—this one stores information on your company’s employees. Topic 9.1 shows you how to create this type, and Topic 9.2 shows you how to automatically print employee-record objects, in any format you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what good is storing data if you can’t enter it easily? Topic 9.3 illustrates a data-entry routine that will make it a breeze to work with the new Employee class.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, we end this course with Topic 9.4, by showing the best way to store a series of records in a binary file—and then read them out. This section introduces the super-convenient Python “pickle” package, which is by far the easiest way to work with binary data.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>About Pearson Video Training</strong> <br/>\nPearson publishes expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

While readers must understand the basics of Python programming, no knowledge of modular programming techniques is required.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Learn how to use modules and packages to organize your Python code</li><li>Understand how to use the import statement to load modules and packages into your program</li><li>Use common module patterns such as abstraction and encapsulation to write better programs</li><li>Discover how to create self-testing Python packages</li><li>Create reusable modules that other programmers can use</li><li>Learn how to use GitHub and the Python Package Index to share your code with other people</li><li>Make use of modules and packages that others have written</li><li>Use modular techniques to build robust systems that can handle complexity and changing requirements over time</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Python has evolved over the years and has become the primary choice of developers in various fields. The purpose of this book is to help readers develop readable, reliable, and maintainable programs in Python.</p><p>Starting with an introduction to the concept of modules and packages, this book shows how you can use these building blocks to organize a complex program into logical parts and make sure those parts are working correctly together.</p><p>Using clearly written, real-world examples, this book demonstrates how you can use modular techniques to build better programs. A number of common modular programming patterns are covered, including divide-and-conquer, abstraction, encapsulation, wrappers and extensibility. You will also learn how to test your modules and packages, how to prepare your code for sharing with other people, and how to publish your modules and packages on GitHub and the Python Package Index so that other people can use them. Finally, you will learn how to use modular design techniques to be a more effective programmer.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This book will be simple and straightforward, focusing on imparting learning through a wide array of examples that the readers can put into use as they read through the book. They should not only be able to understand the way modules help in improving development, but they should also be able to improvise on their techniques of writing concise and effective code.</p></span>",

The basic principles of Object Oriented Programming are relatively easy to learn. Putting them together into working designs can be challenging.</p><p>This book makes programming more of a pleasure than a chore using powerful Python 3 object-oriented features of Python 3. It clearly demonstrates the core OOP principles and how to correctly implement OOP in Python.</p><p>Object Oriented Programming ranks high in importance among the many models Python supports. Yet, many programmers never bother learning the powerful features that make this language object oriented.</p><p>The book teaches when and how OOP should be correctly applied. It emphasizes not only the simple syntax of OOP in Python, but also how to combine these objects into well-designed software.</p><p>This book will introduce you to the terminology of the object-oriented paradigm, focusing on object-oriented design with step-by-step examples. It will take you from simple inheritance, one of the most useful tools in the object-oriented programmer's toolbox, all the way through to cooperative inheritance, one of the most complicated. You will be able to raise, handle, define, and manipulate exceptions.</p><p>You will be able to integrate the object-oriented and the not-so-object-oriented aspects of Python. You will also be able to create maintainable applications by studying higher level design patterns. You'll learn the complexities of string and file manipulation, and how Python distinguishes between binary and textual data. Not one, but two very powerful automated testing systems will be introduced to you. You'll understand the joy of unit testing and just how easy they are to create. You'll even study higher level libraries such as database connectors and GUI toolkits and how they apply object-oriented principles.</p><p>Harness the power of Python 3 objects; it's not just a scripting language</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>Python is growing in popularity; based on download statistics, there are  now over 450,000 people using Python, and more than 150,000 people using Python  on Windows.  Use of the language has been growing at about 40% per year since  1995, and there is every reason to believe that growth will continue.Despite Python's increasing popularity on Windows, <i>Python Programming on  Win32</i> is the first book to demonstrate how to use it as a serious Windows  development and administration tool.  Unlike scripting on Unix, Windows  scripting involves integrating a number of components, such as COM or the  various mail and database APIs, with the Win32 programming interface.   While experienced Windows C++ programmers can find their way through the  various objects, most people need some guidance, and this book is it.  It  addresses all the basic technologies for common integration tasks on Windows,  explaining both the Windows issues and the Python code you need to glue things  together.Topics include:</p><ul><li>The Python language and the PythonWin extensions</li><li>Building a GUI with COM</li><li>Adding a Macro language</li><li>Distributing the application</li><li>Client-side COM for output and data access</li><li>Integration with mail and other internet protocols</li><li>Managing users and drives</li></ul>This is a vital and unique book.  <i>Python Programming on Win32</i> is an excellent presentation of Windows application development and a solid  illustration of how to use Python in the Windows environment.</div></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>This book offers Python programmers one place to look when they needhelp remembering or deciphering the syntax of this open source languageand its many powerful but scantily documented modules. Thiscomprehensive reference guide makes it easy to look up the mostfrequently needed information--not just about the Python languageitself, but also the most frequently used parts of the standard libraryand the most important third-party extensions. </p><p>Ask any Python aficionado and you'll hear that Python programmers haveit all: an elegant object-oriented language with readable andmaintainable syntax, that allows for easy integration with componentsin C, C++, Java, or C#, and an enormous collection of precoded standardlibrary and third-party extension modules. Moreover, Python is easy tolearn, yet powerful enough to take on the most ambitious programmingchallenges. But what Python programmers used to lack is a concise andclear reference resource, with the appropriate measure of guidance inhow best to use Python's great power. <i>Python in aNutshell</i> fills this need. </p><p><i>Python in a Nutshell</i>, Second Edition covers morethan the language itself; it also deals with the mostfrequently used parts of the standard library, and the most popular andimportant third party extensions. Revised and expanded forPython 2.5, this book now contains the gory details of Python's newsubprocess module and breaking news about Microsoft's newIronPython project. Our \"Nutshell\" format fits Python perfectly bypresenting the highlights of the most important modules and functionsin its standard library, which cover over 90% of your practicalprogramming needs. This book includes:</p><ul><li>A fast-paced tutorial on the syntax of the Python language</li><li>An explanation of object-oriented programming in Python </li><li>Coverage of iterators, generators, exceptions, modules,packages, strings, and regular expressions</li><li>A quick reference for Python's built-in types and functionsand key modules </li><li>Reference material on important third-party extensions,such as Numeric and Tkinter</li><li>Information about extending and embedding Python </li></ul><p><i>Python in a Nutshell</i> provides a solid,no-nonsense quick reference to information that programmers rely on themost. This book will immediately earn its place in any Pythonprogrammer's library.</p><p>Praise for the First Edition:<br/></p><p>\"In a nutshell, <i>Python in a Nutshell</i> serves oneprimary goal: to act as an immediately accessible goal for the Pythonlanguage. True, you can get most of the same core information that ispresented within the covers of this volume online, but this willinvariably be broken into multiple files, and in all likelihood lackingthe examples or the exact syntax description necessary to trulyunderstand a command.\"<br/>--Richard Cobbett, <i>Linux Format</i><br/></p><p>\"O'Reilly has several good books, of which <i>Python in aNutshell</i> by Alex Martelli is probably the best for giving yousome idea of what Python is about and how to do useful things with it.\"<br/>--Jerry Pournelle, <i>Byte Magazine</i></p></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p><b>Python: Create-Modify-Reuse</b> is designed for all levels of Python developers interested in a practical, hands-on way of learning Python development. This book is designed to show you how to use Python (in combination with the raw processing power of your computer) to accomplish real-world tasks in a more efficient way. Don't look for an exhaustive description of the Python language--you won't find it. The book's main purpose is not to thoroughly cover the Python language, but rather to show how you can use Python to create robust, real-world applications.</p><p>In this respect, the goal is similar to foreign-language books that identify themselves as \"conversational,\" focusing on the vocabulary and concepts that people will need the most. Likewise, I focus specifically on the Python knowledge needed to accomplish practical, specific tasks. Along the way, you will learn to create useful, efficient scripts that are easy to maintain and enhance.</p><p>This book is for developers with some experience with Python who want to explore how to develop full-blown applications. It is also for developers with experience in other languages who want to learn Python by building robust applications. It is well-suited for developers who like to \"learn by doing,\" rather than exploring a language feature by feature. To get the most out of the book, you should understand basic programming principles.</p><p>Because this book is project-based, you can approach it in numerous ways. You can, of course, read it from cover to cover. Chapters 2 through 8 each cover a different project, so the chapters are independent of each other. However, because each chapter project is covered individually, there may be some overlap of information. I also sometimes refer to explanations of particular topics covered in previous chapters. This will help to reinforce important concepts.</p><p>The end of the book contains two appendixes. The first one is a listing of Python resources you can check out for more information. The second one will help you with installing additional components used in some of the examples.</p><p>This book starts with a basic overview of the Python language, designed for those familiar with other languages but new to Python. It is followed by several chapters, each of which describes a complete project that can be used as-is or modified and extended to suit your particular purposes. You'll find applications that access databases, take advantage of web technologies, and facilitate network communications, to name a few. In addition, and more important than the technologies you will be introduced to, you will learn how to use Python to solve real challenges. Following these chapters are two chapters that cover accessing operating system resources and debugging and testing, respectively.</p><p>Each project chapter contains complete instructions describing how to install and use the application, so you can actually see the program run as you learn how to construct and use it, including how the project was designed and prototyped. This book is intended to be both a reference guide and a learning aid, teaching you how to build solutions with Python and providing reference information on a wide variety of Python programming concepts.</p><p>It is hoped that this book will help you have fun with Python and build useful applications, and—unlike my experience with building a deck—without sore thumbs.</p><p>This book is framed around the code itself. This is because developers are typically looking for how to do something; and, as with many activities, you learn how to do something by watching how others do and trying it yourself. If you want to know how a <code>for</code> loop works, you'll find <code>for</code> loops in my code, but that's not the thrust of the book. Instead, this book shows you how to do things: how to build a content management system, how to build a test management system, how to set up a system for tracking customer follow-up, and so on. Along the way, you'll learn how to communicate with a SQL database, how to act as a web server or communicate with one, how to access operating system services, and more.</p><p>There are three basic components to the book:</p><ul><li><p>Chapter 1 is a brief overview of the Python language.</p></li><li><p>Chapters 2–8 cover seven different programming projects, which illustrate various technologies and techniques available to Python developers.</p></li><li><p>Chapters 9–10 cover additional, advanced topics, which will help you as you build Python projects.</p></li></ul><p>The project chapters have a consistent structure:</p><ul><li><p>Overview: What does the application do?</p></li><li><p>Using the program</p></li><li><p>Design</p></li><li><p>How it all fits together</p></li><li><p>Modules involved</p></li><li><p>Code and code explanation</p></li><li><p>Module/class 1 explanation</p></li><li><p>Module/class 2 explanation</p></li><li><p>Minor code file explanation</p></li><li><p>Testing, including suggested tests</p></li><li><p>Modifying the project, including some suggested adaptations</p></li><li><p>Summary</p></li></ul><p>Each project is designed with classes that can be reused and accessed for multiple purposes. This is one of the main benefits of object-oriented programming, so designing for reusability is a main focus of the book. The book contains the following chapters:</p><ol><li><p>Python Basics</p><p>This chapter is a basic primer on the Python language, and it functions as either a quick tutorial for experienced programmers new to Python or a refresher for programmers with Python experience.</p><p>Part I: The Projects</p></li><li><p>Directory/File Snapshot Program</p><p>This project demonstrates how to interact with files, create and manipulate data structures, and provide user output. It also touches on code design issues to improve code maintainability. Often when installing or uninstalling software, or verifying changes to a file system, it can be valuable to take a \"snapshot\" of the files and directories, along with their size and last-modified time. The script introduced in this chapter does just that. This chapter also explores how to capture a directory listing into a Python list, and explains how to query this list for particular values.</p></li><li><p>DVD Inventory System</p><p>This project takes advantage of Python's capability to access and manipulate data in a SQL database. The application enables multiple users to log in to a website that provides access to a DVD inventory database. Permissions are set such that some users can add, modify, or delete entries, whereas other users have read-only access to the data.</p></li><li><p>Web Performance Tester</p><p>This project shows how to communicate with a Python web server and retrieve information regarding how long it takes to receive requested items from the web server. Although writing Python programs to work on a single computer can be useful, the real power of Python can be seen when it is used to script communication between computers on a network. Most networks contain several web servers. A nice feature of Python is that it can act as a lightweight server for various Internet protocols, such as HTTP (web) and ftp. This application enables you to monitor performance of HTTP traffic on your network.</p></li><li><p>Customer Follow-Up System</p><p>This project shows how to present a web form to the user and retrieve data from it, how to automatically format and send e-mail through an SMTP server, and how to generate an HTML-formatted report. The task for the second example is to automatically generate a customer comments e-mail message based on information the customer enters in a form. It uses the <code>mod_python</code> Apache module to take the information entered in the HTTP form and then utilizes a Python script on the web server to send that information to an SMTP server for mail delivery.</p></li><li><p>Test Management/Reporting System</p><p>This project makes use of the <code>unittest</code> module to run tests against an existing application, and creates a framework for reporting test results. Testing is a vital process for developing software. This application enables users to run tests for a given piece of software, to list the previous test runs by date, to show test run results for any previously run tests, and to output the results of any test run as HTML for viewing in a web browser.</p></li><li><p>Version Management System</p><p>This project connects to a list of servers via telnet, checks the application version of a pre-set application list, and displays its results both as output and to a log file. Often, a system administrator needs to patch systems or ensure that systems have the latest application versions installed. This script is an easy way to accomplish that task. It makes use of Python's capability to emulate a telnet client and log in to remote systems and perform functions on that remote system.</p></li><li><p>Content Management System</p><p>This project explores Plone, a popular content management system based on Python and Zope (a Python-based application server). Because Python is a very mature language, numerous applications have been built on top of it. A great thing about working with Python-based applications is that you get the benefit of a full-blown application but you can still use Python to configure and customize it.</p><p>Part II: Advanced Topics</p></li><li><p>Interacting with the Operating System</p><p>When writing scripts \"in the real world,\" often it is critical to be able to access services available through (and particular to) the operating system you happen to be on. For example, suppose you wanted to read or modify the Window Registry? Or you wanted to get the Linux process ID of a particular process that is running? Is such a thing even possible? Definitely—and this chapter shows you how.</p></li><li><p>Debugging and Testing</p><p>Because I am a software tester myself, testing is a subject that is certainly close to my heart. In...</p></li></ol></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><b>A comprehensive guide to exploring modern Python through data structures, design patterns, and effective object-oriented techniques</b></p><h4>Key Features</h4><ul><li>Build an intuitive understanding of object-oriented design, from introductory to mature programs</li><li>Learn the ins and outs of Python syntax, libraries, and best practices</li><li>Examine a machine-learning case study at the end of each chapter</li></ul><h4>Book Description</h4><p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a popular design paradigm in which data and behaviors are encapsulated in such a way that they can be manipulated together. Python Object-Oriented Programming, Fourth Edition dives deep into the various aspects of OOP, Python as an OOP language, common and advanced design patterns, and hands-on data manipulation and testing of more complex OOP systems. These concepts are consolidated by open-ended exercises, as well as a real-world case study at the end of every chapter, newly written for this edition. All example code is now compatible with Python 3.9+ syntax and has been updated with type hints for ease of learning.</p><p>Steven and Dusty provide a comprehensive, illustrative tour of important OOP concepts, such as inheritance, composition, and polymorphism, and explain how they work together with Python's classes and data structures to facilitate good design. In addition, the book also features an in-depth look at Python's exception handling and how functional programming intersects with OOP. Two very powerful automated testing systems, unittest and pytest, are introduced. The final chapter provides a detailed discussion of Python's concurrent programming ecosystem.</p><p>By the end of the book, you will have a thorough understanding of how to think about and apply object-oriented principles using Python syntax and be able to confidently create robust and reliable programs.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Implement objects in Python by creating classes and defining methods</li><li>Extend class functionality using inheritance</li><li>Use exceptions to handle unusual situations cleanly</li><li>Understand when to use object-oriented features, and more importantly, when not to use them</li><li>Discover several widely used design patterns and how they are implemented in Python</li><li>Uncover the simplicity of unit and integration testing and understand why they are so important</li><li>Learn to statically type check your dynamic code</li><li>Understand concurrency with asyncio and how it speeds up programs</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>If you are new to object-oriented programming techniques, or if you have basic Python skills and wish to learn how and when to correctly apply OOP principles in Python, this is the book for you. Moreover, if you are an object-oriented programmer coming from other languages or seeking a leg up in the new world of Python, you will find this book a useful introduction to Python. Minimal previous experience with Python is necessary.</p></span>",

In most of the cases, Boto3 works along with Lambda and that's the reason we combine Boto3 and Lambda into one course. We have divided the course into two parts to get more clarity about Boto3 and Lambda. Part 1 is about how to write and execute Python Boto3 on our local server or any OS. Part 2 is about writing and executing Python Boto3 in Lambda with different triggering methods.</p><p>Boto3 is the name of the Python SDK for AWS or Boto3 is the Python module to work with AWS services using Python scripts. It allows you to create, update, and delete AWS services from our Python scripts without opening AWS management console through the browser; we can execute these Python Boto3 scripts either from our local server or using AWS Lambda service.</p><p>In this course, we will see how to implement and execute Python Boto3 scripts on our local server; then, we will move on with AWS Lambda service. Boto3 is built on top of the Botocore module. We will also explore the different types of Boto3 sessions and the concepts of Boto3 to write Python scripts for AWS automation.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will get the knowledge to apply different concepts of Boto3 and Lambda for different AWS services.</p><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p>This course is designed for individuals looking to master Boto3 and AWS Lambda functions with different triggering method skills to automate tasks in real time.</p></span>",

What’s the next step toward becoming a capable, confident software developer?</p><p>Welcome to <i>Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python</i>. More than a mere collection of advanced syntax and masterful tips for writing clean code, you’ll learn how to advance your Python programming skills by using the command line and other professional tools like code formatters, type checkers, linters, and version control. Sweigart takes you through best practices for setting up your development environment, naming variables, and improving readability, then tackles documentation, organization and performance measurement, as well as object-oriented design and the Big-O algorithm analysis commonly used in coding interviews. The skills you learn will boost your ability to program—not just in Python but in any language.</p><p>You’ll learn:</p><p>•Coding style, and how to use Python’s Black auto-formatting tool for cleaner code<br/>•Common sources of bugs, and how to detect them with static analyzers<br/>•How to structure the files in your code projects with the Cookiecutter template tool<br/>•Functional programming techniques like lambda and higher-order functions<br/>•How to profile the speed of your code with Python’s built-in timeit and cProfile modules<br/>•The computer science behind Big-O algorithm analysis<br/>•How to make your comments and docstrings informative, and how often to write them<br/>•How to create classes in object-oriented programming, and why they’re used to organize code</p><p>Toward the end of the book you’ll read a detailed source-code breakdown of two classic command-line games, the Tower of Hanoi (a logic puzzle) and Four-in-a-Row (a two-player tile-dropping game), and a breakdown of how their code follows the book’s best practices. You’ll test your skills by implementing the program yourself.</p><p>Of course, no single book can make you a professional software developer. But <i>Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python</i> will get you further down that path and make you a better programmer in the process as you learn to write readable code that’s easy to debug and perfectly Pythonic.</p></div></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>\nPython exceptions are exceptional at helping your program take decisions. It is natural to feel the urge to catch them all and ignore them. But powerful programs can be created by learning how to leverage them in order to make robust scripts and take your coding skills to the next level. In this video, I cover several techniques that will help you improve your exception handling.\n<br/>\nTopics include:\n<br/>\n* Create a script that uses exception poorly, and then improve it\n<br/>\n* Slowly clean up broad catching exceptions to improve the script\n<br/>\n* Learn how to produce better errors from exceptions\n<br/>\n* Leverage other tools like logging to produce meaningful errors and tracebacks while keeping messages clean\n<br/>\n\nFollow along the repository to continue using more examples: https://github.com/alfredodeza/exceptions/\n</p></span>",

Learn about design, algorithms, testing, and debugging. Discover the fundamentals of programming with Python 3.6--a language that's used in millions of devices. Write programs to solve real-world problems, and come away with everything you need to produce quality code. This edition has been updated to use the new language features in Python 3.6.</p><p>No programming experience required! Incremental examples show you the steps and missteps that happen while developing programs, so you know what to expect when you tackle a problem on your own. Inspired by \"How to Design Programs\" (HtDP), discover a five-step recipe for designing functions, which helps you learn the concepts--and becomes an integral part of writing programs.</p><p>In this detailed introduction to Python and to computer programming, find out exactly what happens when your programs are executed. Work with numbers, text, big data sets, and files using real-world examples. Create and use your own data types. Make your programs reliable, work with databases, download data from the web automatically, and build user interfaces. As you use the fundamental programming tools in this book, you'll see how to document and organize your code so that you and other programmers can more easily read and understand it. This new edition takes advantage of Python 3.6's new features, including type annotations on parameters, return types and variable declarations, and changes to string formatting.</p><p>Most importantly, you'll learn how to think like a professional programmer.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>You'll need to download Python 3.6, available from <a href=\"https://python.org.With\">https://python.org.With</a> that download comes IDLE, the editor we use for writing andrunning Python programs.  (If you use Linux, you may need to installPython 3.6 and IDLE separately.)</p></div></span>",

If you are a Python programmer who wants to code efficiently by getting the syntax and usage of a few intricate Python techniques exactly right, this book is for you.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Create a virtualenv and start a new project</li><li>Understand how and when to use the functional programming paradigm</li><li>Get familiar with the different ways the decorators can be written in</li><li>Understand the power of generators and coroutines without digressing into lambda calculus</li><li>Create metaclasses and how it makes working with Python far easier</li><li>Generate HTML documentation out of documents and code using Sphinx</li><li>Learn how to track and optimize application performance, both memory and cpu</li><li>Use the multiprocessing library, not just locally but also across multiple machines</li><li>Get a basic understanding of packaging and creating your own libraries/applications</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Python is a dynamic programming language. It is known for its high readability and hence it is often the first language learned by new programmers. Python being multi-paradigm, it can be used to achieve the same thing in different ways and it is compatible across different platforms. Even if you find writing Python code easy, writing code that is efficient, easy to maintain, and reuse is not so straightforward.</p><p>This book is an authoritative guide that will help you learn new advanced methods in a clear and contextualised way. It starts off by creating a project-specific environment using venv, introducing you to different Pythonic syntax and common pitfalls before moving on to cover the functional features in Python. It covers how to create different decorators, generators, and metaclasses. It also introduces you to functools.wraps and coroutines and how they work. Later on you will learn to use asyncio module for asynchronous clients and servers. You will also get familiar with different testing systems such as py.test, doctest, and unittest, and debugging tools such as Python debugger and faulthandler. You will learn to optimize application performance so that it works efficiently across multiple machines and Python versions. Finally, it will teach you how to access C functions with a simple Python call. By the end of the book, you will be able to write more advanced scripts and take on bigger challenges.</p><p><b>Style and Approach</b></p><p>This book is a comprehensive guide that covers advanced features of the Python language, and communicate them with an authoritative understanding of the underlying rationale for how, when, and why to use them.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book.

It is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It is often used as a scripting language because of its forgiving syntax and compatibility with a wide variety of different eco-systems. Python GUI Programming Cookbook follows a task-based approach to help you create beautiful and very effective GUIs with the least amount of code necessary.</p><p>This book will guide you through the very basics of creating a fully functional GUI in Python with only a few lines of code. Each and every recipe adds more widgets to the GUIs we are creating. While the cookbook recipes all stand on their own, there is a common theme running through all of them. As our GUIs keep expanding, using more and more widgets, we start to talk to networks, databases, and graphical libraries that greatly enhance our GUI’s functionality. This book is what you need to expand your knowledge on the subject of GUIs, and make sure you’re not missing out in the long run.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This programming cookbook consists of standalone recipes, and this approach makes it unique.. While each recipe explains a certain concept, throughout the book you’ll build a more and more advanced GUI, recipe after recipe. In some of the advanced topics, we simply create a new GUI in order to explore these topics in depth.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book.

It gives beginners a simple way to start programming, but Python's standard library also provides numerous packages that allow Python-using secret agents to easily utilize very sophisticated information processing.</p><p>This book will guide new field agent trainees through putting together a Python-based toolset to gather, analyze, and communicate data. It starts by covering the basics and then moves on to sections such as file exchange, image processing, geocoding, simple trigonometry, and more sensitive statistical processing. You will then learn how to use polynomials to encode and decode data in different representations. Furthermore, this book shows you how to add tools to a Python environment, work with images, and parse HTML web pages to extract meaningful data. The idea of adding packages to Python is central to how an agent will leverage these tools for data processing.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Quickly get to grips with using Python to create tools and solve problems</li><li>Manipulate image files and learn how to encode messages into an image using steganography</li><li>Gather a file's hidden secrets, such as EXIF data and ZIP archive contents</li><li>Build applications that access, filter, and analyze live data from the Web</li><li>Design Python modules, libraries, and applications</li><li>Customize your Python environment with specialized packages</li><li>Extract data using HTTP and FTP internetworking protocols</li></ul></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Get started in the world of software development: go from zero knowledge of programming to comfortably writing small to medium-sized programs in Python. Programming can be intimidating (especially when most books on software require you to know and use obscure command line instructions) but it doesn't have to be that way!</p><p>In <i>Learn to Program with Python</i>, author <b>Irv Kalb</b> uses his in-person teaching experience to guide you through learning the Python computer programming language. He uses a conversational style to make you feel as though he is your personal tutor. All material is laid out in a thoughtful manner, each lesson building on previous ones. Many real-world analogies make the material easy to relate to. A wide variety of well-documented examples are provided. Along the way, you'll develop small programs on your own through a series of coding challenges that reinforce the content of the chapters.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li><p>Learn fundamental programming concepts including: variables and assignment statements, functions, conditionals, loops, lists, strings, file input and output, Internet data, and data structures</p></li><li><p>Get comfortable with the free IDLE Interactive Development Environment (IDE), which you will use to write and debug all your Python code - no need to use the command line!</p></li><li><p>Build text-based programs, including a number of simple games</p></li><li><p>Learn how to re-use code by building your own modules</p></li><li><p>Use Python's built-in data structures and packages to represent and make use of complex data from the Internet</p></li></ul><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>This book assumes that you have absolutely no prior knowledge about programming. There is no need to learn or use any obscure Unix commands. Students of any age who have had no exposure to programming and are interested in learning to do software development in the Python language. The book can be used as a text book associated with a high school or college introduction to computer science course. Secondly, people who have had exposure to some computer language other than Python, who would like to build good habits for programming in Python.</p></span>",

You'll then move from generic optimization techniques onto Python-specific ones, going over the main constructs of the language that will help you improve your speed without much of a change. Finally, the book covers some number-crunching-specific libraries and how to use them properly to get the best speed out of them.</p><p>After reading this book, you will know how to take any Python code, profile it, find out where the bottlenecks are, and apply different techniques to remove them.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This easy-to-follow, practical guide will help you enhance your optimization skills by improving real-world code.</p></span>",

The first book written from a\ncompletely “Python 3” viewpoint, <b><em>Programming in\nPython 3</em></b> brings together all the knowledge you need to\nwrite any program, use any standard or third-party Python 3\nlibrary, and create new library modules of your own.</p><p>Summerfield draws on his many years of\nPython experience to share deep insights into Python 3 development\nyou won’t find anywhere else. He begins by illuminating\nPython’s “beautiful heart”: the eight key\nelements of Python you need to write robust, high-performance\nprograms. Building on these core elements, he introduces new topics\ndesigned to strengthen your practical expertise–one concept\nand hands-on example at a time.

Moreover, Python is easy to learn\nbut powerful enough to take on the most ambitious programming\nchallenges. But what Python programmers have lacked is one concise\nand clear reference resource, with the appropriate measure of\nguidance in how best to use Python's great power. Now <em>Python in\na Nutshell</em> fills this need. In the tradition of O'Reilly's \"In\na Nutshell\" series, this book offers Python programmers one place\nto look when they need help remembering or deciphering the syntax\nof this open source language and its many modules.

    "description": "<span><span><p><em>Programming Python</em> focuses on advanced uses of the Python\nprogramming/scripting language, which has evolved from an emerging\nlanguage of interest primarily to pioneers, to a widely accepted\ntool that traditional programmers use for real day-to-day\ndevelopment tasks. With Python, you can do almost anything you can\ndo with C++; but Python is an interpreted language designed for\nrapid application development and deployment. Among other things,\nPython supports object-oriented programming; a remarkably simple,\nreadable, and maintainable syntax; integration with C components;\nand a vast collection of pre-coded interfaces and utilities. As\nPython has grown to embrace developers on a number of different\nplatforms (Unix, Linux, Windows, Mac), companies have taken notice\nand are adopting Python for their products. It has shown up\nanimating the latest Star Wars movie, serving up maps and\ndirectories on the Internet, guiding users through Linux\ninstallations, testing chips and boards, managing Internet\ndiscussion forums, scripting online games, and even scripting\nwireless products. <em>Programming Python</em> is the most\ncomprehensive resource for advanced Python programmers available\ntoday. Reviewed and endorsed by Python creator Guido van Rossum,\nwho also provides the foreword, this book zeroes in on real-world\nPython applications. It's been updated for Python 2.0 and covers\nInternet scripting, systems programming, Tkinter GUIs, C\nintegration domains, and new Python tools and applications. Among\nthem: IDLE, JYthon, Active Scripting and COM extensions, Zope, PSP\nserver pages, restricted execution mode, the HTMLgen and SWIG code\ngenerators, thread support, CGI and Internet protocol modules. Such\napplications are the heart and soul of this second edition. Veteran\nO'Reilly author Mark Lutz has included a platform-neutral CD-ROM\nwith book examples and various Python-related packages, including\nthe full Python 2.0 source code distribution.\n</p></span></span>",

In this fully revised edition, explore pytest's superpowers - simple asserts, fixtures, parametrization, markers, and plugins - while creating simple tests and test suites against a small database application. Using a robust yet simple fixture model, it's just as easy to write small tests with pytest as it is to scale up to complex functional testing. This book shows you how.</p><p>pytest is undeniably the best choice for testing Python projects. It's a full-featured, flexible, and extensible testing framework. pytest's fixture model allows you to share test data and setup procedures across multiple layers of tests. The pytest framework gives you powerful features such as assert rewriting, parametrization, markers, plugins, parallel test execution, and clear test failure reporting - with no boilerplate code.</p><p>With simple step-by-step instructions and sample code, this book gets you up to speed quickly on this easy-to-learn yet powerful tool. Write short, maintainable tests that elegantly express what you're testing. Speed up test times by distributing tests across multiple processors and running tests in parallel. Use Python's builtin assert statements instead of awkward assert helper functions to make your tests more readable. Move setup code out of tests and into fixtures to separate setup failures from test failures. Test error conditions and corner cases with expected exception testing, and use one test to run many test cases with parameterized testing. Extend pytest with plugins, connect it to continuous integration systems, and use it in tandem with tox, mock, coverage, and even existing unittest tests.</p><p>Write simple, maintainable tests quickly with pytest.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>The examples in this book were written using Python 3.10 and pytest 7. pytest 7 supports Python 3.5 and above.</p></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>Want to create cool games and apps to impress your friends (or yourself), but not sure where to start? Or, have you tried your hand at programming, but got utterly bored after combing through hundreds of pages of dry text? Then you’ve come to the right place! This book is the perfect blend of education and fun for kids 8 years and above looking to learn the magic of Python, one of the easiest and most powerful programming languages around, all while solving fun puzzles and building your own projects on the way. </p><p>Yes, there’ll be chapters on the fundamentals of Python, such as variables, numbers, strings, automation with conditions, loops and functions, objects, and files. But, early on in the book you’ll get started with Turtle, a Python package that was custom-made for kids like you. It lets you literally draw and animate on your computer! Every concept will be interspersed with a fun mini project with Turtle, so you’ll never get bored. Once you get the fundamentals down, you’ll dive right into Tkinter and Pygame, more fun Python packages (goodbye theory!) and you’ll learn all about creating apps and games like the ones you see and use every day (bouncing ball, temperature converter, calculator, rock-paper-scissors, and so much more!). </p><p>There are also four capstone projects at the end of the book that convert everything you’ve learned so far into full-blown apps and games that you can show off to your friends, parents, and even teachers! You’ll be creating a snake game with Turtle, a tic tac toe game with Tkinter, a full-fledged paint app, again with Tkinter, and finally, a classic space shooters game with Pygame (the cherry on top). Every project chapter will be accompanied with the logic behind the game/app and an explanation on how you’ve arrived at the logic. You’ll develop strong problem solving skills that’ll help you create future projects on your own.</p><p>There are also two chapters dedicated to just creating fun mini projects and puzzles, one of them placed in the middle of the book to give you a welcome break from all the learning. The book ends with an overview on web development with Python and ideas for more fun projects and puzzles you can solve on your own. Become the “most likely to succeed” kid in your grade while having the most fun getting there!</p><p> <b>What You'll Learn</b></p><ul><li>Gain      a gentle, but thorough introduction into the world of programming and      Python</li><li>Create      programs and solve problems with core Python concepts</li><li>Build      mini projects and capstone projects (showcase worthy) with Turtle,      Tkinter, and Pygame </li><li>Develop      programming skills while doing the puzzles and activities described in the      book </li></ul></div><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b><br/></div><div><div><br/></div><div>Kids 8 years and above.</div><p></p></div></span>",

Python was created with beginners in mind, but don't let its simple nature fool you. It is used by professional developers in a wide range of applications, such as web programming, data analysis, machine learning, and DevOps. While most introductory courses focus on the basics of the language, this course goes one step further to explain how Python is used in practice in the fields of data analysis and web development.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nStudents learn fundamental programming concepts, such as conditionals, loops, and functions. They are given hands-on, modular problems to solve so they can progress as they go. Finally, students tie it all together and experiment with some real programming in the form of text-based games.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nThe overall goal of this course is to help absolute beginners learn from scratch, navigate the world of software development, and then kick-start their programming journey with introductions to two of the more common uses of Python: data analysis and web development.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nThe companion files for this LiveLesson can be accessed from <a href=\"https://github.com/ariannedee/intro-to-python-livelessons\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/ariannedee/intro-to-python-livelessons</a>.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>Next Level Python</strong></em>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nPython was originally designed with learners in mind. It is also used by professional developers in a wide range of applications.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nIn this LiveLesson, you learn essential skills to move past a beginner level and become a proper Python developer. Such skills include using external libraries, managing project environments, handling exceptions, and making HTTP requests. By the end of the lessons, you will have created a web scraper in Python that gathers data from a website and outputs it into a CSV formatted file. Along the way, you will be introduced to key software construction concepts like testing, debugging, and refactoring.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nThe source code repository for this LiveLesson is kept at <a href=\"https://github.com/ariannedee/next-level-python-livelessons\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/ariannedee/next-level-python-livelessons</a>.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>About the Instructor</strong>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Arianne Dee</strong> is a freelance software developer and educator from the University of British Columbia and an instructor for Canada Learning Code and MakerLabs in Vancouver, BC.

    "title": "Advanced Python Development: Using Powerful Language Features in Real-World Applications",
    "description": "<span>This book builds on basic Python tutorials to explain various Python language features that aren’t routinely covered: from reusable console scripts that play double duty as micro-services by leveraging entry points, to using asyncio efficiently to collate data from a large number of sources. Along the way, it covers type-hint based linting, low-overhead testing and other automated quality checking to demonstrate a robust real-world development process.<div><br/></div><div>Some powerful aspects of Python are often documented with contrived examples that explain the feature as a standalone example only. By following the design and build of a real-world application example from prototype to production quality you'll see not only how the various pieces of functionality work but how they integrate as part of the larger system design process. In addition, you'll benefit from the kind of useful asides and library recommendations that are a staple of conference Q&amp;A sessions at Python conferences as well as discussions of modern Python best practice and techniques to better produce clear code that is easily maintainable.</div><div><br/></div><div><i>Advanced Python Development</i> is intended for developers who can already write simple programs in Python and want to understand when it’s appropriate to use new and advanced language features and to do so in a confident manner. It is especially of use to developers looking to progress to a more senior level and to very experienced developers who have thus far used older versions of Python.<br/></div><div><br/></div><div><div><b>What You'll Learn </b></div><div><ul><li>Understand asynchronous programming<br/></li><li>Examine developing plugin architectures<br/></li><li>Work with type annotations<br/></li><li>Review testing techniques<br/></li><li>Explore packaging and dependency management<br/></li></ul><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>Developers at the mid to senior level who already have Python experience.<br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></div></div><div><br/></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><p></p>Build a robust Python CLI tool with argparse<p>The <code>argparse</code> module is part of the Python standard library and meant to help you build robust command line tools. Once you need flags, switches, values, or positional arguments, it is very difficult to achieve that without using a framework.</p><p>In this case, <code>argparse</code> can help build all you need to handle inputs in the terminal. We'll see how a single file named <code>size.py</code> that calculates file sizes can make use of <code>argparse</code> to handle the input in the terminal. Then, we will cover how error handling is done automatically when the expectations from <code>argparse</code> aren't met. And finally, we'll go through some of the help menu options that construct the body of the help output.</p><p>Check the resources section for the GitHub repo with sample code</p>Why would you want to use argparse<p>Since <code>argparse</code> is part of the Python standard library, there is no need for you to define or install any external dependencies. You are ensuring that any Python installation in any system will work correctly out of the gate.\nA very basic Python CLI tool without dependencies using the argparse module</p>Next steps<p>Now that you know how to enhance a Python script into a more powerful one with <code>argparse</code>, you can try out other frameworks like the Click framework or something much simpler by using the <code>sys</code> module. I have examples and guides for the <a href=\"https://github.com/alfredodeza/basic-python-cli\">sys.argv module</a> and for <a href=\"https://github.com/alfredodeza/click-python-cli\">using the Click framework</a>.</p>Useful links and resources<ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/alfredodeza/argparse-python-cli\">GitHub repo with sample code</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/python-language/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza\">Build Python applications from scratch</a></li><li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/yyQM70vi7V8\">Setup your Data Science environment with VSCode</a></li></ul></span>",

It sports a very readable syntax, intuitive variable management, and a very large body of functionality that ranges from simple arithmetic to complex computing. </p><i>\n</i><p>Python for Experimental Psychologists provides researchers without prior programming experience with the knowledge they need to independently script experiments and analyses in Python. The skills it offers include: how to display stimuli on a computer screen; how to get input from peripherals (e.g. keyboard, mouse) and specialised equipment (e.g. eye trackers); how to log data; and how to control timing. In addition, it shows readers the basic principles of data analysis applied to behavioural data, and the more advanced techniques required to analyse trace data (e.g. pupil size) and gaze data.</p><p>Written informally and accessibly, the book deliberately focuses on the parts of Python that are relevant to experimental psychologists and cognitive neuroscientists. It is also supported by a companion website where you will find colour versions of the figures, along with example stimuli, datasets and scripts, and a portable Windows installation of Python.</p></span>",

It is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It is often used as a scripting language because of its forgiving syntax and compatibility with a wide variety of different eco-systems. Its flexible syntax enables developers to write short scripts while at the same time, they can use object-oriented concepts to develop very large projects.</p><p>Python GUI Programming Cookbook follows a task-based approach to help you create beautiful and very effective GUIs with the least amount of code necessary. This book uses the simplest programming style, using the fewest lines of code to create a GUI in Python, and then advances to using object-oriented programming in later chapters. If you are new to object-oriented programming (OOP), this book will teach you how to take advantage of the OOP coding style in the context of creating GUIs written in Python.</p><p>Throughout the book, you will develop an entire GUI application, building recipe upon recipe, connecting the GUI to a database. In the later chapters, you will explore additional Python GUI frameworks, using best practices. You will also learn how to use threading to ensure your GUI doesn't go unresponsive.</p><p>By the end of the book, you will be an expert in Python GUI programming to develop a common set of GUI applications.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>Every recipe in this programming cookbook solves a problem you might encounter in your programming career. At the same time, most of the recipes build on each other to create an entire, real-life GUI application.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>The equations used to describe dynamic properties of physical systems are often nonlinear, and it is rarely possible to find their solutions. Although numerical solutions are impractical and graphical techniques are not useful for many types of systems, there are different theorems and methods that are useful regarding qualitative properties of nonlinear systems and their solutions—system stability being the most crucial property. Without stability, a system will not have value.<br/><br/><strong>Nonlinear Systems Stability Analysis: Lyapunov-Based Approach</strong><b> </b>introduces advanced tools for stability analysis of nonlinear systems. It presents the most recent progress in stability analysis and provides a complete review of the dynamic systems stability analysis methods using Lyapunov approaches. The author discusses standard stability techniques, highlighting their shortcomings, and also describes recent developments in stability analysis that can improve applicability of the standard methods. The text covers mostly new topics such as stability of homogonous nonlinear systems and higher order Lyapunov functions derivatives for stability analysis. It also addresses special classes of nonlinear systems including time-delayed and fuzzy systems.<br/><br/>Presenting new methods, this book provides a nearly complete set of methods for constructing Lyapunov functions in both autonomous and nonautonomous systems, touching on new topics that open up novel research possibilities. Gathering a body of research into one volume, this text offers information to help engineers design stable systems using practice-oriented methods and can be used for graduate courses in a range of engineering disciplines.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>Portable, powerful, and a breeze to use, Python is the popular open source object-oriented programming language used for both standalone programs and scripting applications. Python is considered easy to learn, but there's no quicker way to mastery of the language than learning from an expert teacher. This edition of <i>Learning Python</i> puts you in the hands of two expert teachers, Mark Lutz and David Ascher, whose friendly, well-structured prose has guided many a programmer to proficiency with the language. <br/><br/><i>Learning Python</i>, Second Edition, offers programmers a comprehensive learning tool for Python and object-oriented programming. Thoroughly updated for the numerous language and class presentation changes that have taken place since the release of the first edition in 1999, this guide introduces the basic elements of the latest release of Python 2.3 and covers new features, such as list comprehensions, nested scopes, and iterators/generators. <br/><br/>Beyond language features, this edition of <i>Learning Python</i> also includes new context for less-experienced programmers, including fresh overviews of object-oriented programming and dynamic typing, new discussions of program launch and configuration options, new coverage of documentation sources, and more. There are also new use cases throughout to make the application of language features more concrete. <br/><br/>The first part of <i>Learning Python</i> gives programmers all the information they'll need to understand and construct programs in the Python language, including types, operators, statements, classes, functions, modules and exceptions. The authors then present more advanced material, showing how Python performs common tasks by offering real applications and the libraries available for those applications. Each chapter ends with a series of exercises that will test your Python skills and measure your understanding.<br/><br/><i>Learning Python</i>, Second Edition is a self-paced book that allows readers to focus on the core Python language in depth. As you work through the book, you'll gain a deep and complete understanding of the Python language that will help you to understand the larger application-level examples that you'll encounter on your own. If you're interested in learning Python--and want to do so quickly and efficiently--then <i>Learning Python</i>, Second Edition is your best choice.</p></span></span>",

We discuss some important terms such as servers, clients, requests, and responses. Moreover, you will learn about data connectivity, APIs, and endpoints. Then we continue by introducing the real-life example exercise the course is centred around: the Absenteeism at Work dataset. The preprocessing part that follows will give you a taste of what BI and data science look like in real-life, on-the-job situations. Then we continue by applying some Machine Learning to our data. You will learn how to explore the problem at hand from a machine-learning perspective, how to create targets, what kind of statistical preprocessing is necessary for this part of the exercise, how to train a Machine Learning model, and how to test it—a truly comprehensive ML exercise. Connecting Python and SQL is not immediate; we show how that's done in an entire section of the course.</p><p>By the end of that section, you will be able to transfer data from Jupyter to Workbench. And finally, as promised, Tableau will allow us to visualize the data we have been working with. We will prepare several insightful charts and will interpret the results together.</p></span>",

    "title": "Python for SAS Users: A SAS-Oriented Introduction to Python",
    "description": "<span><p>Business users familiar with Base SAS programming can now learn Python by example. You will learn via examples that map SAS programming constructs and coding patterns into their Python equivalents. Your primary focus will be on pandas and data management issues related to analysis of data.</p><p>It is estimated that there are three million or more SAS users worldwide today. As the data science landscape shifts from using SAS to open source software such as Python, many users will feel the need to update their skills. Most users are not formally trained in computer science and have likely acquired their skills programming SAS as part of their job.</p>\n\nAs a result, the current documentation and plethora of books and websites for learning Python are technical and not geared for most SAS users. <i><b>Python for SAS Users</b></i> provides the most comprehensive set of examples currently available. It contains over 200 Python scripts and approximately 75 SAS programs that are analogs to the Python scripts. The first chapters are more Python-centric, while the remaining chapters illustrate SAS and corresponding Python examples to solve common data analysis tasks such as reading multiple input sources, missing value detection, imputation, merging/combining data, and producing output. This book is an indispensable guide for integrating SAS and Python workflows.<p><b></b></p>\n<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What You’ll Learn</b></p>\n<p></p><ul><li>Quickly master Python for data analysis without using a trial-and-error approach<br/></li><li>Understand the similarities and differences between Base SAS and Python<br/></li><li>Better determine which language to use, depending on your needs<br/></li><li>Obtain quick results<br/></li></ul><p></p>\n<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b><br/></p>\n<p>SAS users, SAS programmers, data scientists, data scientist leaders, and Python users who need to work with SAS</p></span>",

In this course, you will learn the skills you need to be able to apply TDD in your .NET projects. Unit Testing is a type of software testing where code is written to automate the testing of sub-sections of an entire application. This methodology gives more functional coverage and reduces the need for manual regression testing when the application's code changes. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected.</p><p>We will also look at troubleshooting and debugging errors as we go along; implementing best practices; writing efficient logic and understanding why developers do things the way they do. Your knowledge will grow, step-by-step, throughout the course and you will be challenged to be the best you can be.</p><p>After this course, you will have foundational knowledge of test-driven development that will help you as you move forward to test and implement new features in your C# projects.

In fact, many claim that Go is superior to C++ in terms of its concurrency and ease of use. Most graphical application toolkits, though, are still written using C or C++, and so they don't enjoy the benefits of using a modern programming language such as Go. \n</p><p>This guide to programming GUIs with Go 1.11 explores the various toolkits available, including UI, Walk, Shiny, and Fyne. The book compares the vision behind each project to help you pick the right approach for your project. Each framework is described in detail, outlining how you can build performant applications that users will love. To aid you further in creating applications using these emerging technologies, you'll be able to easily refer to code samples and screenshots featured in the book. In addition to toolkit-specific discussions, you'll cover more complex topics, such as how to structure growing graphical applications, and how cross-platform applications can integrate with each desktop operating system to create a seamless user experience. By delving into techniques and best practices for organizing and scaling Go-based graphical applications, you'll also glimpse Go's impressive concurrency system. In the concluding chapters, you'll discover how to distribute to the main desktop marketplaces and distribution channels. \n</p><p>By the end of this book, you'll be a confident GUI developer who can use the Go language to boost the performance of your applications.\n</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Understand the benefits and complexities of building native graphical applications \n</li><li>Gain insights into how Go makes cross-platform graphical application development simple \n</li><li>Build platform-native GUI applications using andlabs/ui \n</li><li>Develop graphical Windows applications using Walk \n</li><li>Create multiplatform GUI applications using Shiny, Nuklear, and Fyne \n</li><li>Use Go wrappers for GTK and Qt for GUI application development  \n</li><li>Streamline your requirements to pick the correct toolkit strategy\n</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book is designed for Go developers who are interested in building native graphical applications for desktop computers and beyond. Some knowledge of building applications using Go is useful, but not essential. Experience in developing GUIs is not required as the book explores the benefits and challenges they pose. This book will also be beneficial for GUI application developers who are interested in trying Go.</p></span>",

Aimed at intermediate-level programmers, <i>Object-Oriented Python</i> is a hands-on tutorial that goes deep into the core tenets of OOP, showing you how to use encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance to write games and apps using Python.</p><p>The book begins by demonstrating key problems inherent in procedural programming, then guides you through the basics of creating classes and objects in Python. You’ll build on this groundwork by developing buttons, text fields, and other GUI elements that are standard in event-driven environments. You’ll also use many real-world code examples and two pygame-based packages to help turn theory into practice, enabling you to easily write interactive games and applications complete with GUI widgets, animations, multiple scenes, and reusable game logic. In the final chapter, you’ll bring it all together by building a fully functional video game that incorporates many of the OOP techniques and GUI elements covered in the book.</p><p>You’ll learn how to:</p><p>•Create and manage multiple objects using an object manager object<br/>•Use encapsulation to hide the inner details of objects from client code<br/>•Use polymorphism to define one interface and implement it in multiple classes<br/>•Apply inheritance to build on existing code</p><p><i>Object-Oriented Python</i> is a visual, intuitive guide to fully understanding how OOP operates and how you can use it to make your code more maintainable, readable, and efficient—without sacrificing functionality.</p></div></span>",

Software developers, architects, and technical management teams rely on high-level software design patterns such as microservices architecture, event-driven architecture, and the strategic patterns prescribed by domain-driven design (DDD) to make their work easier.</p><p>This book covers these proven architecture design patterns with a forward-looking approach to help Python developers manage application complexity—and get the most value out of their test suites.</p><p>Starting with the initial stages of design, you will learn about the main blocks and mental flow to use at the start of a project. The book covers various architectural patterns like microservices, web services, and event-driven structures and how to choose the one best suited to your project. Establishing a foundation of required concepts, you will progress into development, debugging, and testing to produce high-quality code that is ready for deployment. You will learn about ongoing operations on how to continue the task after the system is deployed to end users, as the software development lifecycle is never finished.</p><p>By the end of this Python book, you will have developed \"architectural thinking\": a different way of approaching software design, including making changes to ongoing systems.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Think like an architect, analyzing software architecture patterns</li><li>Explore API design, data storage, and data representation methods</li><li>Investigate the nuances of common architectural structures</li><li>Utilize and interoperate elements of patterns such as microservices</li><li>Implement test-driven development to perform quality code testing</li><li>Recognize chunks of code that can be restructured as packages</li><li>Maintain backward compatibility and deploy iterative changes</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book will help software developers and architects understand the structure of large complex systems and adopt architectural patterns that are scalable. Examples in the book are implemented in Python so a fair grasp of basic Python concepts is expected. Proficiency in any programming languages such as Java or JavaScript is sufficient.</p></span>",

Rust, on the other hand, provides memory safety without using a garbage collector, which means that with its low memory footprint, you can build high-performant and secure apps relatively easily. However, rewriting everything in Rust can be expensive and risky as there might not be package support in Rust for the problem being solved. This is where Python bindings and pip come in.</p><p>This book will help you, as a Python developer, to start using Rust in your Python projects without having to manage a separate Rust server or application. Seeing as you'll already understand concepts like functions and loops, this book covers the quirks of Rust such as memory management to code Rust in a productive and structured manner. You'll explore the PyO3 crate to fuse Rust code with Python, learn how to package your fused Rust code in a pip package, and then deploy a Python Flask application in Docker that uses a private Rust pip module. Finally, you'll get to grips with advanced Rust binding topics such as inspecting Python objects and modules in Rust.</p><p>By the end of this Rust book, you'll be able to develop safe and high-performant applications with better concurrency support.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Explore the quirks of the Rust programming language that a Python developer needs to understand to code in Rust</li><li>Understand the trade-offs for multiprocessing and thread safety to write concurrent code</li><li>Build and manage a software project with cargo and crates</li><li>Fuse Rust code with Python so that Python can import and run Rust code</li><li>Deploy a Python Flask application in Docker that utilizes a private Rust pip module</li><li>Inspect and create your own Python objects in Rust</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book is for Python developers who want to speed up their Python code with Rust and implement Rust in a Python system without altering the entire system.

Use this book as your guide to help you hone your skills and sculpt a Python project that can stand the test of time.</p><p>No matter your experience level or background, Python's batteries-included standard library and rich third-party ecosystem provide a solid foundation to build your projects on. With the right intuition and background knowledge, you can take advantage of all the power Python offers. Take a guided tour of some of Python's high points to craft a project that you can sustain and build on for a long time.</p><p>Run static analysis tools to detect and eliminate classes of bugs before you run code. Experiment with Python's concurrency model and develop patterns for using Python's thread and process abstractions to their full potential. Introduce yourself to Python's type hinting system: mypy. Download and run third-party Python packages and do so safely without compromising on security. Debug code using Python's built in debugger, and try procedures out in the interactive console. Run your code under new versions of the Python interpreter to unlock performance and usability improvements. All along the way, sharpen your Python instincts so you can keep your code clean and reduce the chance of bugs.</p><p>Mine Python for all you can by playing to its strengths and embracing patterns that harness its potential.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>The books assumes you have some experience programming in any language (not necessarily Python). To run the code presented in the book, you'll need a Python environment which you can download from <a href=\"https://www.python.org/downloads/\">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a>.</p></div></span>",
