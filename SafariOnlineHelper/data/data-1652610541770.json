    "description": "<span><div><p>Data is at the center of many challenges in system design today. Difficult issues need to be figured out, such as scalability, consistency, reliability, efficiency, and maintainability. In addition, we have an overwhelming variety of tools, including relational databases, NoSQL datastores, stream or batch processors, and message brokers. What are the right choices for your application? How do you make sense of all these buzzwords?</p><p>In this practical and comprehensive guide, author Martin Kleppmann helps you navigate this diverse landscape by examining the pros and cons of various technologies for processing and storing data. Software keeps changing, but the fundamental principles remain the same. With this book, software engineers and architects will learn how to apply those ideas in practice, and how to make full use of data in modern applications.</p><ul><li>Peer under the hood of the systems you already use, and learn how to use and operate them more effectively</li><li>Make informed decisions by identifying the strengths and weaknesses of different tools</li><li>Navigate the trade-offs around consistency, scalability, fault tolerance, and complexity</li><li>Understand the distributed systems research upon which modern databases are built</li><li>Peek behind the scenes of major online services, and learn from their architectures</li></ul></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>Enormous quantities of data go unused or underused today, simply because people can't visualize the quantities and relationships in it. Using a downloadable programming environment developed by the author, <em>Visualizing Data</em> demonstrates methods for representing data accurately on the Web and elsewhere, complete with user interaction, animation, and more.<br/><br/>How do the 3.1 billion A, C, G and T letters of the human genome compare to those of a chimp or a mouse? What do the paths that millions of visitors take through a web site look like? With <em>Visualizing Data</em>, you learn how to answer complex questions like these with thoroughly interactive displays. We're not talking about cookie-cutter charts and graphs. This book teaches you how to design entire interfaces around large, complex data sets with the help of a powerful new design and prototyping tool called \"Processing\".<br/><br/>Used by many researchers and companies to convey specific data in a clear and understandable manner, the Processing beta is available free. With this tool and <em>Visualizing Data</em> as a guide, you'll learn basic visualization principles, how to choose the right kind of display for your purposes, and how to provide interactive features that will bring users to your site over and over. This book teaches you:</p><ul><li>The seven stages of visualizing data -- acquire, parse, filter, mine, represent, refine, and interact</li><li>How all data problems begin with a question and end with a narrative construct that provides a clear answer without extraneous details</li><li>Several example projects with the code to make them work</li><li>Positive and negative points of each representation discussed. The focus is on customization so that each one best suits what you want to convey about your data set</li></ul>The book does not provide ready-made \"visualizations\" that can be plugged into any data set. Instead, with chapters divided by types of data rather than types of display, you'll learn how each visualization conveys the unique properties of the data it represents -- why the data was collected, what's interesting about it, and what stories it can tell. <em>Visualizing Data</em> teaches you how to answer questions, not simply display information.</div></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p><strong>20 Hours of Video Instruction</strong><br/><br/><strong>Data Science Fundamentals LiveLessons</strong> teaches you the foundational concepts, theory, and techniques you need to know to become an effective data scientist. The videos present you with applied, example-driven lessons in Python and its associated ecosystem of libraries, where you get your hands dirty with real datasets and see real results.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Description</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nIf nothing else, by the end of this video course you will have analyzed a number of datasets from the wild, built a handful of applications, and applied machine learning algorithms in meaningful ways to get real results. And along the way you learn the best practices and computational techniques used by a professional data scientist. More specifically, you learn how to acquire data that is openly accessible on the Internet by working with APIs. You learn how to parse XML and JSON data to load it into a relational database. </p><p>About the Instructor</p><p><strong>Jonathan Dinu</strong> is an author, researcher, and most importantly, an educator. He is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon's Human Computer Interaction Institute (HCII), where he is working to democratize machine learning and artificial intelligence through interpretable and interactive algorithms. Previously, he founded Zipfian Academy (an immersive data science training program acquired by Galvanize), has taught classes at the University of San Francisco, and has built a Data Visualization MOOC with Udacity. In addition to his professional data science experience, he has run data science trainings for a Fortune 500 company and taught workshops at Strata, PyData, and DataWeek (among others). He first discovered his love of all things data while studying Computer Science and Physics at UC Berkeley, and in a former life he worked for Alpine Data Labs developing distributed machine learning algorithms for predictive analytics on Hadoop.<br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan has always had a passion for sharing the things he has learned in the most creative ways he can. When he is not working with students, you can find him blogging about data, visualization, and education at <a href=\"http://hepm.pearsoned.com/hopelessoptimism.com\" target=\"\" title=\"\">hopelessoptimism.com</a> or rambling on Twitter @jonathandinu.</p><p><strong>Skill Level</strong></p><ul><li>Beginner</li></ul><strong>What You Will Learn</strong><br/><ul><li>How to get up and running with a Python data science environment</li><li>The essentials of Python 3, including object-oriented programming</li><li>The basics of the data science process and what each step entails</li><li>How to build a simple (yet powerful) recommendation engine for Airbnb listings</li><li>Where to find quality data sources and how to work with APIs programmatically</li><li>Strategies for parsing JSON and XML into a structured form</li><li>The basics of relational databases and how to use an ORM to interface with them in Python</li><li>Best practices of data validation, including common data quality checks</li></ul><strong>Who Should Take This Course</strong><br/><ul><li>Aspiring data scientists looking to break into the field and learn the essentials necessary</li><li>Journalists, consultants, analysts, or anyone else who works with data and looking to take a programmatic approach to exploring data and conducting analyses</li><li>Quantitative researchers interested in applying theory to real projects and taking a computational approach to modeling.</li><li>Software engineers interested in building intelligent applications driven by machine learning</li><li>Practicing data scientists already familiar with another programming environment looking to learn how to do data science with Python</li></ul><strong>Course Requirements</strong><br/><ul><li>Basic understanding of programming</li><li>Familiarity with Python and statistics are a plus</li></ul><strong>Lesson Descriptions</strong><br/><br/><strong>Lesson 1: Introduction to Data Science with Python</strong><br/><br/>\nLesson 1 begins with a working definition of data science (as we use it in the course), gives a brief history of the field, and provides motivating examples of data science products and applications. This lesson covers how to get set up with a data science programming environment locally, as well as gives you a crash course in the Python programming language if you are unfamiliar with it or are coming from another language such as R. Finally, it ends with an overview of the concepts and tools that the rest of the lessons cover to hopefully motivate you for and excite you about what's to come!<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 2: The Data Science Process—Building Your First Application</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nLesson 2 introduces the data science process by walking through an end-to-end example of building your very first data science application, an AirBnB listing recommender.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou continue to learn how to work with and manipulate data in Python, without any external libraries yet, and leverage the power of the built-in Python standard library. The core application of this lesson covers the basics of building a recommendation engine and shows you how, with simple statistics and a little ingenuity, you can build a compelling recommender, given the right data. And finally, it ends with a formal treatment of the data science process and the individual steps it entails.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 3: Acquiring Data—Sources and Methods</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nLesson 3 begins the treatment of each of the specific stages of the data science process, starting with the first: data acquisition. The lesson covers the basics of finding the appropriate data source for your problem and how to download the datasets you need once you have found them.<br/>\n<br/>\nStarting with an overview of how the infrastructure behind the Internet works, you learn how to programmatically make HTTP requests in Python to access data through APIs, as well as the basics of two of the most common data formats: JSON and XML. The lesson ends by setting up the dataset we use for the rest of the course: Foursquare Venues.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorking with the Foursquare dataset, you learn how to interact with APIs and do some minor web scraping. You also learn how to find and acquire data from a variety of sources and keep track of its lineage all along the way. You learn to put yourself in the data science mindset and how to see the data (hidden in plain sight) that we interact with every day.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 4: Adding Structure—Data Parsing and Storage</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nLesson 4 picks up with the second stage of what traditionally is referred to as an extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipeline, adding structure through the transformation of raw data.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou see how to work with a variety of data formats, including XML and JSON, by parsing the data we have acquired to eventually load it into an environment better-suited to exploration and analysis: a relational database. But before we load our data into a database, we take a short diversion to talk about how to conceptually model structure in data with code. You get a primer in object-oriented programming and learn how to leverage it to create abstractions and data models that define how you can interface with your data.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 5: Storing Data: Relational Databases (with SQLite)</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nLesson 5 starts with an introduction to one of the most ubiquitous data technologies—the relational database. The lesson serves as an end cap to the ETL pipeline of the previous videos. You learn the ins and outs of the various strategies for storing data and see how to map the abstractions you created in Python to database tables through the use of an object-relational mapper (ORM). By being able to query and manipulate data with Python while persisting data in a database reliably, the interface ORMs provide gives you the best of both worlds.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 6: Data Validation and Exploration<br/>\n</strong><br/>\nLesson 6 starts by showing you how to effectively query your data to understand what it contains, uncover any biases it might contain, and learn the best practices of dealing with missing values. After you have validated the quality of the data, you use descriptive statistics to learn how your data is distributed as well as learn the limits of point statistics (or rather single number estimates) and why it is often necessary to use visual techniques.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>About LiveLessons Video Training</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nThe LiveLessons Video Training series publishes hundreds of hands-on, expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

Data scientists can make use of it in deriving meaningful insights that can be used by businesses to redefine or transform the way they operate. Lambda architecture is also emerging as one of the very eminent patterns in the big data landscape, as it not only helps to derive useful information from historical data but also correlates real-time data to enable business to take critical decisions. This book tries to bring these two important aspects — data lake and lambda architecture—together.</p><p>This book is divided into three main sections. The first introduces you to the concept of data lakes, the importance of data lakes in enterprises, and getting you up-to-speed with the Lambda architecture. The second section delves into the principal components of building a data lake using the Lambda architecture. It introduces you to popular big data technologies such as Apache Hadoop, Spark, Sqoop, Flume, and ElasticSearch. The third section is a highly practical demonstration of putting it all together, and shows you how an enterprise data lake can be implemented, along with several real-world use-cases. It also shows you how other peripheral components can be added to the lake to make it more efficient.</p><p>By the end of this book, you will be able to choose the right big data technologies using the lambda architectural patterns to build your enterprise data lake.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>The book takes a pragmatic approach, showing ways to leverage big data technologies and lambda architecture to build an enterprise-level data lake.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book.

    "description": "<span><p>The<i> </i>Data Vault was invented by Dan Linstedt at the U.S. Department of Defense, and the standard has been successfully applied to data warehousing projects at organizations of different sizes, from small to large-size corporations. Due to its simplified design, which is adapted from nature, the Data Vault 2.0 standard helps prevent typical data warehousing failures. </p><p>\"<i>Building a Scalable Data Warehouse</i>\" covers everything one needs to know to create a scalable data warehouse end to end, including a presentation of the Data Vault modeling technique, which provides the foundations to create a technical data warehouse layer. The book discusses how to build the data warehouse incrementally using the agile Data Vault 2.0 methodology. In addition, readers will learn how to create the input layer (the stage layer) and the presentation layer (data mart) of the Data Vault 2.0 architecture including implementation best practices. Drawing upon years of practical experience and using numerous examples and an easy to understand framework, Dan Linstedt and Michael Olschimke discuss:</p><ul><p> </p><li>How to load each layer using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), including automation of the Data Vault loading processes.</li><p> </p><li>Important data warehouse technologies and practices.</li><p> </p><li>Data Quality Services (DQS) and Master Data Services (MDS) in the context of the Data Vault architecture.</li></ul><ul><li>Provides a complete introduction to data warehousing, applications, and the business context so readers can get-up and running fast </li><li>Explains theoretical concepts and provides hands-on instruction on how to build and implement a data warehouse</li><li>Demystifies data vault modeling with beginning, intermediate, and advanced techniques</li><li>Discusses the advantages of the data vault approach over other techniques, also including the latest updates to Data Vault 2.0 and multiple improvements to Data Vault 1.0</li></ul></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p><b>Data Science</b> gets thrown around in the press like it's magic. Major retailers are predicting everything from when their customers are pregnant to when they want a new pair of Chuck Taylors. It's a brave new world where seemingly meaningless data can be transformed into valuable insight to drive smart business decisions.</p><p>But how does one exactly do data science? Do you have to hire one of these priests of the dark arts, the \"data scientist,\" to extract this gold from your data? Nope.</p><p>Data science is little more than using straight-forward steps to process raw data into actionable insight. And in <em>Data Smart</em>, author and data scientist John Foreman will show you how that's done within the familiar environment of a spreadsheet.</p><p>Why a spreadsheet? It's comfortable! You get to look at the data every step of the way, building confidence as you learn the tricks of the trade. Plus, spreadsheets are a vendor-neutral place to learn data science without the hype.</p><p>But don't let the Excel sheets fool you. This is a book for those serious about learning the analytic techniques, the math and the magic, behind big data.</p><p>Each chapter will cover a different technique in a spreadsheet so you can follow along:</p><ul><li><p>Mathematical optimization, including non-linear programming and genetic algorithms</p></li><li><p>Clustering via k-means, spherical k-means, and graph modularity</p></li><li><p>Data mining in graphs, such as outlier detection</p></li><li><p>Supervised AI through logistic regression, ensemble models, and bag-of-words models</p></li><li><p>Forecasting, seasonal adjustments, and prediction intervals through monte carlo simulation</p></li><li><p>Moving from spreadsheets into the R programming language</p></li></ul><p>You get your hands dirty as you work alongside John through each technique. But never fear, the topics are readily applicable and the author laces humor throughout. You'll even learn what a dead squirrel has to do with optimization modeling, which you no doubt are dying to know.</p></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><div><p>Kotlin is a JVM platform language that fills two practical data science needs: you can use it to prototype models quickly, then effectively move those models into production. Data science values languages that provide a fast turnaround. This is why R and Python are the usual language choices for the data science domain. However, as data science continues to integrate into mainstream software development workflows, a gap has appeared. It's one thing to hack together a proof-of-concept model; it's another to move it into the “business is evolving and models must be refactored” world of production. Kotlin closes the gap. Backed by Jetbrains and Google, Kotlin expands on the simplicity, conciseness, and elegance of Python, but carries the power, robustness, and scalability of Java and Scala. In this course, you'll get a detailed overview of Kotlin and discover why it's becoming the go-to practical language of choice for production-oriented data scientists and engineers. Learners should have Intellij IDEA and JDK, Python experience, and a little experience with basic analytics (Pandas, R, Excel, SQL, etc.).</p><ul><li>Learn about Kotlin, the emerging language of choice for data science and analytics</li><li>Understand the data science software-engineering gap and see how Kotlin can close it</li><li>Discover how well Kotlin moves models from proof-of-concept to production</li><li>Master the distinctions among Kotlin, Scala, and Python; then see why data engineers choose Kotlin</li><li>Learn how to utilize Kotlin’s tooling and environment with Intellij IDEA</li><li>Discover how Kotlin’s innovative nullable type system avoids null-related runtime errors</li><li>Explore how static typing and object-oriented programming make clear, bug resistant models</li><li>Gain experience using Kotlin for data science purposes like functions and data classes</li></ul><p>Thomas Nield is a senior-level business analyst for Southwest Airlines where he's developed multiple  reactive applications that generate revenue for the entire airline network.

    "description": "<span><span><p>This third volume of the best-selling \"Data Model Resource Book\" series revolutionizes the data modeling discipline by answering the question \"How can you save significant time while improving the quality of any type of data modeling effort?\" In contrast to the first two volumes, this new volume focuses on the fundamental, underlying patterns that affect over 50 percent of most data modeling efforts. These patterns can be used to considerably reduce modeling time and cost, to jump-start data modeling efforts, as standards and guidelines to increase data model consistency and quality, and as an objective source against which an enterprise can evaluate data models.<br/><strong>Praise for <em>The Data Model Resource Book, Volume 3</em></strong></p><p>\"Len and Paul look beneath the superficial issues of data modeling and have produced a work that is a must for every serious designer and manager of an IT project.\"<br/></p><p>\"<em>The Data Model Resource Book, Volume 3: Universal Patterns for Data Modeling</em> is a great source for reusable patterns you can use to save a tremendous amount of time, effort, and cost on any data modeling effort. Len Silverston and Paul Agnewhave provided an indispensable reference of very high-quality patterns for the most foundational types of datamodel structures. This book represents a revolutionary leap in moving the data modeling profession forward.\"<br/>—<strong>Ron Powell</strong>, Cofounder and Editorial Director of the Business Intelligence Network</p><p>\"After we model a Customer, Product, or Order, there is still more about each of these that remains to be captured, such as roles they play, classifications in which they belong, or states in which they change. <em>The Data Model Resource Book, Volume 3: Universal Patterns for Data Modeling</em> clearly illustrates these common structures. Len Silverston and Paul Agnew have created a valuable addition to our field, allowing us to improve the consistency and quality of our models by leveraging the many common structures within this text.\"<br/>—<strong>Steve Hoberman</strong>, Best-Selling Author of <em>Data Modeling Made Simple</em></p><p>\"The large national health insurance company I work at has actively used these data patterns and the (Universal Data Models) UDM, ahead of this book, through Len Silverston’s UDM Jump Start engagement. The patterns have found their way into the core of our Enterprise Information Model, our data warehouse designs, and progressively into key business function databases. We are getting to reuse the patterns across projects and are reaping benefits in understanding, flexibility, and time-to-market. Thanks so much.\"<br/>—<strong>David Chasteen</strong>, Enterprise Information Architect</p><p>\"Reusing proven data modeling design patterns means exactly that. Data models become stable, but remain very flexible to accommodate changes. We have had the fortune of having Len and Paul share the patterns that are described in this book via our engagements with Universal Data Models, LLC. These data modeling design patterns have helped us to focus on the essential business issues because we have leveraged these reusable building blocks for many of the standard design problems. These design patterns have also helped us to evaluate the quality of data models for their intended purpose. Many times there are a lot of enhancements required. Too often the very specialized business-oriented data model is also implemented physically. This may have significant drawbacks to flexibility. I’m looking forward to increasing the data modeling design pattern competence within Nokia with the help of this book.\"<br/>—<strong>Teemu Mattelmaki</strong>, Chief Information Architect, Nokia</p><p>\"Once again, Len Silverston, this time together with Paul Agnew, has made a valuable contribution to the body of knowledge about datamodels, and the act of building sound data models. As a professional data modeler, and teacher of data modeling for almost three decades, I have always been aware that I had developed some familiar mental \"patterns\" which I acquired very early in my data modeling experience. When teaching data modeling, we use relatively simple workshops, but they are carefully designed so the students will see and acquire a lot of these basic \"patterns\" — templates that they will recognize and can use to interpret different subject matter into data model form quickly and easily. I’ve always used these patterns in the course of facilitating data modeling sessions; I was able to recognize \"Ah, this is just like . . .,\" and quickly apply a pattern that I’d seen before. But, in all this time, I’ve never sat down and clearly categorized and documented what each of these “patterns’’ actually was in such a way that they could be easily and clearly communicated to others; Len and Paul have done exactly that. As in the other Data Model Resource Books, the thinking and writing is extraordinarily clear and understandable. I personally would have been very proud to have authored this book, and I sincerely applaud Len and Paul for another great contribution to the art and science of data modeling. It will be of great value to any data modeler.\"<br/>—<strong>William G. Smith</strong>, President, William G. Smith &amp; Associates, <code>www.williamgsmith.com</code></p><p>\"Len Silverston and Paul Agnew’s book, Universal Patterns for Data Modeling, is essential reading for anyone undertaking commercial datamodeling. With this latest volume that compiles and insightfully describes fundamental, universal data patterns, The Data Model Resource Book series represents the most important contribution to the data modeling discipline in the last decade.\"<br/>—<strong>Dr. Graeme Simsion</strong>, Author of <em>Data Modeling Essentials</em> and <em>Data Modeling Theory and Practice</em></p><p>\"Volume 3 of this trilogy is a most welcome addition to Len Silverston’s two previous books in this area. Guidance has existed for some time for those who desire to use pattern-based analysis to jump-start their data modeling efforts. Guidance exists for those who want to use generalized and industry-specific data constructs to leverage their efforts. What has been missing is guidance to those of us needing guidance to complete the roughly one-third of data models that are not generalized or industry-specific. This is where the magic of individual organizational strategies must manifest itself, and Len and Paul have done so clearly and articulately in a manner that complements the first two volumes of <em>The Data Model Resource Book</em>. By adding this book to Volumes 1 and 2 you will be gaining access to some of the most integrated data modeling guidance available on the planet.\"<br/>—<strong>Dr. Peter Aiken</strong>, Author of <em>XML in Data Management</em> and data management industry leader VCU/Data Blueprint</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p/><p>This book highlights the different types of data architecture and illustrates the many possibilities hidden behind the term \"Big Data\", from the usage of No-SQL databases to the deployment of stream analytics architecture, machine learning, and governance.</p><p><em>Scalable Big Data Architecture</em> covers real-world, concrete industry use cases that leverage complex distributed applications , which involve web applications, RESTful API, and high throughput of large amount of data stored in highly scalable No-SQL data stores such as Couchbase and Elasticsearch. This book demonstrates how data processing can be done at scale from the usage of NoSQL datastores to the combination of Big Data distribution.</p><p>When the data processing is too complex and involves different processing topology like long running jobs, stream processing, multiple data sources correlation, and machine learning, it’s often necessary to delegate the load to Hadoop or Spark and use the No-SQL to serve processed data in real time.</p><p>This book shows you how to choose a relevant combination of big data technologies available within the Hadoop ecosystem. It focuses on processing long jobs, architecture, stream data patterns, log analysis, and real time analytics. Every pattern is illustrated with practical examples, which use the different open sourceprojects such as Logstash, Spark, Kafka, and so on. </p><p>Traditional data infrastructures are built for digesting and rendering data synthesis and analytics from large amount of data. This book helps you to understand why you should consider using machine learning algorithms early on in the project, before being overwhelmed by constraints imposed by dealing with the high throughput of Big data.</p><p><em>Scalable Big Data Architecture</em> is for developers, data architects, and data scientists looking for a better understanding of how to choose the most relevant pattern for a Big Data project and which tools to integrate into that pattern.</p></span></span>",

    "title": "Understanding Data Governance",
    "description": "<span><div><p>From the moment your organization starts collecting data, it’s crucial to make key decisions about governance. What data should you gather? How do you ensure it’s accurate and current? Where do you store it, and for how long? Today, many policies for gathering and sharing data are determined in business suites, rather than by the nature of the data itself. In order to meet strategic business requirements, you must understand and define the rules that manage your organization’s data assets.</p><p>In this report, you’ll examine the many aspects of data-driven governance, particularly how this approach makes automation, enforcement, and security tasks easier. Author Federico Castanedo of Vodafone Group describes the practices and frameworks for regulatory compliance, including technology that can marry your policies to data you collect and provide fine-grained access controls.</p><p>Many businesses collect large volumes of structured, unstructured, geospatial, and other data types that often require NoSQL databases alongside relational platforms. This detailed report explores how multi-model databases support a wide range of data models against a single integrated backend, enabling your organization to easily define data-driven governance policies at scale—and ultimately to help you reduce compliance costs.</p><p>Discover a new approach that establishes governance at the data level versus the system level in order to reduce risk, facilitate operational decisions, and improve integrity.</p></div></span>",

    "title": "Measuring Data Quality for Ongoing Improvement",
    "description": "<span><p><i>The Data Quality Assessment Framework</i> shows you how to measure and monitor data quality, ensuring quality over time. You’ll start with general concepts of measurement and work your way through a detailed framework of more than three dozen measurement types related to five objective dimensions of quality: completeness, timeliness, consistency, validity, and integrity. Ongoing measurement, rather than one time activities will help your organization reach a new level of data quality. This plain-language approach to measuring data can be understood by both business and IT and provides practical guidance on how to apply the DQAF within any organization enabling you to prioritize measurements and effectively report on results. Strategies for using data measurement to govern and improve the quality of data and guidelines for applying the framework within a data asset are included. You’ll come away able to prioritize which measurement types to implement, knowing where to place them in a data flow and how frequently to measure. Common conceptual models for defining and storing of data quality results for purposes of trend analysis are also included as well as generic business requirements for ongoing measuring and monitoring including calculations and comparisons that make the measurements meaningful and help understand trends and detect anomalies. </p><ul><li>Demonstrates how to leverage a technology independent data quality measurement framework for your specific business priorities and data quality challenges</li><li>Enables discussions between business and IT with a non-technical vocabulary for data quality measurement</li><li>Describes how to measure data quality on an ongoing basis with generic measurement types that can be applied to any situation</li></ul></span>",

    "title": "From Data Science to Production with Kotlin: The Basics",
    "description": "<span><span><div><p>Kotlin is a JVM platform language that fills two practical data science needs: you can use it to prototype models quickly, then effectively move those models into production. Data science values languages that provide a fast turnaround. This is why R and Python are the usual language choices for the data science domain. However, as data science continues to integrate into mainstream software development workflows, a gap has appeared. It's one thing to hack together a proof-of-concept model; it's another to move it into the “business is evolving and models must be refactored” world of production. Kotlin closes the gap. Backed by Jetbrains and Google, Kotlin expands on the simplicity, conciseness, and elegance of Python, but carries the power, robustness, and scalability of Java and Scala. In this course, you'll get a detailed overview of Kotlin and discover why it's becoming the go-to practical language of choice for production-oriented data scientists and engineers. Learners should have Intellij IDEA and JDK, Python experience, and a little experience with basic analytics (Pandas, R, Excel, SQL, etc.).</p><ul><li>Learn about Kotlin, the emerging language of choice for data science and analytics</li><li>Understand the data science software-engineering gap and see how Kotlin can close it</li><li>Discover how well Kotlin moves models from proof-of-concept to production</li><li>Master the distinctions among Kotlin, Scala, and Python; then see why data engineers choose Kotlin</li><li>Learn how to utilize Kotlin’s tooling and environment with Intellij IDEA</li><li>Discover how Kotlin’s innovative nullable type system avoids null-related runtime errors</li><li>Explore how static typing and object-oriented programming make clear, bug resistant models</li><li>Gain experience using Kotlin for data science purposes like functions and data classes</li></ul><p>Thomas Nield is a senior-level business analyst for Southwest Airlines where he's developed multiple  reactive applications that generate revenue for the entire airline network. A master programmer working in Java, Kotlin, ReactiveX, Python, and database design, Thomas writes a popular blog covering ReactiveX concepts, maintains RxJavaFX and RxKotlinFX, and is the author of the O'Reilly title <i>Getting Started with SQL</i>.</p></div></span></span>",

Everything’s software and\nplatform agnostic, so you can learn data science whether you work\nwith R, Stata, SPSS, or SAS. Best of all, Haider teaches a crucial\nskillset most data science books ignore: how to tell powerful\nstories using graphics and tables. Every chapter is built around\nreal research challenges, so you’ll always know why\nyou’re doing what you’re doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou’ll master data science by answering fascinating\nquestions, such as:<br/>\n• Are religious individuals more or less likely to have\nextramarital affairs?<br/>\n• Do attractive professors get better teaching\nevaluations?<br/>\n• Does the higher price of cigarettes deter smoking?<br/>\n• What determines housing prices more: lot size or the number\nof bedrooms?<br/>\n• How do teenagers and older people differ in the way they\nuse social media?<br/>\n• Who is more likely to use online dating services?<br/>\n• Why do some purchase iPhones and others Blackberry\ndevices?<br/>\n• Does the presence of children influence a family’s\nspending on alcohol?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor each problem, you’ll walk through defining your question\nand the answers you’ll need; exploring how<br/>\nothers have approached similar challenges; selecting your data and\nmethods; generating your statistics;<br/>\norganizing your report; and telling your story. Throughout, the\nfocus is squarely on what matters most:<br/>\ntransforming data into insights that are clear, accurate, and can\nbe acted upon.<br/>\n<br/></p></span></span>",

Fortunately, scale and simplicity are not mutually exclusive.</p><p><i>Big Data</i> teaches you to build big data systems using an architecture designed specifically to capture and analyze web-scale data. This book presents the Lambda Architecture, a scalable, easy-to-understand approach that can be built and run by a small team. You'll explore the theory of big data systems and how to implement them in practice. In addition to discovering a general framework for processing big data, you'll learn specific technologies like Hadoop, Storm, and NoSQL databases.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><span><span><span><p><b>A comprehensive overview of data science covering the analytics, programming, and business skills necessary to master the discipline</b></p><p>Finding a good data scientist has been likened to hunting for a unicorn: the required combination of technical skills is simply very hard to find in one person. In addition, good data science is not just rote application of trainable skill sets; it requires the ability to think flexibly about all these areas and understand the connections between them. This book provides a crash course in data science, combining all the necessary skills into a unified discipline.</p><p>Unlike many analytics books, computer science and software engineering are given extensive coverage since they play such a central role in the daily work of a data scientist. The author also describes classic machine learning algorithms, from their mathematical foundations to real-world applications. Visualization tools are reviewed, and their central importance in data science is highlighted. Classical statistics is addressed to help readers think critically about the interpretation of data and its common pitfalls. The clear communication of technical results, which is perhaps the most undertrained of data science skills, is given its own chapter, and all topics are explained in the context of solving real-world data problems. The book also features:</p><p>• Extensive sample code and tutorials using Python™ along with its technical libraries</p><p>• Core technologies of “Big Data,” including their strengths and limitations and how they can be used to solve real-world problems</p><p>• Coverage of the practical realities of the tools, keeping theory to a minimum; however, when theory is presented, it is done in an intuitive way to encourage critical thinking and creativity</p><p>• A wide variety of case studies from industry</p><p>• Practical advice on the realities of being a data scientist today, including the overall workflow, where time is spent, the types of datasets worked on, and the skill sets needed</p><p><i>The Data Science Handbook </i>is an ideal resource for data analysis methodology and big data software tools. The book is appropriate for people who want to practice data science, but lack the required skill sets. This includes software professionals who need to better understand analytics and statisticians who need to understand software. Modern data science is a unified discipline, and it is presented as such. This book is also an appropriate reference for researchers and entry-level graduate students who need to learn real-world analytics and expand their skill set.</p><p><b>FIELD CADY </b>is the data scientist at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, where he develops tools that use machine learning to mine scientific literature. He has also worked at Google and several Big Data startups. He has a BS in physics and math from Stanford University, and an MS in computer science from Carnegie Mellon.</p></span></span></span></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p><b>Create a competitive advantage with data quality</b></p><p>Data is rapidly becoming the powerhouse of industry, but low-quality data can actually put a company at a disadvantage. To be used effectively, data must accurately reflect the real-world scenario it represents, and it must be in a form that is usable and accessible. Quality data involves asking the right questions, targeting the correct parameters, and having an effective internal management, organization, and access system. It must be relevant, complete, and correct, while falling in line with pervasive regulatory oversight programs.</p><p><em>Competing with High Quality Data: Concepts, Tools and Techniques for Building a Successful Approach to Data Quality</em> takes a holistic approach to improving data quality, from collection to usage. Author Rajesh Jugulum is globally-recognized as a major voice in the data quality arena, with high-level backgrounds in international corporate finance. In the book, Jugulum provides a roadmap to data quality innovation, covering topics such as:</p><li><p>The four-phase approach to data quality control</p></li><li><p>Methodology that produces data sets for different aspects of a business</p></li><li><p>Streamlined data quality assessment and issue resolution</p></li><li><p>A structured, systematic, disciplined approach to effective data gathering</p></li><p>The book also contains real-world case studies to illustrate how companies across a broad range of sectors have employed data quality systems, whether or not they succeeded, and what lessons were learned. High-quality data increases value throughout the information supply chain, and the benefits extend to the client, employee, and shareholder. <em>Competing with High Quality Data: Concepts, Tools and Techniques for Building a Successful Approach to Data Quality</em> provides the information and guidance necessary to formulate and activate an effective data quality plan today.</p></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Advanced data management has always been at the core of efficient database and information systems. Recent trends like big data and cloud computing have aggravated the need for sophisticated and flexible data storage and processing solutions.<br/>This book provides a comprehensive coverage of the principles of data management developed in the last decades with a focus on data structures and query languages. It treats a wealth of different data models and surveys the foundations of structuring, processing, storing and querying data according these models.</p><p>Starting off with the topic of database design, it further discusses weaknesses of the relational data model, and then proceeds to convey the basics of graph data, tree-structured XML data, key-value pairs and nested, semi-structured JSON data, columnar and record-oriented data as well as object-oriented data. The final chapters round the book off with an analysis of fragmentation, replication and consistency strategies for data management in distributed databases as well as recommendations for handling polyglot persistence in multi-model databases and multi-database architectures.</p><p>While primarily geared towards students of Master-level courses in Computer Science and related areas, this book may also be of benefit to practitioners looking for a reference book on data modeling and query processing. It provides both theoretical depth and a concise treatment of open source technologies currently on the market.<br/></p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Published in 1996, Richard Jones’s <em>Garbage Collection</em> was a milestone in the area of automatic memory management. The field has grown considerably since then, sparking a need for an updated look at the latest state-of-the-art developments. <strong>The Garbage Collection Handbook: The Art of Automatic Memory Management</strong> brings together a wealth of knowledge gathered by automatic memory management researchers and developers over the past fifty years. The authors compare the most important approaches and state-of-the-art techniques in a single, accessible framework. </p><p/><p>The book addresses new challenges to garbage collection made by recent advances in hardware and software. It explores the consequences of these changes for designers and implementers of high performance garbage collectors. Along with simple and traditional algorithms, the book covers parallel, incremental, concurrent, and real-time garbage collection. Algorithms and concepts are often described with pseudocode and illustrations.</p><p/><p>The nearly universal adoption of garbage collection by modern programming languages makes a thorough understanding of this topic essential for any programmer. This authoritative handbook gives expert insight on how different collectors work as well as the various issues currently facing garbage collectors. Armed with this knowledge, programmers can confidently select and configure the many choices of garbage collectors. </p><p><strong><em>Web Resource<br/></em></strong>The book’s online bibliographic database at www.gchandbook.org includes over 2,500 garbage collection-related publications. Continually updated, it contains abstracts for some entries and URLs or DOIs for most of the electronically available ones. The database can be searched online or downloaded as BibTeX, PostScript, or PDF. </p><p><strong><em>E-book<br/></em></strong>This edition enhances the print version with copious clickable links to algorithms, figures, original papers and definitions of technical terms. In addition, each index entry links back to where it was mentioned in the text, and each entry in the bibliography includes links back to where it was cited.</p></span>",

Manage information like a pro, to achieve much better financial results for the enterprise, more efficient processes, and multiple advantages over competitors.</p><p>As you’ll discover in <em>Enterprise Information Management in Practice</em>, EIM deals with both structured data (e.g. sales data and customer data) as well as unstructured data (like customer satisfaction forms, emails, documents, social network sentiments, and so forth). With the deluge of information that enterprises face given their global operations and complex business models, as well as the advent of big data technology, it is not surprising that making sense of the large piles of data is of paramount importance. Enterprises must therefore put much greater emphasis on managing and monetizing both structured and unstructured data.</p><p>As Saumya Chaki—an information management expert and consultant with IBM—explains in <em>Enterprise Information Management in Practice</em>, it is now more important than ever before to have an enterprise information strategy that covers the entire life cycle of information and its consumption while providing security controls. </p><p>With Fortune 100 consultant Saumya Chaki as your guide, <em>Enterprise Information Management in Practice </em>covers each of these and the other pillars of EIM in depth, which provide readers with a comprehensive view of the building blocks for EIM. </p><p>Enterprises today deal with complex business environments where information demands take place in real time, are complex, and often serve as the differentiator among competitors. The effective management of information is thus crucial in managing enterprises. Enterprise Information Management (EIM) has evolved as a specialized discipline in the business intelligence and enterprise data warehousing space to address the complex needs of information processing and delivery—and to ensure the enterprise is making the most of its information assets. </p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Why do we teach information literacy? This book argues that the main purpose of information literacy teaching in higher education is to enhance student learning. With the impact of new technologies, a proliferation of information sources and a change in the student demography, information literacy has become increasingly important in academia. Also, students that know how to learn have a better chance of adapting their learning strategies to the demands of higher education, and thus completing their degree.</p><p>The authors discuss the various aspects of how academic integrity and information literacy are linked to learning, and provide examples on how our theories can be put into practice. The book also provides insight on the normative side of higher education, namely academic formation and the personal development process of students.

With KNIME, you can use the easy-to-use drag-and-drop interface, if you are not an experienced coder. But if you know how to work with languages such as R, Python, or Java, you can use them as well. This makes KNIME a truly flexible and versatile tool.</p><p>In this course, we will learn the efficient ways to import multiple files into KNIME, loops, web scraping, scripting (using Python code in KNIME), hyperparameter optimization, and feature selection. Also, learn basic machine learning workflows and helpful nodes for this in KNIME.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will be able to use KNIME for data cleaning and data preparation without any code.</p><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p>This course is designed for aspiring data scientists and data analysts who want to work smarter, faster, and more efficiently. This course is also for anyone who wants to learn how to effectively clean data or encounter various data issues (for example, format) in the past and is looking for a solid solution, and who is familiar with KNIME as no basics are covered in this course. Basic knowledge of machine learning is certainly helpful for the later lectures in this course. Note: Tableau Desktop and Microsoft Power BI Desktop are optional.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>Companies working to become data driven often view data scientists as heroes, but that overlooks the vital role that data engineers play in the process. While data scientists focus on finding new insights from datasets, data engineers deal with preparation—obtaining, cleaning, and creating enhanced versions of the data an organization needs. In this report, Andy Oram examines how the role of data engineer has quickly evolved.</p><p>DBAs, software engineers, developers, and students will explore the responsibilities of modern data engineers and the skills and tools necessary to do the job. You’ll learn how to deal with software engineering concepts such as rapid and continuous development, automation and orchestration, modularity, and traceability. Decision makers considering a move to the cloud will also benefit from the in-depth discussion this report provides.</p><p>This report covers:</p><ul><li>Major tasks of data engineers today</li><li>The different levels of structure in data and ways to maximize its value</li><li>Capabilities of third-party cloud options</li><li>Tools for ingestion, transfer, and enrichment</li><li>Using containers and VMs to run the tools</li><li>Software engineering development</li><li>Automation and orchestration of data engineering</li></ul></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p>The world has become digital and technological advances have multiplied circuits with access to data, their processing and their diffusion. New technologies have now reached a certain maturity. Data are available to everyone, anywhere on the planet. The number of Internet users in 2014 was 2.9 billion or 41% of the world population. The need for knowledge is becoming apparent in order to understand this multitude of data. We must educate, inform and train the masses. The development of related technologies, such as the advent of the Internet, social networks, \"cloud-computing\" (digital factories), has increased the available volumes of data. Currently, each individual creates, consumes, uses digital information: more than 3.4 million e-mails are sent worldwide every second, or 107,000 billion annually with 14,600 e-mails per year per person, but more than 70% are spam. Billions of pieces of content are shared on social networks such as Facebook, more than 2.46 million every minute. We spend more than 4.8 hours a day on the Internet using a computer, and 2.1 hours using a mobile. Data, this new ethereal manna from heaven, is produced in real time. It comes in a continuous stream from a multitude of sources which are generally heterogeneous. </p><p>This accumulation of data of all types (audio, video, files, photos, etc.) generates new activities, the aim of which is to analyze this enormous mass of information. It is then necessary to adapt and try new approaches, new methods, new knowledge and new ways of working, resulting in new properties and new challenges since SEO logic must be created and implemented. At company level, this mass of data is difficult to manage. Its interpretation is primarily a challenge. This impacts those who are there to \"manipulate\" the mass and requires a specific infrastructure for creation, storage, processing, analysis and recovery. The biggest challenge lies in \"the valuing of data\" available in quantity, diversity and access speed.</p></span></span></span>",

In a world with a shortage of developers, this is bad news. More code also increases maintenance costs and the risk of bugs, meaning less time is spent improving the quality of systems. </p><p></p><p>You will learn that by making relationships first-class citizens within an item/relationship model, you can develop an extremely compact query language, inspired by natural language.

Authors Tomasz Tunguz and Frank Bien draw on extensive background in big data, business intelligence, and business strategy to provide a blueprint for companies looking to move head-on into the data wave. Instrumentation is discussed in detail, but the core of the change is in the culture—this book provides sound guidance on building the type of organizational culture that creates and leverages data daily, in every aspect of the business. Real-world examples illustrate these important concepts at work: you'll learn how data helped Warby-Parker disrupt a $13 billion monopolized market, how ThredUp uses data to process more than 20 thousand items of clothing every day, how Venmo leverages data to build better products, how HubSpot empowers their salespeople to be more productive, and more. From decision making and strategy to shipping and sales, this book shows you how data makes better business.</p><p>Big data has taken on buzzword status, but there is little real guidance for companies seeking everyday business data solutions.

    "description": "<span><p><b>Don't fly blind. See how the power of experiments works for you.</b></p><p>When it comes to improving customer experiences, trying out new business models, or developing new products, even the most experienced managers often get it wrong. They discover that intuition, experience, and big data alone don't work. What does? Running disciplined business experiments. And what if companies roll out new products or introduce new customer experiences without running these experiments? They fly blind.</p><p>That's what Harvard Business School professor Stefan Thomke shows in this rigorously researched and eye-opening book. It guides you through best practices in business experimentation, illustrates how these practices work at leading companies, and answers some fundamental questions: What makes a good experiment? How do you test in online and brick-and-mortar businesses? In B2B and B2C? How do you build an experimentation culture? Also, best practice means running many experiments. Indeed, some hugely successful companies, such as Amazon, Booking.com, and Microsoft, run tens of thousands of controlled experiments annually, engaging millions of users. Thomke shows us how these and many other organizations prove that experimentation provides significant competitive advantage.</p><p>How can managers create this capability at their own companies? Essential is developing an <i>experimentation organization</i> that prizes the science of testing and puts the discipline of experimentation at the center of its innovation process. While it once took companies years to develop the tools for such large-scale experiments, advances in technology have put these tools at the fingertips of almost any business professional. By combining the power of software and the rigor of controlled experiments, today's managers can make better decisions, create magical customer experiences, and generate big financial returns.</p><p><i>Experimentation Works</i> is your guidebook to a truly new way of thinking and innovating.</p></span>",

Simon adroitly shows how Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Twitter, and other tech heavyweights use powerful data visualization tools to garner fascinating insights into their businesses. But make no mistake: these companies are hardly alone. Organizations of all types, industries, sizes are representing their data in new and amazing ways.

This book is intended to describe the benefits of data mining in business, the process and typical business applications, the workings of basic data mining models, and demonstrate each with widely available free software. The book focuses on demonstrating common business data mining applications. It provides exposure to the data mining process, to include problem identification, data management, and available modeling tools. The book takes the approach of demonstrating typical business data sets with open source software. KNIME is a very easy-to-use tool, and is used as the primary means of demonstration. R is much more powerful and is a commercially viable data mining tool. We also demonstrate WEKA, which is a highly useful academic software, although it is difficult to manipulate test sets and new cases, making it problematic for commercial use.</p></span>",

He shares with you his wealth of object modeling\nexperience and his keen eye for identifying repeating problems and\ntransforming them into reusable models. <b>Analysis Patterns</b>\nprovides a catalogue of patterns that have emerged in a wide range\nof domains including trading, measurement, accounting and\norganizational relationships.</p><p>Recognizing that conceptual patterns cannot exist in isolation,\nthe author also presents a series of \"support patterns\" that\ndiscuss how to turn conceptual models into software that in turn\nfits into an architecture for a large information system. Included\nin each pattern is the reasoning behind their design, rules for\nwhen they should and should not be used, and tips for\nimplementation. The examples presented in this book comprise a\ncookbook of useful models and insight into the skill of reuse that\nwill improve analysis, modeling and implementation.</p></span></span>",

Focusing on subspace approaches to system identification problems, this book teaches readers to identify models quickly and incorporate them into various processing problems including state estimation, tracking, detection, classification, controls, communications, and other applications that require reliable models that can be adapted to dynamic environments. </p><p>The extraction of a model from data is vital to numerous applications, from the detection of submarines to determining the epicenter of an earthquake to controlling an autonomous vehicles—all requiring a fundamental understanding of their underlying processes and measurement instrumentation. Emphasizing real-world solutions to a variety of model development problems, this text demonstrates how model-based subspace identification system identification enables the extraction of a model from measured data sequences from simple time series polynomials to complex constructs of parametrically adaptive, nonlinear distributed systems. In addition, this resource features:</p><ul><li>Kalman filtering for linear, linearized, and nonlinear systems; modern unscented Kalman filters; as well as Bayesian particle filters</li><li>Practical processor designs including comprehensive methods of performance analysis</li><li>Provides a link between model development and practical applications in model-based signal processing</li><li>Offers in-depth examination of the subspace approach that applies subspace algorithms to synthesized examples and actual applications</li><li>Enables readers to bridge the gap from statistical signal processing to subspace identification</li><li>Includes appendices, problem sets, case studies, examples, and notes for MATLAB</li></ul><p><i>Model-Based Processing: An Applied Subspace Identification Approach</i> is essential reading for advanced undergraduate and graduate students of engineering and science as well as engineers working in industry and academia. </p></span>",

Pundits predicted that information technology would spell the end of almost everything—from mass media to bureaucracies, universities, politics, and governments. Clearly, we are not living in that future. <i>The Social Life of Information</i> explains why.</p><p>John Seely Brown and Paul Duguid show us how to look beyond mere information to the social context that creates and gives meaning to it. Arguing elegantly for the important role that human sociability plays, even—perhaps especially—in the digital world, <i>The Social Life of Information</i> gives us an optimistic look beyond the simplicities of information and individuals. It shows how a better understanding of the contribution that communities, organizations, and institutions make to learning, working, and innovating can lead to the richest possible use of technology in our work and everyday lives.</p><p/>With a new introduction by David Weinberger and reflections by the authors on developments since the book’s first publication, this new edition is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the human place in a digital world.\n\n  </span>",

    "description": "<span><p><i>Transliteracy in Complex Information Environments</i> considers this relatively new concept, which has attracted a great deal of interest in the library and  information field, particularly among practitioners. The notion of transliteracy arises in the context of increasingly complex information and communication environments characterised by multimodality and new roles of creators and consumers. Transliteracy concerns the ability to apply and transfer a range of skills and contextual insights to a variety of settings. Rather than focusing on any one skillset or technology, transliteracy is about fluidity of movement across a range of contexts. This book is concerned with processes of learning and knowledge creation. An understanding of transliteracy emergesfrom research data gathered in university and high school settings. Transliteracy is considered in relation to other literacies as an overarching framework. Applications in education and lifelong learning are discussed. Social aspects of transliteracy are considered in relation to academic cultures and broader social trends, particularly hybrid cultures</p><ul><li>Provides an overarching model of transliteracy based on the well-established information literacy</li><li>Relates to a number of professional and academic fields, such as library and information, education, communication, media, and cultural studies</li><li>Integrates both professional and academic perspectives </li></ul></span>",

    "title": "Creating and Maintaining an Information Literacy Instruction Program in the Twenty-First Century",
    "description": "<span>\nThe Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) set forth Characteristics of Programs of Information Literacy that Illustrate Best Practices: A Guideline. Creating and Maintaining an Information Literacy Instruction Program in the Twenty-First Century provides readers with a real-world, practical guide for creating an instruction program step-by-step, as well as a framework for reviewing, assessing, and updating existing programs. Each chapter focuses on one of the main aspects of the ACRL guidelines. Current research, anecdotal evidence and tools provide the reader with the support and instruments needed to either begin, or reinvigorate, an instruction program.<br/><br/>The book begins by placing information literacy in programme context. It then covers how to survey your current program, and how to develop and implementing a program plan. The next chapters concentrate on administrative and institutional support; curriculum integration and campus collaboration; present and future students; pedagogy for the information professional; program marketing and outreach; assessment and future trends. Finally, this book concludes by asking its readers to re-survey their information literacy instruction program landscape once again.<ul><li>Provides a practical, scalable information literacy instruction program framework based upon the 2011 draft ACRL Characteristics of Programs of Information Literacy that Illustrate Best Practices</li><li>Reflects current scholarship and practice</li><li>Contains sample worksheets, templates, and assessment instruments</li></ul>\n</span>",

They describe Klein's published and unpublished views on the topic, and then consider the way the concept has been variously described, evolved, accepted, rejected and modified by analysts of different schools of thought and in various locations – Britain, Western Europe, North America and Latin America.</p><p></p><p>The authors believe that this unusually widespread interest in a particular concept and its varied ‘fate’ has occurred not only because of beliefs about its clinical usefulness in the psychoanalytic setting but also because projective identification is a universal aspect of human interaction and communication.　　 </p><p></p><p><em>Projective Identification: The Fate of a Concept</em> will appeal to any psychoanalyst or psychotherapist who uses the ideas of transference and counter-transference, as well as to academics wanting further insight into the evolution of this concept as it moves between different cultures and countries.　 </p></span>",

The chapters bring a variety of perspectives to bear on a single cluster of problems involving the acquisition of word reading ability. It is the editors' keen hope that the insights and findings of the research reported here will influence and become incorporated into the development of practicable, classroom-based instructional programs that succeed in improving children's ability to become skilled readers. Furthermore, they hope that these insights and findings will become incorporated into the working knowledge that teachers apply when they teach their students to read, and into further research on reading acquisition.<br/>\n\n  </span>",

This title provides an alternative perspective for understanding information services and digital literacy, and argues that a central problem in the age of the social web and the culture of participation is that we do not know the premises of how we know, and how ways of interacting with information affect our actions and their outcomes. Information seeking is always a question of crossing and expanding boundaries between our earlier experiences and the unknown.

It includes descriptions of curriculums for the methods currently available and describes a range of objectives the curriculums meet and the common environments librarians use for instruction. Information Literacy Instruction also introduces two new ideas for methods of instruction: one which combines information literacy with cyber-literacy (MLI) forming an instructional method appropriate for internet users and internet information and the Fully Automated Reference Instruction (FARI) that actively involves users with the instruction while completing research they are currently involved in for specific targeted classes.<ul><li>Introduction to multi-literacy instruction</li><li>Using instruction to protect users from disinformation on the Internet</li><li>New active learning idea for web based instruction (MLI and FARI)</li></ul>\n</span>",

    "description": "<span>This book has been written with a view to understand the validity of the perceptions of Open Access (OA) e-journals in the Library and Information Science (LIS) field. Using relevant OA journals this book presents and evaluates journals qualitatively and quantitatively. Over the last three hundred years scholarly journals have been the prime mode of transport in communicating the scholarly research process. However in the last few decades, a changing scenario has been witnessed in their form and format. OA is an innovative idea that attracts a fair amount of support and opposition around the world because it bridges the gap between digitally divided scholars by solving the pricing and permission crises that have imbalanced the scholarly communication process. Some scholars are of the opinion that OA has led to a chaotic environment where anyone can publish anything. Scholarly Communication in Library and Information Services records, in detail, the impact by accessing the journals’ web site qualitatively and quantitatively in measuring the important elements such as articles, authors, countries, subjects and cited references. Finally, the book calculates the impact factor using synchronous and asynchronous approaches.<br/><br/><ul><li>First ever study to extensively evaluate LIS Journals’ Web site qualitatively by using a newly developed set of criteria</li><li>LIS OA journals are also evaluated quantitatively</li><li>Counts citations of LIS OA articles in terms of formal citations by using Google Scholar</li></ul></span>",

Designed to seek profit and power, it has pursued both with endless tenacity, steadily bending the framework of law and even challenging the sovereign status of the state. Where did the corporation come from? How did it get so much power? What is its ultimate trajectory?<br/>After he sold his successful computer book publishing business to a large corporation, Ted Nace felt increasingly driven to find answers to these questions. In Gangs of America he details the rise of corporate power in America through a series of fascinating stories, each organized around a different facet of the central question: \"How did corporations get more rights than people?\" Beginning with the origin of the corporation in medieval Great Britain, Nace traces both the events that shaped the evolution of corporate power and the colorful personalities who played major roles. Gangs of America is a uniquely accessible synthesis of the latest scholarly research, a compelling historical narrative, and a distinctive personal voice.\n  </span>",

    "title": "America As Empire",
    "description": "<span>\n    In America as Empire, Jim Garrison urges us to face up to the complexities and responsibilities inherent in the indisputable fact that America is now the world's single preeminent power. \"America\", Garrison writes, \"has become what it was founded not to be: established as a haven for those fleeing the abuse of power, it has attained and now wields near absolute power. It has become an empire.\"<br/>Garrison traces the roots of the American empire to the very beginnings of the republic, in particular to the historic willingness of United States' to use military might in the defense of two consistent --- if sometimes contradictory --- foreign policy objectives: protection of American commercial interests and promotion of democracy.<br/>How long can the American empire last? Garrison looks at American history within the context of the rise and fall of empires and argues that the U. S. can gain important insights into durability from the Romans. He details the interplay between military power, political institutions, and legal structures that enabled the Roman empire at it's apogee to last for longer than America has as a country.<br/>But the real question is, what kind of empire can and should America be? As the sole superpower, America must lead in shaping a new global order, just as after World War II Roosevelt and Truman took the lead in shaping a new international order. That international order is now crumbling under the pressures of globalization, persistent poverty, terrorism and fundamentalism. Garrison outlines the kinds of cooperative global structures America must promote if its empire is to leave a lasting legacy of greatness. Garrison calls for Americans to consciously see themselves as a transitional empire, one whose task is not to dominate but to catalyze the next generation of global governance mechanisms that would make obsolete the need for empire. If this is done, America could be the final empire.\n  </span>",

You will see the typical data science steps and techniques utilized by data professionals. Next, you will build a simple chatbot so you can get a clear sense of what is involved.</p><p>The next part is an introduction to data science in Python. You will have an opportunity to master Python for data science as each section is followed by an assignment to practice your skills. By the end of the section, you will understand Python fundamentals, decision and looping structures, Python functions, how to work with nested data, and list comprehension. Finally, we will wrap up the two most popular libraries for data science—NumPy and Pandas.</p><p>The last part delves into essential math for data science. You will get the hang of linear algebra along with probability and statistics. Our goal for the linear algebra part is to introduce all necessary concepts and intuition for an in-depth understanding of an often-utilized technique for data fitting called least squares. We will spend a lot of time on probability, both classical and Bayesian, as reasoning about problems is a much more difficult aspect than simply running statistics.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will understand data science methodology and how to use essential math in your real projects.</p><p><b>Audience</b></p><p>This course is designed for people who are new to data science or who are interested in pursuing a career in data science, as well as those who wish to obtain a broad overview before diving into specialized data science topics.</p><p>This course will also benefit students who want to master the fundamental arithmetic for data science or obtain an introduction to data science in Python.</p><p>You need not have any prior experience in data science to take up this course.</p></span>",

This book brings together economics and data science.<div><br/></div><div>Author Tshepo Chris Nokeri begins by introducing you to covariance analysis, correlation analysis, cross-validation, hyperparameter optimization, regression analysis, and residual analysis. In addition, he presents an approach to contend with multi-collinearity. He then debunks a time series model recognized as the additive model. He reveals a technique for binarizing an economic feature to perform classification analysis using logistic regression. He brings in the Hidden Markov Model, used to discover hidden patterns and growth in the world economy. The author demonstrates unsupervised machine learning techniques such as principal component analysis and cluster analysis. Key deep learning concepts and ways of structuring artificial neural networks are explored along with training them and assessing their performance. The Monte Carlo simulation technique is applied to stimulate the purchasing power of money in an economy. Lastly, the Structural Equation Model (SEM) is considered to integrate correlation analysis, factor analysis, multivariate analysis, causal analysis, and path analysis.<div><br/></div><div>After reading this book, you should be able to recognize the connection between econometrics and data science. You will know how to apply a machine learning approach to modeling complex economic problems and others  beyond this book.

Their goal is to efficiently deal with ever-growing volumes of heterogeneous data, while also facing various sophisticated user needs. However, defining and building a data lake is still a challenge, as no consensus has been reached so far. Data Lakes presents recent outcomes and trends in the field of data repositories. The main topics discussed are the data-driven architecture of a data lake; the management of metadata – supplying key information about the stored data, master data and reference data; the roles of linked data and fog computing in a data lake ecosystem; and how gravity principles apply in the context of data lakes. A variety of case studies are also presented, thus providing the reader with practical examples of data lake management.<br/>   </p></span>",

KNIME makes the data prep process efficient and easy. With KNIME, you can use the easy-to-use drag-and-drop interface, if you are not an experienced coder. But if you know how to work with languages such as R, Python, or Java, you can use them as well. This makes KNIME a truly flexible and versatile tool.</p><p>In this course, we will learn how to use additional helpful KNIME nodes not covered in the other two classes. Solve data cleaning challenges together for different datasets. Use pre-trained models in TensorFlow in KNIME (involves Python coding).\n</p><p>Also, learn the fundamentals for NLP tasks (Natural Language Processing) in KNIME using only KNIME nodes (without any additional coding).</p><p>By the end of this course, you will be able to use KNIME for data cleaning and data preparation without any code.</p><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p>This course is designed for aspiring data scientists and data analysts who want to work smarter, faster, and more efficiently. This course is also for anyone who wants to learn how to effectively clean data or encounter various data issues (for example, format) in the past and is looking for a solid solution, and who is familiar with KNIME as no basics are covered in this course. Basic knowledge of machine learning is certainly helpful for the later lectures in this course. Note: Tableau Desktop and Microsoft Power BI Desktop are optional.</p></span>",

    "title": "Modern Big Data Architectures",
    "description": "<span><p><b>Provides an up-to-date analysis of big data and multi-agent systems</b></p><p>The term Big Data refers to the cases, where data sets are too large or too complex for traditional data-processing software. With the spread of new concepts such as Edge Computing or the Internet of Things, production, processing and consumption of this data becomes more and more distributed. As a result, applications increasingly require multiple agents that can work together. A multi-agent system (MAS) is a self-organized computer system that comprises multiple intelligent agents interacting to solve problems that are beyond the capacities of individual agents. <i>Modern Big Data Architectures </i>examines modern concepts and architecture for Big Data processing and analytics.</p><p>This unique, up-to-date volume provides joint analysis of big data and multi-agent systems, with emphasis on distributed, intelligent processing of very large data sets. Each chapter contains practical examples and detailed solutions suitable for a wide variety of applications. The author, an internationally-recognized expert in Big Data and distributed Artificial Intelligence, demonstrates how base concepts such as agent, actor, and micro-service have reached a point of convergence—enabling next generation systems to be built by incorporating the best aspects of the field. This book:</p><ul><li>Illustrates how data sets are produced and how they can be utilized in various areas of industry and science</li><li>Explains how to apply common computational models and state-of-the-art architectures to process Big Data tasks</li><li>Discusses current and emerging Big Data applications of Artificial Intelligence</li></ul><p><i>Modern Big Data Architectures: A Multi-Agent Systems Perspective </i>is a timely and important resource for data science professionals and students involved in Big Data analytics, and machine and artificial learning. </p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>Presented by Chris Lindner – Manager, Product Science at Indeed</p><p>Over the past decade, data science has exploded as a lucrative, high-demand career. During this time, we’ve seen rapid expansion in both the demand for data scientists, and for the number of individuals trying to get into the field. But what exactly does the title “data scientist” even mean? Who are these “data scientists,” and where do they come from? Are we becoming overly flooded with data science candidates? What emerging trends do we see as more and more jobseekers enter the market to meet this growing demand? Indeed is the world’s #1 job site. Using our data on job postings, searches, and resumes, I’ll try to explore the answers to some of these questions, and paint a picture of what the job market looks like today, and where it is going in 2020 and beyond.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>Though we have in the past depended on traditional data warehouses to drive business intelligence from data, they were generally based on databases and structured data formats and proved insufficient for the challenges that the current data-driven world faces. Enter data lakes, which are optimized for unstructured and semistructured data, can scale to petabytes easily, and allow better integration of a wide range of tools to help businesses get the most out of their data. Data and software professionals are now moving toward a disaggregated architecture, which makes each layer much more independent and allows them to use the perfect tool for each job.</p><p>California State University took a different approach by residing most of their logic within a programming framework that allowed them to build a testable platform. By applying DataOps techniques, they were able to create reusable, scalable, and extensible data architectures.</p><p>Recorded on November 2, 2021.

    "description": "<span><p>\"Big Data\" is on the covers of Science, Nature, the Economist, and Wired magazines, on the front pages of the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times. But despite the media hyperbole, as Christine Borgman points out in this examination of data and scholarly research, having the right data is usually better than having more data; little data can be just as valuable as big data. In many cases, there are no data-because relevant data don't exist, cannot be found, or are not available. Moreover, data sharing is difficult, incentives to do so are minimal, and data practices vary widely across disciplines.</p>\n\n<p>Borgman, an often-cited authority on scholarly communication, argues that data have no value or meaning in isolation; they exist within a knowledge infrastructure-an ecology of people, practices, technologies, institutions, material objects, and relationships. After laying out the premises of her investigation-six \"provocations\" meant to inspire discussion about the uses of data in scholarship-Borgman offers case studies of data practices in the sciences, the social sciences, and the humanities, and then considers the implications of her findings for scholarly practice and research policy. To manage and exploit data over the long term, Borgman argues, requires massive investment in knowledge infrastructures; at stake is the future of scholarship.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Presented by Kelsey Redman – AVP, Data Science at Comerica Bank</p><p>Purchasing 3rd party data on individuals can give great insights on customers, but first we have to know which individuals from that outside data source are actually customers and which are just prospects. Without a unique identifier like SSN or Driver’s License number from the 3rd party data, we have to use a combination of name, address, and demographic information to identify the matching customer. Between nicknames, misspelled names and addresses, and family members with similar names all at one address, this quickly becomes a difficult task involving heavy data cleanup and an increasingly complicated series of rules. In this presentation, we demonstrate some techniques to help resolve these entities across data sources by employing the use of supervised classification machine learning techniques to quantify and predict entity “likeness.” We showcase some of the challenges we faced with exploring other entity resolution methods, with manually labeling a comprehensive training set, and how this approach might extend to solve other data issues.</p></span>",

The videos present you with applied, example-driven lessons in Python and its associated ecosystem of libraries, where you get your hands dirty with real datasets and see real results. <br/><br/><strong>Description</strong><br/><strong> </strong><br/>\nIf nothing else, by the end of this video course you will have analyzed a number of datasets from the wild, built a handful of applications, and applied machine learning algorithms in meaningful ways to get real results. And all along the way you learn the best practices and computational techniques used by professional data scientists. You get hands-on experience with the PyData ecosystem by manipulating and modeling data. You explore and transform data with the pandas library, perform statistical analysis with SciPy and NumPy, build regression models with statsmodels, and train machine learning algorithms with scikit-learn. All throughout the course you learn to test your assumptions and models by engaging in rigorous validation. Finally, you learn how to share your results through effective data visualization. </p><p><strong>Code:</strong><a href=\"https://github.com/hopelessoptimism/data-science-fundamentals\">https://github.com/hopelessoptimism/data-science-fundamentals</a><br/><strong>Resources: </strong><a href=\"http://hopelessoptimism.com/data-science-fundamentals\">http://hopelessoptimism.com/data-science-fundamentals</a><br/><strong>Forum:</strong><a href=\"https://gitter.im/data-science-fundamentals\">https://gitter.im/data-science-fundamentals</a><br/><strong>Data:</strong><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/galvanize-example-data/spark-live-lessons-data.zip\"><strong> </strong></a><a href=\"http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html\">http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html</a><br/><br/><strong>About the Instructor</strong><strong> </strong><br/>\n Jonathan Dinu is an author, researcher, and most importantly educator. He is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon's Human Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) where he is working to democratize machine learning and artificial intelligence through interpretable and interactive algorithms. Previously, he founded Zipfian Academy (an immersive data science training program acquired by Galvanize), has taught classes at the University of San Francisco, and has built a Data Visualization MOOC with Udacity. In addition to his professional data science experience, he has run data science trainings for a Fortune 500 company and taught workshops at Strata, PyData, and DataWeek (among others). He first discovered his love of all things data while studying Computer Science and Physics at UC Berkeley, and in a former life he worked for Alpine Data Labs developing distributed machine learning algorithms for predictive analytics on Hadoop. <br/>\n<strong> </strong> <br/>\n Jonathan has always had a passion for sharing the things he has learned in the most creative ways he can. When he is not working with students you can find him blogging about data, visualization, and education at<a href=\"http://hopelessoptimism.com\"> hopelessoptimism.com</a> or rambling on Twitter @jonathandinu. </p><p><strong>Skill Level</strong></p><ul><li>Beginner</li></ul><p><strong>What You Will Learn</strong></p><ul><li>How to get up and running with a Python data science environment</li><li>The basics of the data science process and what each step entails</li><li>How (and why) to perform exploratory data analysis in Python with the pandas library</li><li>The theory of statistical estimation to make inferences from your data and test hypotheses </li><li>The fundamentals of probability and how to use scipy to work with distributions in Python</li><li>How to build and evaluate machine learning models with scikit-learn</li><li>The basics of data visualization and how to communicate your results effectively</li><li>The importance of creating reproducible analyses and how to share them effectively</li></ul><p><strong>Who Should Take This Course</strong></p><ul><li>Aspiring data scientists looking to break into the field and learn the essentials necessary.</li><li>Journalists, consultants, analysts, or anyone else who works with data looking to take a programmatic approach to exploring data and conducting analyses. </li><li>Quantitative researchers interested in applying theory to real projects and taking a computational approach to modeling.</li><li>Software engineers interested in building intelligent applications driven by machine learning.</li><li>Practicing data scientists already familiar with another programming environment looking to learn how to do data science with Python.</li></ul><p><strong>Course Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Basic understanding of programming.</li><li>Familiarity with Python and statistics are a plus.</li></ul><p><strong>Lesson 7: Exploring Data—Analysis and Visualization</strong></p><p>Lesson 7 starts with a short historical diversion on the process and evolution of exploratory data analysis, to help you understand the context behind it. John Tukey, the godfather of EDA, said in the <em>Future of Data Analysis</em> that \"Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise.\" </p><p>Next you use matplotlib and seaborn, two Python visualization libraries, to learn how to visually explore a single dimension with histograms and boxplots. But a single dimension can only get us so far. By using scatterplots and other charts for higher dimensional visualization you see how to compare columns of our data to look for relationships between them. </p><p>The lesson finishes with a cautionary tale of when statistics lie by exploring the impact of mixed effects and Simpson's paradox. </p><p><strong>Lesson 8: Making Inferences—Statistical Estimation and Evaluation</strong></p><p>In Lesson 8 we lay the groundwork for the methods and theory we need to make inferences from data, starting with an overview of the various approaches and techniques that are part of the rich history of statistical analysis. </p><p>Next you see how to leverage computational- and sampling-based approaches to make inferences from your data. After learning the basics of hypothesis testing, one of the most used techniques in the data scientist's tool belt, you see how to use it to optimize a web application with A/B testing. All along the way you learn to appreciate the importance of uncertainty and see how to bound your reasoning with confidence intervals. </p><p>And finally, the lesson finishes by discussing the age-old question of correlation versus causation, why it matters, and how to account for it in your analyses. </p><p><strong>Lesson 9: Statistical Modeling and Machine Learning</strong></p><p>In Lesson 9 you learn how to leverage statistical models to build a powerful model to predict AirBnB listing prices and infer which listings are undervalued. It starts with a primer on probability and statistical distributions using SciPy and NumPy, including how to estimate parameters and fit distributions to data. </p><p>Next you learn about the theory of regression through a hands-on application with our AirBnB data and see how to model correlations in your data. By solving for the line of best fit and seeing how to understand its coefficients you can make inferences about your data. </p><p>But building a model is only one side of the coin, and if you cannot effectively evaluate how well it performs it might as well be useless. Next you learn how to evaluate a regression model, learn about what could go wrong when fitting a model, and learn to overcome these challenges. </p><p>The lesson finishes by talking about the differences between and nuances of statistics, modeling, and machine learning. I provide an overview of the various types of models and algorithms used for machine learning and introduce how to leverage scikit-learn—a robust machine learning library in Python—to make predictions. </p><p><strong>About LiveLessons Video Training</strong><br/><br/>\n The LiveLessons Video Training series publishes hundreds of hands-on, expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

    "description": "<span><div><p>Data professionals are confronting the most disruptive change since relational databases appeared in the 1980s. SQL is still a major tool for data analytics, but conventional relational database management systems can’t handle the increasing size and complexity of today’s datasets. This updated edition teaches you best practices for Greenplum Database, the open source massively parallel processing (MPP) database that accommodates large sets of nonrelational and relational data.</p><p>Marshall Presser, field CTO at Pivotal, introduces Greenplum’s approach to data analytics and data-driven decisions, beginning with its shared-nothing architecture. IT managers, developers, data analysts, system architects, and data scientists will all gain from exploring data organization and storage, data loading, running queries, and learning to perform analytics in the database. Discover how MPP and Greenplum will help you go beyond the traditional data warehouse.</p><p>This ebook covers:</p><ul><li>Greenplum features, use case examples, and techniques for optimizing use</li><li>Four Greenplum deployment options to help you balance security, cost, and time to usability</li><li>Why each networked node in Greenplum’s architecture includes an independent operating system, memory, and storage</li><li>Additional tools for monitoring, managing, securing, and optimizing query responses in the Pivotal Greenplum commercial database</li></ul></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Design great databases—from logical data modeling through physical schema definition. You will learn a framework that finally cracks the problem of merging data and process models into a meaningful and unified design that accounts for how data is actually used in production systems.</p><p>Key to the framework is a method for taking the logical data model that is a static look at the definition of the data, and merging that static look with the process models describing how the data will be used in actual practice once a given system is implemented. The approach solves the disconnect between the static definition of data in the logical data model and the dynamic flow of the data in the logical process models.</p><p>The design framework in this book can be used to create operational databases for transaction processing systems, or for data warehouses in support of decision support systems. The information manager can be a flat file, Oracle Database, IMS, NoSQL, Cassandra, Hadoop, or any other DBMS.</p><p>Usage-Driven Database Design emphasizes practical aspects of design, and speaks to what works, what doesn't work, and what to avoid at all costs.

    "title": "The Tabloid Proteome: Orthogonal use of public proteomics data to derive biologically related protein network",
    "description": "<span><p>Presented by Surya Gupta – Postdoctoral Researcher at VIB-UGent</p><p>Mass-spectrometry based proteomics experiments produces large amounts of data. While typically acquired to answer specific biological questions, these data can also be reused in orthogonal ways to reveal biological knowledge. We have developed a novel method for such orthogonal data reuse of public proteomics data to detect biologically associated protein pairs.</p><p>Mass-spectrometry proteomics experiments were obtained and reprocessed from the PRIDE database. For the identified proteins, we calculated the co-occurrence score, using Jaccard similarity. Protein pairs with score of atleast 0.4 were mapped to five knowledgebases; Reactome, Ensembl, IntAct, BioGRID, and CORUM, to assign potential biological relevance. Of the 2325 protein pairs that pass the Jaccard similarity threshold, we 81% of protein pairs with biological annotation (68% with five knowledgebases and 13% with GO terms). While comparison with randomly selected protein pairs, less than 2% protein pairs were found to be annotated. Furthermore, to extend the usability and accessibility of the detected protein pairs for research community, an online database called Tabloid Proteome was established.</p><p>Our approach shows that by re-using publically available data in a fully orthogonal way, effectively treating these data as a proteome-wide association study, we can extract various biologically meaningful patterns, which moreover, were quite complementary to associations detected by established protein-protein interaction techniques. Additionally, Tabloid Proteome features a simple yet powerful web interface that allows fast and easy access to all these protein associations, with their possible biological annotation.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><div><div>At first glance, the skills required to work in the data science field appear to be self-explanatory. Do not be fooled. Impactful data science demands an interdisciplinary knowledge of business philosophy, project management, salesmanship, presentation, and more. In <b><i>Managing Your Data Science Projects</i></b>, author Robert de Graaf explores important concepts that are frequently overlooked in much of the instructional literature that is available to data scientists new to the field. If your completed models are to be used and maintained most effectively, you must be able to present and sell them within your organization in a compelling way.</div><div><br/></div><div>The value of data science within an organization cannot be overstated. Thus, it is vital that strategies and communication between teams are dexterously managed. Three main ways that data science strategy is used in a company is to research its customers, assess risk analytics, and log operational measurements. These all require different managerial instincts, backgrounds, and experiences, and de Graaf cogently breaks down the unique reasons behind each. They must align seamlessly to eventually be adopted as dynamic models.</div><div><br/></div><div>Data science is a relatively new discipline, and as such, internal processes for it are not as well-developed within an operational business as others. With <b><i>Managing Your Data Science Projects</i></b>, you will learn how to create products that solve important problems for your customers and ensure that the initial success is sustained throughout the product’s intended life. Your users will trust you and your models, and most importantly, you will be a more well-rounded and effectual data scientist throughout your career.</div></div><div><br/></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>Early-career data scientists, managers of data scientists, and those interested in entering the field of data science</div><div><br/></div></div></span>",

    "title": "Creating an extensible 100+ PB real-time big data platform by unifying storage and serving",
    "description": "<span><span><div><p>\n                Uber relies heavily on making data-driven decisions in every product area and needs to store and process an ever-increasing amount of data. But building a reliable big data platform is extremely challenging when it has to store and serve hundreds of petabytes of data in real time. The company redesigned traditional big data platform solutions to provide faster, more reliable, and more performant access by adding a few critical technologies that overcome their limitations.\n            </p><p>\n                Reza Shiftehfar reflects on the challenges faced and proposes architectural solutions to scale a big data platform to ingest, store, and serve 100+ PB of data with minute-level latency while efficiently utilizing the hardware and meeting security needs. You’ll get a behind-the-scenes look at the current big data technology landscape, including various existing open source technologies (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, Hive, Presto, Kafka, and Avro) as well as what Uber’s tools such as Hudi and Marmaray.\n            </p><p>\n                Hudi is an open source analytical storage system created at Uber to manage petabytes of data on HDFS-like distributed storage. Hudi provides near-real-time ingestion and provides different views of the data: a read-optimized view for batch analytics, a real-time view for driving dashboards, and an incremental view for powering data pipelines. Hudi also effectively manages files on underlying storage to maximize operational health and reliability. Reza details how Hudi lowers data latency across the board while simultaneously achieving orders of magnitude of efficiency over traditional batch ingestion. He then makes the case for near-real-time dashboards built on top of Hudi datasets, which can be cheaper than pure streaming architectures.\n            </p><p>\n                Marmaray is an open source plug-in based pipeline platform connecting any arbitrary data source to any data sink. It allows unified and efficient ingestion of raw data from a variety of sources to Hadoop as well as the dispersal of the derived analysis result out of Hadoop to any online data store. Reza explains how Uber built and designed a common set of abstractions to handle both the ingestion and dispersal use cases, along with the challenges and lessons learned from developing the core library and setting up an on-demand self-service workflow. Along the way, you’ll see how Uber scaled the platform to move around billions of records per day.\n            </p><p>\n                You’ll also dive into the technical aspects of how to rearchitect the ingestion platform to bring in 10+ trillion events per day at minute-level latency, how to scale the storage platform, and how to redesign the processing platform to efficiently serve millions of queries and jobs per day. You’ll leave with greater insight into how things work in an extensible modern big data platform and inspired to reenvision your own data platform to make it more generic and flexible for future new requirements.\n            </p><p><b>Prerequisite knowledge</b></p><ul><li>\n                    A high-level familiarity with the big data ecosystem\n                </li><li>\n                    Familiarity with the challenges when data grows beyond a few petabytes\n                </li></ul><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><ul><li>\n                    Learn how to build a modern big data platform that expands beyond 100+ petabytes of data while providing real-time access\n                </li><li>\n                    Explore the internal design and architectural limitations of many popular existing open source big data solutions and how to overcome them to scale your data platform\n                </li><li>\n                    Discover Uber's open-sourced technologies Hudi and Marmaray and how they help push the boundaries on speed and scale of traditional big data platforms\n                </li></ul><p>\n                This session is from the 2019 O'Reilly Strata Conference in New York, NY.\n            </p></div></span></span>",

    "title": "Spotlight on Data: How DoorDash Solved the Global Optimality Problem with Gary Ren",
    "description": "<span><span><div><p>The common algorithmic challenge for the current crop of marketplace companies is efficient matching between two sides of the marketplace. For DoorDash, which focuses on food delivery, this problem is even more difficult because of its three-sided marketplace, where the company must identify the optimal Dasher to fulfill a delivery from a restaurant and bring it to a consumer.</p><p>At its core, this marketplace logistics problem is a core operations research problem called the vehicle routing problem. But DoorDash faces additional challenges: delivery requests come in in real time; most orders need to be delivered immediately; Dashers are in constant movement; and the effects of variance in restaurant operations and real-world events (traffic, weather, etc.) have pronounced effects on the solutions. Thus, finding global optimality in real time becomes intractable. To address these challenges, DoorDash leverages various AI techniques to intelligently model the decision space and achieve near-optimal solutions in seconds.</p><p>In this <i>Spotlight on Data</i>, DoorDash’s Gary Ren explains how his team defined the problem of modeling the marketplace and then implemented machine learning techniques to solve the marketplace matching problem.</p><p>Recorded on December 11, 2019.

Use of data science is driven by the rise of big data and social media, the development of high-performance computing, and the emergence of such powerful methods for data analysis and modeling as deep learning. Data science encompasses a set of principles, problem definitions, algorithms, and processes for extracting non-obvious and useful patterns from large datasets. It is closely related to the fields of data mining and machine learning, but broader in scope. This book offers a brief history of the field, introduces fundamental data concepts, and describes the stages in a data science project. It considers data infrastructure and the challenges posed by integrating data from multiple sources, introduces the basics of machine learning, and discusses how to link machine learning expertise with real-world problems. The book also reviews ethical and legal issues, developments in data regulation, and computational approaches to preserving privacy. Finally, it considers the future impact of data science and offers principles for success in data science projects.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Data mining has become the fastest growing topic of interest in business programs in the past decade. This book is intended to describe the benefits of data mining in business, the process and typical business applications, the workings of basic data mining models, and demonstrate each with widely available free software. The book focuses on demonstrating common business data mining applications. It provides exposure to the data mining process, to include problem identification, data management, and available modeling tools. The book takes the approach of demonstrating typical business data sets with open source software. KNIME is a very easy-to-use tool, and is used as the primary means of demonstration. R is much more powerful and is a commercially viable data mining tool. We also demonstrate WEKA, which is a highly useful academic software, although it is difficult to manipulate test sets and new cases, making it problematic for commercial use.</p></span>",

However, large gaps exist in this workflow, and the data science tool set is rapidly changing to fill those gaps. Large teams and enterprises are quickly moving from using individual siloed notebooks like Zeppelin and Jupyter to wanting to share and reuse models, code, and results. Challenges also exist in deploying models into production and model serving using tools like Kubeflow and TensorFlow.

    "description": "<span><div><p>The information technology revolutions over the past six decades have been astonishing, from mainframes to personal computers to smart and connected economies. But those changes pale in comparison to what’s about to happen. By 2020, seven billion people and roughly 50 billion devices will be connected to the internet, leaving the world awash in data. How do we make sense of it all?</p><p>In this insightful book, Raghunath Nambiar from Cisco examines the role of analytics in enabling digital transformation within the enterprise, including challenges associated with the explosion of data. It embraces the need for analytics at the edge of the network with a local context and analytics at the data center core with a global context. He also explores the differences between the four types of analytics—descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive—including the driving factors behind the need for each of them, as well as the analytical systems required to process them to produce actionable insight.</p><p>Raghu then takes a deep dive into how the explosion in internet connections affects key industries, and how applied analytics will impact our future. Learn how analytics can make a difference in:</p><ul><li><b>Smart cities</b> to manage energy, the environment, traffic, parking, structures, waste, safety, and crowds</li><li><b>Smart energy</b> to enable sustainable and efficient offerings that provide substantial benefits for both providers and customers</li><li><b>Healthcare</b> to address the aging population, growing shortage of physicians,  and rising costs through connected health</li><li><b>Manufacturing</b> for producing higher quality products, creating new lines of business, reducing time-to-market, and increasing revenue growth</li><li><b>Transportation</b> to address the increasing demand through collaborative consumption, connected cars, and the potential for autonomous vehicles</li></ul></div></span>",

While content similarity has been widely explored and utilized by many companies in the media &amp; entertainment industries, it still remains relevant as the amount of data and metadata available continues to grow and change. This talk discusses some of the challenges of content similarity and explores a few different attribute groups (aside from genre and cast) by which content similarity can be measured.</p><p>Traditional attributes, like genre and cast alone, may not be as additive as they once were. More specifically, movies like Ted (starring Mark Wahlberg) and Shaun of the Dead do not neatly fit into a single genre.</p><p>This talk also demonstrates how certain tried and true similarity metrics still yield meaningful and reasonably interpretable results for media &amp; entertainment.</p></span>",

Hands-On Markov Models with Python helps you get to grips with HMMs and different inference algorithms by working on real-world problems. The hands-on examples explored in the book help you simplify the process flow in machine learning by using Markov model concepts, thereby making it accessible to everyone.\n</p><p>Once you've covered the basic concepts of Markov chains, you'll get insights into Markov processes, models, and types with the help of practical examples. After grasping these fundamentals, you'll move on to learning about the different algorithms used in inferences and applying them in state and parameter inference. In addition to this, you'll explore the Bayesian approach of inference and learn how to apply it in HMMs.\n</p><p>In further chapters, you'll discover how to use HMMs in time series analysis and natural language processing (NLP) using Python. You'll also learn to apply HMM to image processing using 2D-HMM to segment images. Finally, you'll understand how to apply HMM for reinforcement learning (RL) with the help of Q-Learning, and use this technique for single-stock and multi-stock algorithmic trading.\n</p><p>By the end of this book, you will have grasped how to build your own Markov and hidden Markov models on complex datasets in order to apply them to projects.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Explore a balance of both theoretical and practical aspects of HMM\n</li><li>Implement HMMs using different datasets in Python using different packages\n</li><li>Understand multiple inference algorithms and how to select the right algorithm to resolve your problems\n</li><li>Develop a Bayesian approach to inference in HMMs\n</li><li>Implement HMMs in finance, natural language processing (NLP), and image processing\n</li><li>Determine the most likely sequence of hidden states in an HMM using the Viterbi algorithm\n</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>Hands-On Markov Models with Python is for you if you are a data analyst, data scientist, or machine learning developer and want to enhance your machine learning knowledge and skills.

Demand is growing exponentially and, left unchecked, will grow to an estimated increase of 20% or more by 2030.<br/> <br/> This book covers the energy consumption and minimization of the different data center components when running real workloads, taking into account the types of instructions executed by the servers. It presents the different air- and liquid-cooled technologies for servers and data centers with some real examples, including waste heat reuse through adsorption chillers, as well as the hardware and software used to measure, model and control energy. It computes and compares the Power Usage Effectiveness and the Total Cost of Ownership of new and existing data centers with different cooling designs, including free cooling and waste heat reuse leading to the Energy Reuse Effectiveness. The book concludes by demonstrating how a well-designed data center reusing waste heat to produce chilled water can reduce energy consumption by roughly 50%, and how renewable energy can be used to create net-zero energy data centers.</p></span>",

But companies are quickly realizing that one of their key bottlenecks is Data Variety—the silo’d nature of the data that is a natural result of internal and external source proliferation. <br/><br/>The problem of big data variety has crept up from the bottom—and the cost of variety is only appreciated when companies attempt to ask simple questions across many business silos (divisions, geographies, functions, etc.). Current top-down, deterministic data unification approaches (such as ETL, ELT, and MDM) were simply not designed to scale to the variety of hundreds or thousands or even tens of thousands of data silos. <br/><br/>Download this free eBook to learn about the fundamental challenges that Data Variety poses to enterprises looking to maximize the value of their existing investments—and how new approaches promise to help organizations embrace and leverage the fundamental diversity of data. Readers will also find best practices for designing bottom-up and probabilistic methods for finding and managing data; principles for doing data science at scale in the big data era; preparing and unifying data in ways that complement existing systems; optimizing data warehousing; and how to use “data ops” to automate large-scale integration.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>Digging for answers to your pressing business questions probably won’t resemble those tidy case studies that lead you step-by-step from data collection to cool insights. Data science is not so clear-cut in the real world. Instead of high-quality data with the right velocity, variety, and volume, many data scientists have to work with missing or sketchy information extracted from people in the organization.</p><p>In this O’Reilly report, Jerry Overton—Distinguished Engineer at global IT leader DXC—introduces practices for making good decisions in a messy and complicated world. What he simply calls “data science that works” is a trial-and-error process of creating and testing hypotheses, gathering evidence, and drawing conclusions. These skills are far more useful for practicing data scientists than, say, mastering the details of a machine-learning algorithm.</p><p>Adapted and expanded from a series of articles Overton published on O’Reilly Radar and on the CSC Blog, each chapter is ideal for current and aspiring data scientists who want to go pro, as well as IT execs and managers looking to hire in this field. The report covers:</p><ul><li>Using the scientific method to gain a competitive advantage</li><li>The skill set you need to look for when choosing a data scientist</li><li>Why practical induction is a key part of thinking like a data scientist</li><li>Best practices for writing solid code in your data science gig</li><li>How agile experimentation lets you find answers (or dead ends) much faster</li><li>Advice for surviving (and even thriving) as a data scientist in your organization</li></ul></div></span>",

Literate Statistical Programming is a workflow that binds the code used in an analysis to the interpretation of the results. While this creates reproducibility it also addresses issues around, auditing, re-usability and allows for rapid iteration and experimentation. This talk will describe a workflow that I have successfully used on small-scale data-sets in start-ups and on Amazon-scale problems in my work on Alexa.

    "description": "<span><p>Small Wars, Big Data provides groundbreaking perspectives for how small wars can be better strategized and favorably won to the benefit of the local population. The authors show that a revolution in the study of conflict-enabled by vast data, rich qualitative evidence, and modern methods-yields new insights into terrorism, civil wars, and foreign interventions. Modern warfare is not about struggles over territory but over people; civilians-and the information they might choose to provide-can turn the tide at critical junctures.</p>\n\n<p>The authors draw practical lessons from the past two decades of conflict in locations ranging from Latin America and the Middle East to Central and Southeast Asia. Building an information-centric understanding of insurgencies, the authors examine the relationships between rebels, the government, and civilians. This approach serves as a springboard for exploring other aspects of modern conflict, including the suppression of rebel activity, the role of mobile communications networks, the links between aid and violence, and why conventional military methods might provide short-term success but undermine lasting peace. Ultimately the authors show how the stronger side can almost always win the villages, but why that does not guarantee winning the war.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Go ahead, be skeptical about big data. The author was-at first. When the term \"big data\" first came on the scene, bestselling author Tom Davenport (Competing on Analytics, Analytics at Work) thought it was just another example of technology hype. But his research in the years that followed changed his mind. Now, in clear, conversational language, Davenport explains what big data means-and why everyone in business needs to know about it. Big Data at Work covers all the bases: what big data means from a technical, consumer, and management perspective; what its opportunities and costs are; where it can have real business impact; and which aspects of this hot topic have been oversold. This book will help you understand: Why big data is important to you and your organization; What technology you need to manage it; How big data could change your job, your company, and your industry; How to hire, rent, or develop the kinds of people who make big data work; The key success factors in implementing any big data project; How big data is leading to a new approach to managing analytics. With dozens of company examples, including UPS, GE, Amazon, United Healthcare, Citigroup, and many others, this book will help you seize all opportunities-from improving decisions, products, and services to strengthening customer relationships. It will show you how to put big data to work in your own organization so that you too can harness the power of this ever-evolving new resource.</p></span>",

Languages such as R, Python, Java, and so on are mostly used for data science. It is particularly good at analyzing large sets of data without any significant impact on performance and thus Scala is being adopted by many developers and data scientists. Data scientists might be aware that building applications that are truly scalable is hard. Scala, with its powerful functional libraries for interacting with databases and building scalable frameworks will give you the tools to construct robust data pipelines.</p><p>This book will introduce you to the libraries for ingesting, storing, manipulating, processing, and visualizing data in Scala.</p><p>Packed with real-world examples and interesting data sets, this book will teach you to ingest data from flat files and web APIs and store it in a SQL or NoSQL database. It will show you how to design scalable architectures to process and modelling your data, starting from simple concurrency constructs such as parallel collections and futures, through to actor systems and Apache Spark. As well as Scala's emphasis on functional structures and immutability, you will learn how to use the right parallel construct for the job at hand, minimizing development time without compromising scalability. Finally, you will learn how to build beautiful interactive visualizations using web frameworks.</p><p>This book gives tutorials on some of the most common Scala libraries for data science, allowing you to quickly get up to speed with building data science and data engineering solutions.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>A tutorial with complete examples, this book will give you the tools to start building useful data engineering and data science solutions straightaway</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><span><span><p><em>Theoretical Foundations of Functional Data Analysis, with an Introduction to Linear Operators</em> provides a uniquely broad compendium of the key mathematical concepts and results that are relevant for the theoretical development of functional data analysis (FDA).</p><p>The self-contained treatment of selected topics of functional analysis and operator theory includes reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, singular value decomposition of compact operators on Hilbert spaces and perturbation theory for both self-adjoint and non self-adjoint operators. The probabilistic foundation for FDA is described from the perspective of random elements in Hilbert spaces as well as from the viewpoint of continuous time stochastic processes. Nonparametric estimation approaches including kernel and regularized smoothing are also introduced. These tools are then used to investigate the properties of estimators for the mean element, covariance operators, principal components, regression function and canonical correlations. A general treatment of canonical correlations in Hilbert spaces naturally leads to FDA formulations of factor analysis, regression, MANOVA and discriminant analysis.</p><p>This book will provide a valuable reference for statisticians and other researchers interested in developing or understanding the mathematical aspects of FDA. It is also suitable for a graduate level special topics course.</p></span></span></span></span></span>",

It looks at how unfair and deceptive trade practice laws apply to big data. It identifies some laws that often surprise organizations: federal statutes like the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Child’s Online Privacy Protection Act, and others that trigger when working with big data. And it explains the ways data practices are reviewed by the Federal Trade Commission, State Attorneys General, private litigants, and various global legal entities.</p><ul><li>Explore the legal landscape and core obligations associated with big data practices</li><li>Discover the surprising range of federal statutes that pertain to big data</li><li>Build your awareness of the legal frameworks that govern data privacy and security</li><li>Pick up some practical strategies that help businesses avoid becoming legal targets</li></ul><p>Alysa Z.

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>\n                Causal questions are ubiquitous in data science. For example, you may have questions that are deeply rooted in causality, such as whether or not changing a feature on a website led to more traffic or if digital ad exposure led to incremental purchase, did changing a feature in a website lead to more traffic or if digital ad exposure led to incremental purchase.\n            </p><p>\n                Randomized tests are considered to be the gold standard when addressing causal effects; however, in many cases experiments are unfeasible or unethical. In such cases, you have to rely on observational (nonexperimental) data to derive causal insights. The crucial difference between randomized experiments and observational data is that in the former, test subjects (e.g., the customers) are randomly assigned a treatment (e.g., digital advertisement exposure). This helps curb the possibility that user response (e.g., clicking on a link in the ad and purchasing the product) across the two groups of treated and nontreated subjects is different because of preexisting differences in user characteristic (e.g., demographics, geolocation, etc.) In essence, you can then attribute divergences observed posttreatment in key outcomes (e.g., purchase rate) as the causal impact of the treatment. But this treatment assignment mechanism is absent when using observational data.\n            </p><p>\n                Subhasish Misra (Walmart Labs) explores the statistical methods available to ensure you’re able to circumvent this shortcoming and get to causality. You’ll get a practical overview of the aspects of causal inference, including the fundamental tenants of causality and measuring causal effects; the challenges involved in measuring causal effects in real-world situations; distinguishing between randomized and observational measurement approaches; an introduction to measuring casual effects with observational data using matching and its extension of propensity score-based matching with a focus on the institution and statistics behind it, tips from the trenches based on Subhasish’s experience with these techniques; and practical limitations of these approaches. Subhashish walks you through an example of how matching was applied to get causal insights regarding the effectiveness of a digital product at Walmart.\n            </p><p><b>Prerequisite knowledge</b></p><ul><li>\n                    A basic understanding of machine statistics and data science\n                </li></ul><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><ul><li>\n                    Discover the fundamental nuances of causal inference and analytical frameworks and implementation tools to tease out causal effects in the wild—when randomization isn't an option\n                </li><li>\n                    Understand the differences between randomized and observational studies and the challenges in getting to causal conclusions for each\n                </li></ul><p>\n                This session is from the 2019 O'Reilly Strata Conference in New York, NY.\n            </p></div></span></span>",

It is not that there is a lack of quality improvement models, as there are many available. While each has had success, no one model that taken hold as the model. Why do improvement efforts seem to fizzle out? Why are they not sustainable?</p><p>Something has been missing from the strategy, planning, and implementation of these quality efforts. That missing ingredient has been culture. This book provides the strategy, tools, and methods needed for sustainable quality. The book is based on a new quality model and explains why a positive culture is a prerequisite to sustainable quality improvement.</p><p>Excellence is achieved through people, and it is this people-centric approach that should be the basis for success.

    "description": "<span><p>We've all heard that a picture is worth a thousand words, but what if we don't understand what we're looking at? Social media has made charts, infographics, and diagrams ubiquitous-and easier to share than ever. We associate charts with science and reason; the flashy visuals are both appealing and persuasive. Pie charts, maps, bar and line graphs, and scatter plots (to name a few) can better inform us, revealing patterns and trends hidden behind the numbers we encounter in our lives. In short, good charts make us smarter-if we know how to read them.</p>\n\n<p>However, they can also lead us astray. Charts lie in a variety of ways-displaying incomplete or inaccurate data, suggesting misleading patterns, and concealing uncertainty-or are frequently misunderstood, such as the confusing cone of uncertainty maps shown on TV every hurricane season. To make matters worse, many of us are ill-equipped to interpret the visuals that politicians, journalists, advertisers, and even our employers present each day, enabling bad actors to easily manipulate them to promote their own agendas.</p>\n\n<p>In How Charts Lie, data visualization expert Alberto Cairo teaches us to not only spot the lies in deceptive visuals, but also to take advantage of good ones to understand complex stories.</p>\n\n<p></p></span>",

Instead of spending time on HOW to install specific packages, it focuses on the reasons WHY readers would install a given package.<br/><br/>The book provides authoritative guidance on a range of tools, including open source and proprietary systems. It details the strengths and weaknesses of incorporating big data analysis into decision-making and explains how to leverage the strengths while mitigating the weaknesses.</p><ul><li>Describes the benefits of distributed computing in simple terms</li><li>Includes substantial vendor/tool material, especially for open source decisions</li><li>Covers prominent software packages, including Hadoop and Oracle Endeca</li><li>Examines GIS and machine learning applications</li><li>Considers privacy and surveillance issues </li><p/></ul><p>The book further explores basic statistical concepts that, when misapplied, can be the source of errors. Time and again, big data is treated as an oracle that discovers results nobody would have imagined. While big data can serve this valuable function, all too often these results are incorrect, yet are still reported unquestioningly. The probability of having erroneous results increases as a larger number of variables are compared unless preventative measures are taken.<br/><br/>The approach taken by the authors is to explain these concepts so managers can ask better questions of their analysts and vendors as to the appropriateness of the methods used to arrive at a conclusion. Because the world of science and medicine has been grappling with similar issues in the publication of studies, the authors draw on their efforts and apply them to big data.</p></span></span>",

Data Center Storage: Cost-Effective Strategies, Implementation, and Management provides an industry insider's insight on how to properly scope, plan, evaluate, and implement storage technologies to maximize performance, capacity, reliability, and power savings. It provides business and use-case focused coverage of storage technology, including storage area networks (SAN), capacity-optimized drives, and solid-state drives. It offers key insights on financially responsible spending for data center storage. Delivered in accessible language, the book starts with a discussion of the business merits of replacing direct attached, compartmentalized storage with consolidated SAN-attached storage. The author advises on the use of service level applications (SLAs) as a tool to drive business unit collaboration with IT and prioritize those actions that impact productivity and profit from those that are less critical. This business guide to applied technologies disassembles big problems into digestible segments to help you understand, quantify, and fix any problems that arise as you work towards meeting your growing storage needs. The book builds on the consolidation and SLA driven approach to take advantage of the compelling benefits and potential savings of managed hosting and cloud storage.</p></span>",

Firmware represents the boundary between hardware and software, and given its persistence, mutability, and opaqueness to today’s antivirus scanning technology, it represents an interesting target for attackers.<p>As platforms are universally network-connected and can contain multiple devices with firmware, and a global supply chain feeds into platform firmware, assurance is critical for consumers, IT enterprises, and governments. This importance is highlighted by emergent requirements such as NIST SP800-193 for firmware resilience and NIST SP800-155 for firmware measurement.</p>\n<p>This book covers the secure implementation of various aspects of firmware, including standards-based firmware—such as support of the Trusted Computing Group (TCG), Desktop Management Task Force (DMTF), and Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) specifications—and also provides code samples and use cases. Beyond the standards, alternate firmware implementations such as ARM Trusted Firmware and other device firmware implementations (such as platform roots of trust), are covered.</p>\n<p><br/></p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p>\n<p></p><ul><li>Get an overview of proactive security development for firmware, including firmware threat modeling</li><li>Understand the details of architecture, including protection, detection, recovery, integrity measurement, and access control</li><li>Be familiar with best practices for secure firmware development, including trusted execution environments, cryptography, and language-based defenses</li><li>Know the techniques used for security validation and maintenance</li></ul><b><div><b><br/></b></div>Who This Book Is For</b><div><b><br/></b></div><div>Given the complexity of modern platform boot requirements and the threat landscape, this book is relevant for readers spanning from IT decision makers to developers building firmware<b><br/></b></div></div></span>",
