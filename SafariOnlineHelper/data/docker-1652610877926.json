No prior experience with Docker Containers is required.</p><b>What You Will Learn</b><ul><li>Containerize your traditional or microservice-based application</li><li>Share or ship your application as an immutable container image</li><li>Build a Docker swarm and a Kubernetes cluster in the cloud</li><li>Run a highly distributed application using Docker Swarm or Kubernetes</li><li>Update or rollback a distributed application with zero downtime</li><li>Secure your applications via encapsulation, networks, and secrets</li><li>Know your options when deploying your containerized app into the cloud</li></ul><b>In Detail</b><p>Docker containers have revolutionized the software supply chain in small and big enterprises. Never before has a new technology so rapidly penetrated the top 500 enterprises worldwide. Companies that embrace containers and containerize their traditional mission-critical applications have reported savings of at least 50% in total maintenance cost and a reduction of 90% (or more) of the time required to deploy new versions of those applications. Furthermore they are benefitting from increased security just by using containers as opposed to running applications outside containers.</p><p>This book starts from scratch, introducing you to Docker fundamentals and setting up an environment to work with it. Then we delve into concepts such as Docker containers, Docker images, Docker Compose, and so on. We will also cover the concepts of deployment, orchestration, networking, and security. Furthermore, we explain Docker functionalities on public clouds such as AWS.</p><p>By the end of this book, you will have hands-on experience working with Docker containers and orchestrators such as SwarmKit and Kubernetes.</p><b>Style and approach</b><p>The simple end-to-end guide will help you learn everything about how to containerize, ship, and run both a traditional application and a modern microservice-based application on-premise or in the cloud.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book You can download the example code files for all Packt books you have purchased from your account at http://www.PacktPub.com.

With over 2 hours of hands-on, practical video lessons, you'll learn the ins and outs of Docker and discover how to apply what you've learned to your own day-to-day development. Starting with an overview of Docker, you'll dive into the commands and techniques you'll need for running and managing containers, creating, modifying, saving and uploading Docker images from scratch, running and building multiple containers with Docker Compose, and more.</p>\nInside:\n<ul><li>An introduction to Docker and how it works\n</li><li>Image management\n</li><li>Creating Docker images\n</li><li>Managing containers\n</li><li>Storing and managing data in volumes\n</li><li>Linking your Docker containers\n</li><li>Running a web server which is connected to a database\n</li><li>Configuring containers using docker-compose\n</li></ul>\nAbout the subject<p>\nDocker creates sandboxed environments, called containers, that isolate your applications from the underlying infrastructure, making them much easier to deploy, migrate, scale, and remove. Each Docker container includes the application and all its dependencies in a single deployable package. Docker has rapidly become a nearly universal part of IT infrastructure in millions of Linux and cloud-based deployments worldwide, including big shops like eBay and Lyft. It's time to join them! \n</p>\nPrerequisites<br/>\nNo experience with Docker is required. The course assumes basic familiarity with Linux and software development.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Peter Fisher</b> is a freelance web and mobile app developer.

He helped create the Kubernetes-AWS-Docker microservices environment at Gridium and has worked in software engineering for twelve years. He holds an MSE in Software Engineering from Portland State University, a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from Oregon State University, and is the author or co-author of the O'Reilly titles Porting from Python 2 to Python 3 and Building Tools with GitHub, and the co-author of the second edition of Pro Git.</div></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p><strong>Nearly 3 Hours of Video Instruction\n </strong></p><p><em>Docker Orchestration and Microservices LiveLessons</em> provides developers with key insights and best practices for how to develop and orchestrate containerized microservices.</p><p><strong>Description</strong></p><p>In this video training, Charlie Crawford starts by introducing some of the motivations behind microservices and how to properly containerize web applications using Docker. He then does a quick overview of how Docker registries can help to store artifacts from your built images. Following this, he walks you through Docker's latest tools: docker-compose, docker-machine, and docker-swarm. Specifically, Charlie covers how to use these tools to aid in both developing and deploying to a wide variety of system and container configurations. He then turns to Kubernetes, the popular container orchestration system created by Google. After watching this video, developers will have a strong understanding of modern containerized applications and microservices and will understand how these systems can benefit them.</p><p><strong>Related Files</strong></p><p>The supplemental content for this LiveLesson can be downloaded from <a href=\"https://github.com/CADBOT/docker-livelessons-notes\" target=\"blank\">https://github.com/CADBOT/docker-livelessons-notes</a>.</p><p><strong>About the Instructor</strong></p><p><strong>Charles Crawford III</strong> has more than ten years of software experience and five years of experience in software education.

Also discussed is how Docker fits into microservices and how it can be a great help in developing microservice-based systems.</p><p><strong>Lesson 2: Dockering Your Microservices<br/></strong>Lesson 2, ‚ÄúDockerizing your Microservices,‚Äù looks at creating a basic microservice using Node.js. Next, this lesson covers how to create a Docker image containing the microservice and its dependencies.</p><p><strong>Lesson 3: Using Registries to Store and Distribute Docker<br/></strong>Lesson 3, ‚ÄúUsing Registries to Store and Distribute Docker,‚Äù looks at using the Docker Hub service as a repository to store your custom docker images. Additionally covered is how to trigger automatic rebuilds of Docker images upon a code push to Github.</p><p><strong>Lesson 4: Deploying Single Instance Single Container Apps with Docker Machine<br/></strong>Lesson 4, ‚ÄúDeploying Single Instance Single Container Apps with Docker Machine,‚Äù covers doing basic dockerized app deployments using Docker Machine. This sets the foundation for work in future lessons with Docker Compose and Docker swarm.</p><p><strong>Lesson 5: Local Development of Microservices-Based Apps with Docker Compose<br/></strong>Lesson 5, ‚ÄúLocal Development of Microservices-Based Apps with Docker Compose,‚Äù explores how Docker is not only useful in a production environment, but a development one as well. One of the largest challenges of microservices is the more complex setup required for a development environment; however, Docker Compose makes local development easier than ever.</p><p><strong>Lesson 6: Deploying Single Instance Multi-Container Apps with Docker Compose and Docker Machine<br/></strong>Lesson 6, ‚ÄúDeploying Single Instance Multi-Container Apps with Docker Compose and Docker Machine,‚Äù is about extending Docker Compose beyond development environments to do multi-container apps on a single instance, quickly and easily.</p><p><strong>Lesson 7: Multi-Instance Multi-Container Applications with Docker Swarm<br/></strong>Lesson 7, ‚ÄúMulti-Instance Multi-Container Applications with Docker Swarm,‚Äù is where we take our first look at complex multi-instance and multi-container deployments. Docker Swarm is built on the Docker API, so a lot of knowledge carries over from vanilla Docker, but there are still additional swarm constructs to learn, such as the master and slave node systems.</p><p><strong>Lesson 8: Advanced Docker Swarm Configuration<br/></strong>Lesson 8, ‚ÄúAdvanced Docker Swarm Configuration,‚Äù takes a deeper look into Docker Swarm and teaches you about advanced configuration options such as container affinities.</p><p><strong>Lesson 9: Container Orchestration with Kubernetes<br/></strong>Lesson 9, ‚ÄúContainer Orchestration with Kubernetes,‚Äù looks at Kubernetes, which takes a different approach to orchestration than Swarm. Kubernetes brings in many new concepts such as pods, replication controllers, services, and more.</p><p><strong>About LiveLessons Video Training<br/></strong><br/>\n The LiveLessons Video Training series publishes hundreds of hands-on, expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

These hands-on lessons help you explore Docker\ncontainers, registries and run-time environments.</p><p>¬†</p><p><b>Description</b></p><p>¬†</p><p>With cloud computing, applications need to move around\nefficiently and run almost anywhere. In this video, learn how you\ncan create containerized applications with Docker that are\nlight-weight and portable. First, Chris shows you how to begin\nusing Docker on Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, or Fedora systems\n(with options of Windows or Mac OS X). Then he shows how to pull\nand push Docker container images from and to Docker registries. The\nnext few lessons get you started running and investigating how\ncontainers work.¬† After that, the video shows you how to build\nyour own Docker images. The video then touches on orchestration\ntools such as Kubernetes and GearD for deploying containers. And\nfinally, it provides some tips for developing your own Docker\ncontainers.</p><p>¬†</p><p>¬†</p><p><b>About the Instructor</b></p><p>¬†</p><p><b>Christopher Negus</b>¬†is a certified RHCE instructor and\nprincipal technical writer for Red Hat, Inc.

Having impeccable knowledge of Docker will help you to thrive in the modern cloud-first world. With this book, you'll gain the skills you need to work with Docker and its containers.</p><p>The book begins with an introduction to containers and explains its functionality and application in the real world. You'll then get an overview of VMware, Kubernetes, and Docker and learn to install Docker on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Once you've understood the Ops and Dev perspective of Docker, you'll be able to see the big picture and understand what Docker exactly does. The book then turns its attention to the more technical aspects, guiding your through practical exercises covering Docker engine, Docker images, and Docker containers.

In this video, learn how you can create containerized applications with Docker that are lightweight and portable. First, Chris Negus shows you how to begin using Docker on Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, or Fedora systems (with options of Windows or Mac OS X). Then he shows you how to pull and push Docker container images from and to Docker registries. The next few lessons get you started running containers and investigating how they work. After that, you learn how to build your own Docker images. The video then examines orchestration tools, such as Kubernetes and Cockpit, and development tools, such as OpenShift, for deploying and managing containers. Finally, it provides some tips for developing your own Docker containers.</p><p><strong>About the Instructor</strong></p><p><strong>Chris Negus</strong> has authored or co-authored dozens of books on Linux and UNIX, including the <em>Red Hat Linux Bible</em> (all editions), <em>Linux Troubleshooting Bible</em>, <em>Linux Bible</em> (now in its 9th edition), <em>Linux Toolbox</em> series, <em>Linux Toys</em>, <em>Linux Toys II</em>, and mostly recently, <em>Docker Containers</em>. Currently, Chris works for Red Hat, Inc., where he is a Red Hat Certified Architect (RHCA), Red Hat Certified Instructor and Examiner, and Principal Technical Writer. Early in his career, Chris worked for eight years with the organization at AT&amp;T that developed the UNIX operating system.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Skill Level</strong><br/>\n</p><ul><li>Beginner to advanced</li></ul><strong>Learn How To</strong><br/><ul><li>Run, stop, and restart Docker containers</li><li>Install Docker on standard Linux or specialized container operating systems</li><li>Set up a private OpenShift installation on Windows, Mac, or Linux with minishift</li><li>Set up a private Docker Registry or use OpenShift Registry</li><li>Create, run, and investigate Docker images and containers</li><li>Pull and push containers between local systems and Docker registries</li><li>Integrate Docker containers with host networking and storage</li><li>Orchestrate multiple containers into complex applications with Kubernetes</li><li>Build a Docker container to simplify application deployment</li><li>Launch a containerized application in OpenShift</li><li>Employ best practices when developing containerized applications</li><li>Create interesting and powerful containers</li><li>Investigate Docker supporting technology that is on the horizon</li></ul><strong>Who Should Take This Course</strong><br/><ul><li>System administrators who need to create, deploy, and manage Docker containers</li><li>Application developers who want to understand which applications are most appropriate for containerization and what are best practices for adapting their applications to containers</li></ul><strong>Course Requirements</strong><br/><ul><li>A basic understanding of running commands in Linux</li><li>Familiarity with Linux concepts such as networking, software repos, and storage</li><li>Familiarity with concepts related to deploying applications</li></ul><strong>Lesson Descriptions</strong><br/><br/><strong>Lesson 1: Welcome to Docker Containers and Beyond</strong><br/>\nIn Lesson 1, you learn the benefits of running applications in Docker containers. You also learn where Docker came from, the components that make up Docker, and other initiatives that have grown up around the Docker project.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 2: Getting Docker Software</strong><br/>\nIn Lesson 2, you learn how to get Docker software and start it on the operating system that you choose. It includes procedures for installing Docker on Fedora, Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux distributions, as well as the lightweight Project Atomic operating system. It also describes how to install an OpenShift cluster on your Linux, Windows, or Mac system, to have a container development/deployment setup on your laptop or desktop.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 3: Using Docker Registries</strong><br/>\nIn Lesson 3, you start using Docker registries. Docker registries are places where container images are stored. There is a public Docker registry available (referred to as the Docker Index or Hub), but you can also set up private registries to store your own containers. You can also explore the private container registry that comes with OpenShift.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 4: Starting Up Containers</strong><br/>\nIn Lesson 4, you start running containers on your Linux system. Once a container is running, you can explore your container in different ways, and then start and stop the containers as needed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 5: Making Docker Images from Containers</strong><br/>\nIn Lesson 5, you take containers you have made by running commands on your local system and save them as images you can transport. Once you have transported your new Docker image to another system running Docker, you can load the image and run it on that system. Or you can push your new image to the Docker Hub or to a private registry.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 6: Keeping Your Docker Build System Healthy</strong><br/>\nIn Lesson 6, you learn ways to query the state of your Docker system and ways to keep it healthy, such as removing containers and images left on your system that you no longer need.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 7: Building Docker Images</strong><br/>\nIn Lesson 7, you learn how to build a Docker container image that includes everything needed to run an application.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 8: Tips for Building Containers</strong><br/>\nIn Lesson 8, you learn some simple rules to get better results from the containers you run, build, and manage. In particular, working with software repositories, networking, and storage are given extra attention in this lesson. How to choose a useful base image or builder image as the foundation of your images is also covered.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 9: Orchestrating with Kubernetes and OpenShift</strong><br/>\nLesson 9 introduces you to the concept of container orchestration‚Äö√Ñ√Æhow to manage multiple containers in pods using replication controllers and services in Kubernetes. This includes a demonstration of an all-in-one Kubernetes master and node as well as an example of how to investigate a Kubernetes cluster. After that, you explore the Cockpit Web-based interface for managing containers.<br/>\n<strong><br/>\nLesson 10: Developing Containerized Applications</strong><br/>\nLesson 10 describes applications you should keep an eye on that are currently in development for deploying containerized applications.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 11: Digging into Advanced Networking and Storage</strong><br/>\nLesson 11 starts with descriptions for setting up default networking for your Docker systems, as well as how to change networking for individual containers. After that, it tells how containers can use storage from the host computer by mounting volumes and how to share storage volumes among containers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 12: Running Super Privileged Containers</strong><br/>\nIn Lesson 12, you learn about how Docker relies on the Linux Container feature (LXC) to separate containers from the Linux host. Building on that knowledge, you learn how to open containers to individual name spaces on the host or open containers completely to the host using what are referred to as super privileged containers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 13: Going Further with Docker</strong><br/>\nIn Lesson 13, you learn advanced security techniques and examine interesting Dockerfile files to see how others build containers. Next, you see commands such as atomic, runc, buildah, and skopeo to work with containers without the Docker service.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>About Pearson Video Training</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nPearson publishes expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

Crawford starts by introducing some of the motivations behind microservices and how to properly containerize web applications using Docker. He then does a quick overview of how Docker registries can help to store artifacts from your built images. Following this, he walks you through Docker's latest tools: docker-compose, docker-machine, and docker-swarm. Specifically, Charlie covers how to use these tools to aid in both developing and deploying to a wide variety of system and container configurations. He then turns to Kubernetes, the popular container orchestration system created by Google. After watching this video, developers will have a strong understanding of modern containerized applications and microservices and will understand how these systems can benefit them.</p><p><strong>About the Instructor</strong></p><p>Charles David Crawford has more than ten years of software experience and five years of experience in software education. He is currently a lead instructor at Code Fellows, where he teaches full-stack web programming. He is also an active software and writing consultant and the director of marketing for Hack The People, a distributed nonprofit organization focused on fostering mentor-mentee relationships in software development. Additionally, Charlie is an active blog contributor at The New Stack, a site featuring news about and analysis of an ever-changing software development ecosystem. Prior to this, Charlie was a developer evangelist for Shippable, a SaaS that leverages Docker to provide continuous integration services. He was also a software engineer at Amazon Web Services on the Elastic Beanstalk team, where he worked on things such as the Elastic Beanstalk Ruby container, Nodejs container, and the Docker container.</p><p><strong>Skill Level</strong></p><ul><li>Intermediate</li></ul><p><strong>Learn How To</strong></p><ul><li>Begin designing your web apps as microservices</li><li>Use Docker to containerize your microservices</li><li>Leverage modern Docker orchestration tools to aid in both developing and deploying your applications</li><li>Use Google‚Äôs container orchestration platform Kubernetes</li><li>Interpret the modern DevOps and container orchestration landscape</li></ul><p><strong>Who Should Take This Course</strong></p><ul><li>Users of Docker who are looking to move from ad-hoc setups to more formal and powerful orchestrated setups.</li><li>Those interested in microservice-based architectures</li></ul><p><strong>Course Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Basic understanding of Docker</li><li>Understanding of web services</li><li>A programming background</li></ul><p><strong>Related Files</strong></p><p>The supplemental content for this LiveLesson can be downloaded from https://github.com/CADBOT/docker-livelessons-notes.</p><p><strong>Lesson Descriptions</strong></p><p><strong>Lesson 1: Thinking in Terms of Microservices</strong></p><p>Lesson 1 covers the basics of what a microservice is, what problems it solves, and new challenges microservices bring. Also discussed is how Docker fits into microservices and how it can be a great help in developing microservice-based systems.</p><p><strong>Lesson 2: Dockerizing Your Microservices</strong></p><p>Lesson 2 looks at creating a basic microservice using Node.js. Next, this lesson covers how to create a Docker image containing the microservice and its dependencies.</p><p><strong>Lesson 3: Using Registries to Store and Distribute Docker</strong></p><p>Lesson 3 looks at using the Docker Hub service as a repository to store your custom docker images. Additionally covered is how to trigger automatic rebuilds of Docker images upon a code push to Github.</p><p><strong>Lesson 4: Deploying Single Instance Single Container Apps with Docker Machine</strong></p><p>Lesson 4 covers doing basic dockerized app deployments using Docker Machine. This sets the foundation for work in future lessons with Docker Compose and Docker swarm.</p><p><strong>Lesson 5: Local Development of Microservices-Based Apps with Docker Compose</strong></p><p>Lesson 5 explores how Docker is not only useful in a production environment, but a development one as well. One of the largest challenges of microservices is the more complex setup required for a development environment; however, Docker Compose makes local development easier than ever.</p><p><strong>Lesson 6: Deploying Single Instance Multi-Container Apps with Docker Compose and Docker Machine</strong></p><p>Lesson 6 is about extending Docker Compose beyond development environments to do multi-container apps on a single instance, quickly and easily.</p><p><strong>Lesson 7: Multi¬¨‚â†Instance Multi-Container Applications with Docker Swarm, Stack, and Compose</strong></p><p>Lesson 7 is where we take our first look at complex multi-instance and multi-container deployments. Docker Swarm is built on the Docker API, so a lot of knowledge carries over from vanilla Docker, but there are still additional swarm constructs to learn, such as the master and slave node systems.</p><p><strong>Lesson 8: Advanced Docker Swarm Configuration</strong></p><p>Lesson 8 takes a deeper look into Docker Swarm and teaches you about advanced configuration options such as container affinities.</p><p><strong>Lesson 9: Container Orchestration with Kubernetes</strong></p><p>Lesson 9 looks at Kubernetes, which takes a different approach to orchestration than Swarm. Kubernetes brings in many new concepts such as pods, replication controllers, services, and more.</p><p><strong>About Pearson Video Training</strong></p><p>Pearson publishes expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

    "description": "Docker Community Edition‚Äîan open source product that lets you build, ship, and run containers‚Äîis an assembly of modular components built from an upstream open source project called Moby. Moby provides a ‚ÄúLego set‚Äù of dozens of components, the framework for assembling them into specialized container-based systems, and a place for all container enthusiasts to experiment and exchange ideas.\n\nPatrick Chanezon and Mindy Preston explain how you can leverage the Moby project to assemble your own specialized container-based system, whether for IoT, cloud, or bare-metal scenarios. Patrick and Mindy explore Moby‚Äôs framework, components, and tooling, focusing on two components: LinuxKit, a toolkit to build container-based Linux subsystems that are secure, lean, and portable, and InfraKit, a toolkit for creating and managing declarative, self-healing infrastructure. Along the way, they demo how to use Moby, LinuxKit, InfraKit, and other components to quickly assemble full-blown container-based systems for several use cases and deploy them on various infrastructures.",

They need have no knowledge of Docker and Kubernetes.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Package Java applications into Docker images</li><li>Understand the running of containers locally</li><li>Explore development and deployment options with Docker</li><li>Integrate Docker into Maven builds</li><li>Manage and monitor Java applications running on Kubernetes clusters</li><li>Create Continuous Delivery pipelines for Java applications deployed to Kubernetes</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Imagine creating and testing Java EE applications on Apache Tomcat Server or Wildfly Application server in minutes along with deploying and managing Java applications swiftly. Sounds too good to be true? But you have a reason to cheer as such scenarios are only possible by leveraging Docker and Kubernetes.</p><p>This book will start by introducing Docker and delve deep into its networking and persistent storage concepts. You will then proceed to learn how to refactor monolith application into separate services by building an application and then packaging it into Docker containers. Next, you will create an image containing Java Enterprise Application and later run it using Docker. Moving on, the book will focus on Kubernetes and its features and you will learn to deploy a Java application to Kubernetes using Maven and monitor a Java application in production. By the end of the book, you will get hands-on with some more advanced topics to further extend your knowledge about Docker and Kubernetes.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>An easy-to-follow, practical guide that will help Java developers develop, deploy, and manage Java applications efficiently.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book. You can download the example code files for all Packt books you have purchased from your account at http://www.PacktPub.com.

In this course, you'll start by installing Docker on your computer - macOS, Windows, or Linux. Afterward, you'll jump into tons of practice activities and use different Docker features. You'll pull different Docker images and run multiple containers using them.</p><p>In practice sections, you'll perform multiple practice Docker activities, such as running Docker containers in the foreground and background, then connecting to certain processes in Docker from the terminal. After that, you'll learn to expose internal container ports to the outside and add environment variables for containers. You'll also create custom names and hostnames for containers, create a custom bridge network and run multiple containers inside of it, communicate between containers, and persist container folders using volumes mapping.</p><p>Next, you'll also learn and practice how to use different Docker images (view and edit them). For that, you will not use the terminal; instead, you'll use the GUI application Visual Studio Code.</p><p>By the end of this course, you'll gain fundamental practical knowledge of Docker and be able to easily use it for the development and testing of your applications.</p><p>Most importantly, you'll understand Docker's main features such as Docker Volumes, Docker networking, and environment variables.</p><p><b>Audience</b></p><p>This course is for anyone who is interested in learning about Docker and its components via practical projects.

You can run Docker on Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10, and run your existing apps in containers to get significant improvements in efficiency, security, and portability.</p><p>This book teaches you all you need to know about Docker on Windows, from 101 to deploying highly-available workloads in production. This book takes you on a Docker journey, starting with the key concepts and simple examples of how to run .NET Framework and .NET Core apps in Windows Docker containers. Then it moves on to more complex examples‚Äîusing Docker to modernize the architecture and development of traditional ASP.NET and SQL Server apps.</p><p>The examples show you how to break up monoliths into distributed apps and deploy them to a clustered environment in the cloud, using the exact same artifacts you use to run them locally. To help you move confidently to production, it then explains Docker security, and the management and support options.</p><p>The book finishes with guidance on getting started with Docker in your own projects, together with some real-world case studies for Docker implementations, from small-scale on-premises apps to very large-scale apps running on Azure.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>Using a step-by-step approach, this book shows you how to use Docker on Windows. It includes practical examples and real-world technical and business scenarios that will help you effectively implement Docker in your environment.There are over 50 examples of Dockerized applications, using C# .NET projects as the source and packaging them into Docker images.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book.

We're going to do that by first introducing you to the basics of Docker and its components. Then we'll start to use Docker to build containers and services to perform a variety of tasks.</p><p>We're going to take you through the development lifecycle, from testing to production, and see where Docker fits in and how it can make your life easier. We'll make use of Docker to build test environments for new projects, demonstrate how to integrate Docker with continuous integration workflow, and then how to build application services and platforms. Finally, we'll show you how to use Docker's API and how to extend Docker yourself.</p><p>We'll teach you how to:</p><p>* Install Docker.<br/>\n* Take your first steps with a Docker container.<br/>\n* Build Docker images.<br/>\n* Manage and share Docker images.<br/>\n* Run and manage more complex Docker containers.<br/>\n* Deploy Docker containers as part of your testing pipeline.<br/>\n* Build multi-container applications and environments.<br/>\n* Learn about orchestration. Use Compose and Swarm for the orchestration of Docker containers and Consul for service discovery.<br/>\n* Explore the Docker API.<br/>\n* Getting Help and Extending Docker.</p></span>",

    "title": "Deploying Machine Learning Models as Microservices Using Docker",
    "description": "<span><span><span><div><p>Modern applications running in the cloud often rely on REST-based microservices architectures by using Docker containers. Docker enables your applications to communicate between one another and to compose and scale various components. Data scientists use these techniques to efficiently scale their machine learning models to production applications. This video teaches you how to deploy machine learning models behind a REST API‚Äîto serve low latency requests from applications‚Äîwithout using a Spark cluster. In the process, you'll learn how to export models trained in SparkML; how to work with Docker, a convenient way to build, deploy, and ship application code for microservices; and how a model scoring service should support single on-demand predictions and bulk predictions. Learners should have basic familiarity with the following: Scala or Python; Hadoop, Spark, or Pandas; SBT or Maven; cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services; Bash, Docker, and REST.</p><ul><li>Understand how to deploy machine learning models behind a REST API</li><li>Learn to utilize Docker containers for REST-based microservices architectures</li><li>Explore methods for exporting models trained in SparkML using a library like Combust MLeap</li><li>See how Docker builds, deploys, and ships application code for microservices</li><li>Discover how to deploy a model using exported PMML with a REST API in a Docker container</li><li>Learn to use the AWS elastic container service to deploy a model hosting server in Docker</li><li>Pick up techniques that enable a model hosting server to read a model</li></ul><p>Mikhail Semeniuk is a data engineer with Shift Technologies.

    "description": "<span><div><p>Docker does for DevOps what Rails did for web development--it gives you a new set of superpowers. Gone are \"works on my machine\" woes and lengthy setup tasks, replaced instead by a simple, consistent, Docker-based development environment that will have your team up and running in seconds. Gain hands-on, real-world experience with a tool that's rapidly becoming fundamental to software development. Go from zero all the way to production as Docker transforms the massive leap of deploying your app in the cloud into a baby step.</p><p>Docker makes life as a Ruby and Rails developer easier. It helps build, ship, and run your applications, solving major problems you face every day. It allows you to run applications at scale, adding new resources as needed. Docker provides a reliable, consistent environment that's guaranteed to work the same everywhere.</p><p>Docker lets you do all things DevOps without needing a PhD in infrastructure and operations. Want to spin up a cluster to run your app? No problem. Scale it up or down at will? You bet. Start by running a Ruby script without having Ruby installed on the local machine. Then Dockerize a Rails application and run it using containers, including creating your own custom Docker images tailored for running Rails apps. Describe your app declaratively using Docker Compose, specifying the software dependencies along with everything needed to run the application. Then set up continuous integration, as well as your deployment pipeline and infrastructure. Along the way, find out the best practices for using Docker in development and production environments.</p><p>This book gives you a solid foundation on using Docker and fitting it into your development workflow and deployment process. </p><p><br/><br/></p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p>All you need is a Windows, Mac OS X or Linux machine to do development on. This book guides you through the process of installing Docker. Some basic familiarity with Linux/Unix is recommended even if you're using a Windows machine.</div></span>",

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a leader in public cloud computing, and was the first to offer a managed container platform in the form of the Elastic Container Service (ECS).\n</p><p>Docker on Amazon Web Services starts with the basics of containers, Docker, and AWS, before teaching you how to install Docker on your local machine and establish access to your AWS account. You'll then dig deeper into the ECS, a native container management platform provided by AWS that simplifies management and operation of your Docker clusters and applications for no additional cost. Once you have got to grips with the basics, you'll solve key operational challenges, including secrets management and auto-scaling your infrastructure and applications. You'll explore alternative strategies for deploying and running your Docker applications on AWS, including Fargate and ECS Service Discovery, Elastic Beanstalk, Docker Swarm and Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). In addition to this, there will be a strong focus on adopting an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach using AWS CloudFormation.\n</p><p>By the end of this book, you'll not only understand how to run Docker on AWS, but also be able to build real-world, secure, and scalable container platforms in the cloud.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Build, deploy, and operate Docker applications using AWS\n</li><li>Solve key operational challenges, such as secrets management\n</li><li>Exploit the powerful capabilities and tight integration of other AWS services\n</li><li>Design and operate Docker applications running on ECS\n</li><li>Deploy Docker applications quickly, consistently, and reliably using IaC\n</li><li>Manage and operate Docker clusters and applications for no additional cost\n</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>Docker on Amazon Web Services is for you if you want to build, deploy, and operate applications using the power of containers, Docker, and Amazon Web Services. Basic understanding of containers and Amazon Web Services or any other cloud provider will be helpful, although no previous experience of working with these is required.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book You can download the example code files for all Packt books you have purchased from your account at http://www.PacktPub.com.

Next, we look at how to install (including using the new WSL2 mode) and get started with Docker. The next couple of chapters will focus on understanding the Dockerfile, including the structure and the core instructions used in building a Docker image. You'll also see how to distribute Docker images using Docker hub and other private registries. From there, you'll look at using Docker volumes for persisting data. Then learn how to run multi-container applications with Docker compose and learn inter-container networking works with Docker networks. Finally, you'll look at how to prepare a containerized application for production deployments.¬†</div><div><br/></div><div>Throughout the book you'll apply the techniques learned through the chapters by building a Telegram messenger Chatbot and see how much easier Docker makes it possible to build, release, contribute and distribute an application.

These containers are platform independent and can be executed on any host which runs a Linux kernel. Docker is one of the hottest tools in the market right now as a lot of teams have learned how to use it to break up their large, monolithic applications into smaller and more manageable units - often called microservices. This has allowed development teams to work on microservices independently and package it into a container once it is ready. Docker has also eased the pain of DevOps teams who often need to manage the deployment processes and environments - since containers can run independently of each other, they can simply focus on deploying containers rather than worrying about dependencies for each application. Container orchestration tools such as Docker Swarm and Kubernetes have made it very easy to deploy microservices to a cluster and scale them according to demand. For these reasons, Docker is a technology which you need to know if you're an app developer or DevOps engineer.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p><strong>4+ Hours of Video Instruction<br/>\n </strong><br/><em>Docker Containers LiveLessons</em> takes you through your first experiences understanding, running, building and managing Docker containers. These hands-on lessons help you explore Docker containers, registries, and run-time environments. It then extends that experience into container orchestration with Kubernetes.<br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>Description <br/>\n </strong> <br/>\n With cloud computing, applications need to move around efficiently and run almost anywhere. In this video, learn how you can create containerized applications with Docker that are lightweight and portable. First, Chris shows you how to begin using Docker on Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, or Fedora systems (with options of Windows or Mac OS X). Then he shows you how to pull and push Docker container images from and to Docker registries. The next few lessons get you started running container and investigating how they work. After that, you learn how to build your own Docker images. The video then examines orchestration tools such as Kubernetes and Cockpit and development tools such as OpenShift for deploying and managing containers. Finally, it provides some tips for developing your own Docker containers.</p><p><strong> About the Instructor</strong></p><p><strong>Christopher Negus</strong> is a Red Hat Certified Architect (RHCA) and principal technical writer for Red Hat, Inc. Currently, he is working on Linux containers in Docker format, Project Atomic, Kubernetes, and OpenStack projects.<br/>\n <br/>\nChris has authored dozens of books on Linux and open source software, including the <em>Linux Bible</em>, <em>Red Hat Linux Bible</em>, Linux Toolbox series, Linux Toys, and Live Linux CDs. He is a Red Hat Certified Instructor (RHCI) and Red Hat Certified Examiner, (RHCX). His RHCA certification includes expertise in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization (RHCVA), Red Hat Clustering and Storage Management, and Red Hat Enterprise Deployment and Systems Management. Earlier in his career, Chris worked at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories on the UNIX System V development team.</p><p><strong>Skill Level</strong></p><ul><li>Beginner to Intermediate</li></ul><p><strong>What You Will Learn</strong></p><ul><li>What Docker is and why you need it, including the basics of running, stopping, and restarting Docker containers</li><li>Installing Docker on standard Linux or specialized container operating systems</li><li>Setting up a private Docker Registry</li><li>Creating, running, and investigating Docker images and containers</li><li>How to pull and push containers between local systems and Docker Registries</li><li>Integrating Docker containers with host networking and storage</li><li>Orchestrating multiple containers into complex applications with Kubernetes</li><li>How to build a Docker container to simplify application deployment</li><li>Employing best practices when developing containerized applications</li><li>How others are creating their own interesting and powerful containers</li><li>The latest Docker supporting technology that is on the horizon</li></ul><p><strong>Who Should Take This Course</strong></p><ul><li>\n System administrators who need to create, deploy, and manage Docker containers\n </li><li>\n Application developers who want to understand what applications are most appropriate for containerization and what are best practices for adapting their applications to containers\n </li></ul><p><strong>Course Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>\n A basic understanding of running commands in Linux\n </li><li>\n Familiarity with Linux concepts such as networking, software repos, and storage\n </li><li>\n Familiarity with concepts related to deploying applications\n </li></ul><p><strong>Lesson 1: Welcome to Docker Containers<br/>\n </strong>In Lesson 1, \"Welcome to Docker Containers,\" you learn the benefits of running applications in Docker containers. You also learn where Docker came from, the components that make up Docker, and other initiatives that have grown up around the Docker project.<br/><br/><strong>Lesson 2: Getting Docker Software<br/>\n </strong>In Lesson 2, \"Getting Docker Software,\" you learn how to get Docker software and start it on the operating system that you choose. It includes procedures for installing Docker on Fedora, Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux distributions, as well as the lightweight Project Atomic operating system.<br/><br/><strong>Lesson 3: Using Docker Registries<br/>\n </strong>In Lesson 3, \"Using Docker Registries,\" you start using Docker registries. Docker registries are places where container images are stored. There is a public Docker registry available (referred to as the Docker Index or Hub), but you can also set up private registries to store your own containers.<br/><br/><strong>Lesson 4: Starting Up Containers<br/>\n </strong>In Lesson 4, \"Starting Up Containers,\" you start running containers on your Linux system. Once a container is running, you can explore your container in different ways, and then start and stop the containers as needed.<br/><br/><strong>Lesson 5: Making Docker Images from Containers<br/>\n </strong>In Lesson 5, \"Making Docker Images from Containers,\" you take containers you have made by running commands on your local system and save them as images you can transport. Once you have transported your new docker image to another system running docker, you can load the image and run it on that system. Or you could push your new image to the Docker Hub or to a private registry.<br/><br/><strong>Lesson 6: Keeping Your Docker Build System Healthy<br/>\n </strong>In Lesson 6, \"Keeping Your Docker Build System Healthy,\" you learn ways to query the state of your docker system and ways to keep it healthy, such as removing containers and images left on your system that you no longer need.<br/><br/><strong>Lesson 7: Building Docker Images<br/>\n </strong>In Lesson 7, \"Building Docker Images,\" you learn how to build a Docker container image that includes everything needed to run an application. <br/><br/><strong>Lesson 8: Tips for Building Containers<br/>\n </strong>In Lesson 8, \"Tips for Building Containers,\" you learn some simple rules to get better results from the containers you run, build, and manage. In particular, working with software repositories, networking, and storage are given extra attention in this lesson.<br/><br/><strong>Lesson 9: Orchestrating Docker Containers<br/>\n </strong>Lesson 9, \"Orchestrating Docker Containers,\" introduces you to the concept of container orchestration how to manage multiple containers in pods using replication controllers and services in Kubernetes. This includes a demonstration of an all-in-one Kubernetes master and node as well as an example of how to set up a Kubernetes cluster. After that, you explore the Cockpit Web-based interface for managing containers.<br/><br/><strong>Lesson 10: Developing Containerized Applications<br/>\n </strong>Lesson 10, \"Developing Containerized Applications,\" describes applications you should keep an eye on that are currently in development for deploying containerized applications.</p><p><strong>Lesson 11: Digging into Advanced Networking and Storage<br/>\n</strong>Lesson 11, \"Digging into Advanced Networking and Storage,\" starts with descriptions for setting up default networking for your Docker systems, as well as how to change networking for individual containers. After that, it tells how containers can use storage from the host computer by mounting volumes and how to share storage volumes among containers.</p><p><strong>Lesson 12: Running Super Privileged Containers<br/>\n</strong>In Lesson 12, \"Running Super Privileged Containers,\" you learn about how Docker relies on the Linux Container feature (LXC) to separate containers from the Linux host. Building on that knowledge, you learn how to open containers to individual name spaces on the host or open containers completely to the host using what are referred to as super privileged containers.</p><p><strong>Lesson 13: Going Further with Docker<br/>\n </strong>In Lesson 13, \"Going Further with Docker,\" you extend the knowledge you gained in earlier lessons to explore other containerization tools. Next, you see techniques others have developed for creating Dockerfiles for building containers and see a few containers for playing games.<br/></p><p><strong>About LiveLessons Video Training<br/>\n </strong><br/>\n The LiveLessons Video Training series publishes hundreds of hands-on, expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

Managing Docker containers in the multi-node or multi-datacenter environment is a big challenge, which is why container management platforms are required. OpenShift is a new generation of container management platforms built on top of both Docker and Kubernetes. It brings additional functionality to the table, something that is lacking in Kubernetes. This new functionality significantly helps software development teams to bring software development processes to a whole new level.\n</p><p>In this book, we'll start by explaining the container architecture, Docker, and CRI-O overviews. Then, we'll look at container orchestration and Kubernetes. We'll cover OpenShift installation, and its basic and advanced components. Moving on, we'll deep dive into concepts such as deploying application OpenShift. You'll learn how to set up an end-to-end delivery pipeline while working with applications in OpenShift as a developer or DevOps. Finally, you'll discover how to properly design OpenShift in production environments.\n</p><p>This book gives you hands-on experience of designing, building, and operating OpenShift Origin 3.9, as well as building new applications or migrating existing applications to OpenShift.\n</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Understand the core concepts behind containers and container orchestration tools\n</li><li>Understand Docker, Kubernetes, and OpenShift, and their relation to CRI-O\n</li><li>Install and work with Kubernetes and OpenShift\n</li><li>Understand how to work with persistent storage in OpenShift\n</li><li>Understand basic and advanced components of OpenShift, including security and networking\n</li><li>Manage deployment strategies and application's migration in OpenShift\n</li><li>Understand and design OpenShift high availability \n</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>The book is for system administrators, DevOps engineers, solutions architects, or any stakeholder who wants to understand the concept and business value of OpenShift.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book You can download the example code files for all Packt books you have purchased from your account at http://www.PacktPub.com.

After starting with a clear explanation of the Docker model, you will learn how to package applications in containers, including techniques for testing and distributing applications. You will also learn how to run programs securely and how to manage shared resources. Using carefully designed examples, the book/course teaches you how to orchestrate containers and applications from installation to removal. Along the way, you'll discover techniques for using Docker on systems ranging from dev-and-test machines to full-scale cloud deployments.</p>\n<p>The idea behind Docker is simple. Create a tiny virtual environment, called a container, that holds just your application and its dependencies. The Docker engine uses the host operating system to build and account for these containers. They are easy to install, manage, and remove.

    "description": "<span><p>\nOne of the important aspects of MLOps, also known as Machine Learning Operations or Operationalizing Machine learning, is to package ML models. How exactly do you package ML models? In this video I show you exactly what that means, and go through the process of packaging an ONNX model taken from the ONNX Model Zoo. I end up with a docker container that can be shared, exposing an API that is ready to consume and perform live predictions for sentiment analysis.\n<br/>\nTopics include:\n<br/>\n* What are the concepts behind packaging Machine Learning Models\n<br/>\n* Create a sentiment analysis API tool with Flask\n<br/>\n* Define dependencies and a Dockerfile for packaging\n<br/>\n* Create a container with an ONNX model that can be deployed anywhere with an HTTP API\n<br/>\n\nA few resources that are helpful if you are trying to get started with SBOMs, generating them and using them to capture vulnerabilities:\n\n<br/>\n* The <a href=\"https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/master/text/machine_comprehension/roberta\">RoBERTa ONNX Model</a>\n<br/>\n* <a href=\"http://label-schema.org/rc1/\">Schema labeling concetps</a> for Docker containers\n<br/>\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/paiml/practical-mlops-book/\">The Practical MLOps code respository full of examples</a>\n</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Take container cluster management to the next level; learn how to administer and configure Kubernetes on CoreOS; and apply suitable management design patterns such as Configmaps, Autoscaling, elastic resource usage, and high availability. Some of the other features discussed are logging, scheduling, rolling updates, volumes, service types, and multiple cloud provider zones. The atomic unit of modular container service in Kubernetes is a Pod, which is a group of containers with a common filesystem and networking. The Kubernetes Pod abstraction enables design patterns for containerized applications similar to object-oriented design patterns. Containers provide some of the same benefits as software objects such as modularity or packaging, abstraction, and reuse.</p><p>CoreOS Linux is used in the majority of the chapters and other platforms discussed are CentOS with OpenShift, Debian 8 (jessie) on AWS, and Debian 7 for Google Container Engine.</p><p>CoreOS is the main focus becayse Docker is pre-installed on CoreOS out-of-the-box. CoreOS:</p><ul><li><p>Supports most cloud providers (including Amazon AWS EC2 and Google Cloud Platform) and virtualization platforms (such as VMWare and VirtualBox)</p></li><li><p>Provides Cloud-Config for declaratively configuring for OS items such as network configuration (flannel), storage (etcd), and user accounts</p></li><li><p>Provides a production-level infrastructure for containerized applications including automation, security, and scalability</p></li><li><p>Leads the drive for container industry standards and founded appc</p></li><li><p>Provides the most advanced container registry, Quay</p></li></ul><p>Docker was made available as open source in March 2013 and has become the most commonly used containerization platform. Kubernetes was open-sourced in June 2014 and has become the most widely used container cluster manager.

Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries, and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.</p><p>Docker accelerates the development, sharing, and execution of modern applications. Docker is a tool that uses containers to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications.</p><p>In this course, you will learn about virtual machines and containers, installation of Docker, understanding Docker architecture, start/stop/restart Docker Daemon, Docker commands to manage images and containers, Docker volumes, Bind Mounts, tmpfs volume, Docker networking concepts, and deploying a web application as a Docker container.</p><p>Docker has made use of pre-existing computing concepts such as containers and, more specifically, primitives known as \"groups\" and \"namespaces\" in the Linux world. Docker's technology is distinctive in that it focuses on the needs of developers and system administrators to separate application dependencies from infrastructure.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will gain an in-depth understanding of the fundamentals/essential Docker concepts and commands required to deploy a web application.</p><p><b>Audience</b></p><p>This course is designed for DevOps engineers, system administrators, and Cloud engineers who want to learn about Docker for advanced purposes.</p><p>This will also suit DevOps managers working for any organization.</p><p>Basic IT Concepts are required to get the most out of this course.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Traditional methods for creating intelligent computational systems have<br/>privileged private \"internal\" cognitive and computational processes. In<br/>contrast, <i>Swarm Intelligence</i> argues that human<br/>intelligence derives from the interactions of individuals in a social world<br/>and further, that this model of intelligence can be effectively applied to<br/>artificially intelligent systems. The authors first present the foundations of<br/>this new approach through an extensive review of the critical literature in<br/>social psychology, cognitive science, and evolutionary computation. They<br/>then show in detail how these theories and models apply to a new<br/>computational intelligence methodology‚Äîparticle swarms‚Äîwhich focuses<br/>on adaptation as the key behavior of intelligent systems. Drilling down<br/>still further, the authors describe the practical benefits of applying particle<br/>swarm optimization to a range of engineering problems. Developed by<br/>the authors, this algorithm is an extension of cellular automata and<br/>provides a powerful optimization, learning, and problem solving method. <br/></p><p><br/>This important book presents valuable new insights by exploring the<br/>boundaries shared by cognitive science, social psychology, artificial life,<br/>artificial intelligence, and evolutionary computation and by applying these<br/>insights to the solving of difficult engineering problems. Researchers and<br/>graduate students in any of these disciplines will find the material<br/>intriguing, provocative, and revealing as will the curious and savvy<br/>computing professional.<br/><br/>* Places particle swarms within the larger context of intelligent<br/>adaptive behavior and evolutionary computation. <br/>* Describes recent results of experiments with the particle swarm<br/>optimization (PSO) algorithm <br/>* Includes a basic overview of statistics to ensure readers can<br/>properly analyze the results of their own experiments using the<br/>algorithm. <br/>* Support software which can be downloaded from the publishers<br/>website, includes a Java PSO applet, C and Visual Basic source<br/>code.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><div>Learn Docker \"infrastructure as code\" technology to define a system for performing standard but non-trivial data tasks on medium- to large-scale data sets, using Jupyter as the master controller.</div><div><br/></div><div>It is not uncommon for a real-world data set to fail to be easily managed. The set may not fit well into access memory or may require prohibitively long processing. These are significant challenges to skilled software engineers and they can render the standard Jupyter system unusable.¬†<br/></div><div><br/></div><div>As a solution to this problem, <i>Docker for Data Science</i>¬†proposes using Docker. You will learn how to use existing pre-compiled public images created by the major open-source technologies‚ÄîPython, Jupyter, Postgres‚Äîas well as using the Dockerfile to extend these images to suit your specific purposes. The Docker-Compose technology is examined and you will learn how it can be used to build a linked system with Python churning data behind the scenes and Jupyter managing these background tasks. Best practices in using existing images are explored as well as developing your own images to deploy state-of-the-art machine learning and optimization algorithms.</div><div><br/></div><div><div><b>What ¬†You'll Learn¬†</b></div><div><ul><li>Master interactive development using the Jupyter platform<br/></li><li>Run and build Docker containers from scratch and from publicly available open-source images<br/></li><li>Write infrastructure as code using the docker-compose tool and its docker-compose.yml file type<br/></li><li>Deploy a multi-service data science application¬†across a cloud-based system<br/></li></ul><div><br/></div></div><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b></div><div><br/></div><div><div>Data scientists, machine learning engineers, artificial intelligence researchers,¬†Kagglers, and software developers</div></div><div><br/></div></div></span></span></span>",

There‚Äôs one thing you need to know to package your own applications: you can also run commands inside Dockerfiles.\nCommands execute during the build, and any filesystem changes from the command are saved in the image layer. That makes Dockerfiles about the most flexible packaging format there is; you can expand zip files, run Windows installers, and do pretty much anything else. In this chapter you‚Äôll use that flexibility to package applications from source code.",
