Many people call themselves\nhackers, but few have the strong technical foundation needed to\nreally push the envelope.\n</p><p>Rather than merely showing how to run existing exploits, author\nJon Erickson explains how arcane hacking techniques actually work.\nTo share the art and science of hacking in a way that is accessible\nto everyone, Hacking: The Art of Exploitation, 2nd Edition\nintroduces the fundamentals of C programming from a hacker's\nperspective.</p><p>The included LiveCD provides a complete Linux programming and\ndebugging environment-all without modifying your current operating\nsystem. Use it to follow along with the book's examples as you fill\ngaps in your knowledge and explore hacking techniques on your own.\nGet your hands dirty debugging code, overflowing buffers, hijacking\nnetwork communications, bypassing protections, exploiting\ncryptographic weaknesses, and perhaps even inventing new exploits.\nThis book will teach you how to:</p><p/><ul><li><p>Program computers using C, assembly language, and shell\nscripts</p></li><li/><li><p>Corrupt system memory to run arbitrary code using buffer\noverflows and format strings</p></li><li/><li><p>Inspect processor registers and system memory with a debugger\nto gain a real understanding of what is happening</p></li><li/><li><p>Outsmart common security measures like nonexecutable stacks and\nintrusion detection systems</p></li><li/><li><p>Gain access to a remote server using port-binding or\nconnect-back shellcode, and alter a server's logging behavior to\nhide your presence</p></li><li/><li><p>Redirect network traffic, conceal open ports, and hijack TCP\nconnections</p></li><li/><li><p>Crack encrypted wireless traffic using the FMS attack, and\nspeed up brute-force attacks using a password probability\nmatrix</p></li></ul><p>Hackers are always pushing the boundaries, investigating the\nunknown, and evolving their art. Even if you don't already know how\nto program, Hacking: The Art of Exploitation, 2nd Edition will give\nyou a complete picture of programming, machine architecture,\nnetwork communications, and existing hacking techniques. Combine\nthis knowledge with the included Linux environment, and all you\nneed is your own creativity.</p></span>",

Module 1 willcover social engineering principles, tactics, techniques, attack vectors,malware families and attributes, password attacks, physical attacks,adversarial artificial intelligence, and identifying indicators of compromise(IOC). The lessons will then move into application weaknesses, validationissues, injection, XSS and forgery attacks, and explore various system attacks.Next up, it will take a look at digitalinfrastructure attacks, wireless attacks, and malicious code or script executionincluding using PowerShell, Python. and Bash. The lessons also discussadversaries including means and motivation, threat modeling, and how to useOSINT—open source intelligence. The later lessons in this module cover some ofthe most common and dangerous operational vulnerabilities, risks associatedwith third-parties, threat hunting, vulnerability identification, andautomation tools including SIEM and SOAR. Lastly, the module discusses the importance of penetrationtesting, pen testing options, and how pen testing really works.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nModule 2, “Architecture and Design,” corresponds to the second CompTIA domain, which makes up 21% of the exam questions. Within this module, configuration management, data protection concepts, deception and disruption techniques, and tactics are covered. It then examines the security and performance features of virtualization, cloud deployment, and cloud service models. Secure staging workflow, secure coding techniques, and the role of automation with a focus on identify management, authentication factors, attributes and methods, as well as a deep dive into biometrics. The lesson then discusses resiliency, non-persistence, redundancy, and backup and recovery techniques including RAID and replication. Next up is defining what embedded and IoT systems are, look at why and when they are embedded they are vulnerable to attack, and discuss best practices for securing embedded and IoT systems. The module then focuses attention on building and facility design considerations and controls, environmental issues such as air flow, heat, humidity, electrostatic discharge, date emanation, fire, and power as well as secure data destruction. The next lesson begins with a primer, and then surveys cryptographic and related use cases and techniques including steganography, symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, hashing, digital signatures, and emerging cryptography.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nModule 3, “Implementation,” corresponds to 25% of the exam questions and covers a lot. The module starts by looking at the practical application and use cases of secure communications and network protocols including SSl/TLS, SSH, DNSSEC, SNMPv3, and secure email protocols. Then, it surveys trusted computing-base components and endpoint security solutions, as well as meeting security objectives by implementing zone, segmentation, and isolation options and network appliances including jump servers, proxy servers, IDS/IPS, NACS, firewalls and VPNS. The lesson ends with a look at the TCP/IP model. The module continues with a dive into wireless design and configuration options with an emphasis on planning a secure wireless network, as well as looking at mobile device connection methods, mobile device deployment options, Mobile device management solutions (commonly known as MDM), and mobile device concerns including attack vectors. Next up is revisiting the cloud environment—this time from an infrastructure perspective. The module looks at design options; use of virtual private clouds and critically cloud security controls; explores the entire user identity and access management lifecycle; and dives into the configuration elements of network and web services including LDAP, Kerberos, TACACS+, RADIUS, CHAP, PAP, SAML, OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and Shibboleth as well as access control and authorization models. Lastly, the module focuses on creating and managing digital certificates as well as cryptovariable (key) management and best practices.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nModule 4, “Operations and Incident Response,” covers about 16% of the exam and starts by surveying network reconnaissance and discovery approaches; tools and techniques including scanning, packet capture, and netflows; and introduces Linux operating system commands security practitioners should be familiar with. Then, the importance of incident response preparedness is discussed, as well as defining the elements of an incident response plan, identifying the phases of incident response, reviewing the process, and studying attack frameworks. Next, the module revisits a number of data sources including scans, logs, and metadata from an investigative perspective. The final lessons of this module discuss a variety of manual and automated mitigation, containment and eradication techniques and controls, and then tackles forensic fundamentals including evidence collection, data acquisition and breach disclosure, and notification requirements.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nModule 5, “Governance, Risk and Compliance,” covers about 14% of the exam. The module starts by taking a close look at control management, control classifications, and control objectives, which taken together comprise an defense-in-depth environment. It then dives into cybersecurity and privacy related regulations and obligations and how to build a compliance information security program incorporating frameworks, benchmarks, and audit standards. The module then examines the role of policies and supporting governance documents, identify key personnel and operational policies and practices, as well as third-party and supply chain risk management. Next, the module identifies fundamental risk management and assessment concepts, teaches how to conduct a quantitative risk assessment and walks through the fundamental concepts of business continuity, including facilitating a business impact assessment. Lastly, it focuses on data classification, privacy requirements and obligations, roles and responsibilities, privacy enhancing technologies, and the relationship between cybersecurity and privacy.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>About Pearson Video Training</strong>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nPearson publishes expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

Longtime security professional John Viega, formerly Chief Security Architect at McAfee, reports on the sorry state of the industry, and offers concrete suggestions for professionals and individuals confronting the issue. <br/><br/>Why is security so bad? With many more people online than just a few years ago, there are more attackers -- and they're truly motivated. Attacks are sophisticated, subtle, and harder to detect than ever. But, as Viega notes, few people take the time to understand the situation and protect themselves accordingly. This book tells you:</p><p/><ul><li>Why it's easier for bad guys to \"own\" your computer than you think</li><li>Why anti-virus software doesn't work well -- and one simple way to fix it</li><li>Whether Apple OS X is more secure than Windows</li><li>What Windows needs to do better</li><li>How to make strong authentication pervasive</li><li>Why patch management is so bad</li><li>Whether there's anything you can do about identity theft</li><li>Five easy steps for fixing application security, and more</li></ul><p>Provocative, insightful, and always controversial, <em>The Myths of Security</em> not only addresses IT professionals who deal with security issues, but also speaks to Mac and PC users who spend time online.</p></div></span></span>",

Today, every time you make a site live, you’re opening it up to attack.</p><p>A first-time developer can easily be discouraged by the difficulties involved with properly securing a website. But have hope: an army of security researchers is out there discovering, documenting, and fixing security flaws. Thankfully, the tools you’ll need to secure your site are freely available and generally easy to use.</p><p><i>Web Security for Developers</i> will teach you how your websites are vulnerable to attack and how to protect them. Each chapter breaks down a major security vulnerability and explores a real-world attack, coupled with plenty of code to show you both the vulnerability and the fix. You’ll learn how to:</p><p>•Protect against SQL injection attacks, malicious JavaScript, and cross-site request forgery<br/>•Add authentication and shape access control to protect accounts<br/>•Lock down user accounts to prevent attacks that rely on guessing passwords, stealing sessions, or escalating privileges<br/>•Implement encryption<br/>•Manage vulnerabilities in legacy code<br/>•Prevent information leaks that disclose vulnerabilities<br/>•Mitigate advanced attacks like malvertising and denial-of-service </p><p>As you get stronger at identifying and fixing vulnerabilities, you’ll learn to deploy disciplined, secure code and become a better programmer along the way.</p></div></span>",

They cling to the belief that security is something you can just buy and bolt on, but that’s not the case. It’s not that developers want to be bad at security, they just don’t know where to start and where they should go.  This video offers a clear route.  It begins with a high level overview of today’s security threats and the organizational strategies used to counter those threats; it details the roles that SSG members, developers, testers and operations personnel must perform in a security focused SDLC; and finishes with a survey of the protocols, tactics, and tools used to optimize security at the physical, network, application, and perimeter levels.</p><ul><li>Understand the goals, costs, and limitations of software security</li><li>Identify fifteen types of security attacks such as WebSocket, SQL injection, and TLS Heartbleed</li><li>Discover six core principles of software security including Defense in Depth and Fail Securely</li><li>Learn about threat modeling using tools like STRIDE, CAPEC, and attack trees</li><li>Recognize the capabilities and limitations of password policies, WAFS, and Firewalls</li><li>Review authentication/authorization techniques like HTTP Digest, OAuth 2 and JWT</li><li>Learn about the CORS, CSP, and HSTS security policies and protocols</li><li>Explore the W3C Web Cryptography Working Group’s newest security protocols</li></ul><p>Brian Sletten is a software engineer who focuses on security consulting, web architecture, resource-oriented computing, social networking, the Semantic Web, data science, 3D graphics, visualization, scalable systems, and other technologies.

    "title": "Network Security with OpenSSL",
    "description": "<span><span><p>Most applications these days are at least somewhat network aware, but how do you protect those applications against common network security threats?  Many developers are turning to OpenSSL, an open source version of SSL/TLS, which is the most widely used protocol for secure network communications.The OpenSSL library is seeing widespread adoption for web sites that require cryptographic functions to protect a broad range of sensitive information, such as credit card numbers and other financial transactions. The library is the only free, full-featured SSL implementation for C and C++,  and it can be used programmatically or from the command line to secure most TCP-based network protocols.<i>Network Security with OpenSSL</i> enables developers to use this protocol much more effectively. Traditionally, getting something simple done in OpenSSL could easily take weeks.   This concise book gives you the guidance you need to avoid pitfalls, while allowing you to take advantage of the library?s advanced features.   And, instead of bogging you down in the technical details of how SSL works under the hood, this book provides only the information that is necessary to use OpenSSL safely and effectively.  In step-by-step fashion, the book details the challenges in securing network communications, and shows you how to use OpenSSL tools to best meet those challenges.As a system or network administrator, you will benefit from the thorough treatment of the OpenSSL command-line interface, as well as from step-by-step directions for obtaining certificates and setting up your own certification authority.  As a developer, you will further benefit from the in-depth discussions and examples of how to use OpenSSL in your own programs.  Although OpenSSL is written in C, information on how to use OpenSSL with Perl, Python and PHP is also included.OpenSSL may well answer your need to protect sensitive data. If that?s the case, <i>Network Security with OpenSSL</i> is the only guide available on the subject.</p></span></span>",

This book takes a fundamental approach to NSM, complete with dozens of real-world examples that teach you the key concepts of NSM. </p><p>Network security monitoring is based on the principle that prevention eventually fails. In the current threat landscape, no matter how much you try, motivated attackers will eventually find their way into your network. At that point, it is your ability to detect and respond to that intrusion that can be the difference between a small incident and a major disaster.</p><p>The book follows the three stages of the NSM cycle: collection, detection, and analysis. As you progress through each section, you will have access to insights from seasoned NSM professionals while being introduced to relevant, practical scenarios complete with sample data.</p><p>If you've never performed NSM analysis, <i>Applied Network Security Monitoring</i> will give you an adequate grasp on the core concepts needed to become an effective analyst. If you are already a practicing analyst, this book will allow you to grow your analytic technique to make you more effective at your job.</p><ul><li>Discusses the proper methods for data collection, and teaches you how to become a skilled NSM analyst</li><li>Provides thorough hands-on coverage of Snort, Suricata, Bro-IDS, SiLK, and Argus</li><li>Loaded with practical examples containing real PCAP files you can replay, and uses Security Onion for all its lab examples</li><li>Companion website includes up-to-date blogs from the authors about the latest developments in NSM</li></ul></span>",

Stallings draws on the immense work that has been collected in multiple key security documents, making this knowledge far more accessible than it has ever been before. <strong>Effective Cybersecurity</strong> is organized to align with the comprehensive Information Security Forum document The Standard of Good Practice for Information Security, but deepens, extends, and complements ISF’s work with extensive insights from the ISO 27002 Code of Practice for Information Security Controls, the NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, COBIT 5 for Information Security, and a wide spectrum of standards and guidelines documents from ISO, ITU-T, NIST, Internet RFCs, other official sources, and the professional, academic, and industry literature.</p><p>In a single expert source, current and aspiring cybersecurity practitioners will find comprehensive and usable practices for successfully implementing cybersecurity within any organization. Stallings covers:</p><ul><li><p>Security Planning: Developing approaches for managing and controlling the cybersecurity function; defining the requirements specific to a given IT environment; and developing policies and procedures for managing the security function</p></li><li><p>Security Management: Implementing the controls to satisfy the defined security requirements</p></li><li><p>Security Evaluation: Assuring that the security management function enables business continuity; monitoring, assessing, and improving the suite of cybersecurity controls.</p></li></ul><p>Beyond requiring a basic understanding of cryptographic terminology and applications, this book is self-contained: all technology areas are explained without requiring other reference material. Each chapter contains a clear technical overview, as well as a detailed discussion of action items and appropriate policies. Stallings, author of 13 TAA Computer Science Textbooks of the Year, offers many pedagogical features designed to help readers master the material. These include: clear learning objectives, keyword lists, and glossaries to QR codes linking to relevant standards documents and web resources.</p></div></span>",

Most existing tools work on the TCP/IP level, failing to use the specifics of the HTTP protocol in their operation. Mod_security is a module running on Apache, which will help you overcome the security threats prevalent in the online world.\n</p><p>\nA complete guide to using ModSecurity, this book will show you how to secure your web application and server, and does so by using real-world examples of attacks currently in use. It will help you learn about SQL injection, cross-site scripting attacks, cross-site request forgeries, null byte attacks, and many more so that you know how attackers operate.\nUsing clear, step-by-step instructions this book starts by teaching you how to install and set up ModSecurity, before diving into the rule language with examples. It assumes no prior knowledge of ModSecurity, so as long as you are familiar with basic Linux administration, you can start to learn right away.</p><p>\nReal-life case studies are used to illustrate the dangers on the Web today – you will for example learn how the recent worm that hit Twitter works, and how you could have used ModSecurity to stop it in its tracks. The mechanisms behind these and other attacks are described in detail, and you will learn everything you need to know to make sure your server and web application remain unscathed on the increasingly dangerous web. Have you ever wondered how attackers figure out the exact web server version running on a system? They use a technique called HTTP fingerprinting, and you will learn about this in depth and how to defend against it by flying your web server under a \"\"false flag\"\".</p><p>\nThe last part of the book shows you how to really lock down a web application by implementing a positive security model that only allows through requests that conform to a specific, pre-approved model, and denying anything that is even the slightest bit out of line.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>How secure is your network? The best way to find out is to attack it. <em>Network Security Assessment</em> provides you with the tricks and tools professional security consultants use to identify and assess risks in Internet-based networks-the same penetration testing model they use to secure government, military, and commercial networks. With this book, you can adopt, refine, and reuse this testing model to design and deploy networks that are hardened and immune from attack.<br/><br/><em>Network Security Assessment</em> demonstrates how a determined attacker scours Internet-based networks in search of vulnerable components, from the network to the application level. This new edition is up-to-date on the latest hacking techniques, but rather than focus on individual issues, it looks at the bigger picture by grouping and analyzing threats at a high-level. By grouping threats in this way, you learn to create defensive strategies against entire attack categories, providing protection now and into the future.<br/><br/><em>Network Security Assessment</em> helps you assess:</p><ul><li>Web services, including Microsoft IIS, Apache, Tomcat, and subsystems such as OpenSSL, Microsoft FrontPage, and Outlook Web Access (OWA)</li><br/><br/><li>Web application technologies, including ASP, JSP, PHP, middleware, and backend databases such as MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server</li><br/><br/><li>Microsoft Windows networking components, including RPC, NetBIOS, and CIFS services</li><br/><br/><li>SMTP, POP3, and IMAP email services</li><br/><br/><li>IP services that provide secure inbound network access, including IPsec, Microsoft PPTP, and SSL VPNs</li><br/><br/><li>Unix RPC services on Linux, Solaris, IRIX, and other platforms</li><br/><br/><li>Various types of application-level vulnerabilities that hacker tools and scripts exploit</li><br/><br/></ul>Assessment is the first step any organization should take to start managing information risks correctly. With techniques to identify and assess risks in line with CESG CHECK and NSA IAM government standards, <em>Network Security Assessment</em> gives you a precise method to do just that.</div></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>SEMAT (Software Engineering Methods and\nTheory) is an international initiative designed to identify a\ncommon ground, or universal standard, for software engineering. It\nis supported by some of the most distinguished contributors to the\nfield. Creating a simple language to describe methods and\npractices, the SEMAT team expresses this common ground as a\nkernel–or framework–of elements essential to all\nsoftware development.</p><p><b><em>The Essence of Software\nEngineering</em></b> introduces this kernel and shows how to apply\nit when developing software and improving a team’s way of\nworking. It is a book for software professionals, not\nmethodologists. Its usefulness to development team members, who\nneed to evaluate and choose the best practices for their work, goes\nwell beyond the description or application of any single\nmethod.</p><p>“Software is both a craft and a\nscience, both a work of passion and a work of principle. Writing\ngood software requires both wild flights of imagination and\ncreativity, as well as the hard reality of engineering tradeoffs.\nThis book is an attempt at describing that balance.”</p><p>—Robert Martin (unclebob)</p><p>“The work of Ivar Jacobson and his\ncolleagues, started as part of the SEMAT initiative, has taken a\nsystematic approach to identifying a ‘kernel’ of\nsoftware engineering principles and practices that have stood the\ntest of time and recognition.”</p><p>—Bertrand Meyer</p><p>“The software development industry\nneeds and demands a core kernel and language for defining software\ndevelopment practices—practices that can be mixed and\nmatched, brought on board from other organizations; practices that\ncan be measured; practices that can be integrated; and practices\nthat can be compared and contrasted for speed, quality, and price.\nThis thoughtful book gives a good grounding in ways to think about\nthe problem, and a language to address the need, and every software\nengineer should read it.”</p><p>—Richard Soley</p></span></span>",

The first resource of its kind, this book provides authoritative guidance for real-world situations, and cross-functional solutions for enterprise-wide improvement. Beginning with an overview of counter-cyber evolution, the discussion quickly turns practical with design and implementation guidance for the range of capabilities expected of a robust cyber risk management system that is integrated with the enterprise risk management (ERM) system. Expert contributors from around the globe weigh in on specialized topics with tools and techniques to help any type or size of organization create a robust system tailored to its needs. Chapter summaries of required capabilities are aggregated to provide a new cyber risk maturity model used to benchmark capabilities and to road-map gap-improvement. </p><p>Cyber risk is a fast-growing enterprise risk, not just an IT risk. Yet seldom is guidance provided as to what this means. This book is the first to tackle in detail those enterprise-wide capabilities expected by Board, CEO and Internal Audit, of the diverse executive management functions that need to team up with the Information Security function in order to provide integrated solutions. </p><ul><li>Learn how cyber risk management can be integrated to better protect your enterprise</li><li>Design and benchmark new and improved practical counter-cyber capabilities</li><li>Examine planning and implementation approaches, models, methods, and more</li><li>Adopt a new cyber risk maturity model tailored to your enterprise needs</li></ul><p>The need to manage cyber risk across the enterprise—inclusive of the IT operations—is a growing concern as massive data breaches make the news on an alarmingly frequent basis. With a cyber risk management system now a business-necessary requirement, practitioners need to assess the effectiveness of their current system, and measure its gap-improvement over time in response to a dynamic and fast-moving threat landscape. <i>The Cyber Risk Handbook</i> brings the world's best thinking to bear on aligning that system to the enterprise and vice-a-versa. Every functional head of any organization must have a copy at-hand to understand their role in achieving that alignment.</p></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p/><p><em>Enterprise Cybersecurity</em> empowers organizations of all sizes to defend themselves with next-generation cybersecurity programs against the escalating threat of modern targeted cyberattacks. This book presents a comprehensive framework for managing all aspects of an enterprise cybersecurity program. It enables an enterprise to architect, design, implement, and operate a coherent cybersecurity program that is seamlessly coordinated with policy, programmatics, IT life cycle, and assessment.</p><p>Fail-safe cyberdefense is a pipe dream. Given sufficient time, an intelligent attacker can eventually defeat defensive measures protecting an enterprise’s computer systems and IT networks.</p><p>To prevail, an enterprise cybersecurity program must manage risk by detecting attacks early enough and delaying them long enough that the defenders have time to respond effectively. <em>Enterprise Cybersecurity</em> shows players at all levels of responsibility how to unify their organization’s people, budgets, technologies, and processes into a cost-efficient cybersecurity program capable of countering advanced cyberattacks and containing damage in the event of a breach.</p><p>The authors of <em>Enterprise Cybersecurity</em> explain at both strategic and tactical levels how to accomplish the mission of leading, designing, deploying, operating, managing, and supporting cybersecurity capabilities in an enterprise environment. The authors are recognized experts and thought leaders in this rapidly evolving field, drawing on decades of collective experience in cybersecurity and IT. In capacities ranging from executive strategist to systems architect to cybercombatant, Scott E. Donaldson, Stanley G. Siegel, Chris K. Williams, and Abdul Aslam have fought on the front lines of cybersecurity against advanced persistent threats to government, military, and business entities.</p></span></span>",

Together, they\ncan help bring together the experiences that we gained from working\nwith many clients to build a comprehensive view of security\ncapabilities and needs.</p><p>This book is intended to be a valuable resource for business\nleaders, security officers, and consultants who want to understand\nand implement enterprise security by considering a set of core\nsecurity capabilities and services.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span>\nJohnny Long's last book sold 12,000 units worldwide. Kevin Mitnick's last book sold 40,000 units in North America.<br/><br/>As the cliché goes, information is power. In this age of technology, an increasing majority of the world's information is stored electronically. It makes sense then that we rely on high-tech electronic protection systems to guard that information. As professional hackers, Johnny Long and Kevin Mitnick get paid to uncover weaknesses in those systems and exploit them. Whether breaking into buildings or slipping past industrial-grade firewalls, their goal has always been the same: extract the information using any means necessary. After hundreds of jobs, they have discovered the secrets to bypassing every conceivable high-tech security system. This book reveals those secrets; as the title suggests, it has nothing to do with high technology.<br/><br/>• Dumpster Diving<br/>Be a good sport and don’t read the two “D words written in big bold letters above, and act surprised when I tell you hackers can accomplish this without relying on a single bit of technology (punny). <br/>• Tailgating<br/>Hackers and ninja both like wearing black, and they do share the ability to slip inside a building and blend with the shadows.<br/>• Shoulder Surfing<br/>If you like having a screen on your laptop so you can see what you’re working on, don’t read this chapter.<br/>• Physical Security<br/>Locks are serious business and lock technicians are true engineers, most backed with years of hands-on experience. But what happens when you take the age-old respected profession of the locksmith and sprinkle it with hacker ingenuity?<br/>• Social Engineering with Jack Wiles<br/>Jack has trained hundreds of federal agents, corporate attorneys, CEOs and internal auditors on computer crime and security-related topics. His unforgettable presentations are filled with three decades of personal \"war stories\" from the trenches of Information Security and Physical Security. <br/>• Google Hacking<br/>A hacker doesn’t even need his own computer to do the necessary research. If he can make it to a public library, Kinko's or Internet cafe, he can use Google to process all that data into something useful.<br/>• P2P Hacking<br/>Let’s assume a guy has no budget, no commercial hacking software, no support from organized crime and no fancy gear. With all those restrictions, is this guy still a threat to you? Have a look at this chapter and judge for yourself.<br/>• People Watching<br/>Skilled people watchers can learn a whole lot in just a few quick glances. In this chapter we’ll take a look at a few examples of the types of things that draws a no-tech hacker’s eye.<br/>• Kiosks<br/>What happens when a kiosk is more than a kiosk? What happens when the kiosk holds airline passenger information? What if the kiosk holds confidential patient information? What if the kiosk holds cash?<br/>• Vehicle Surveillance<br/>Most people don’t realize that some of the most thrilling vehicular espionage happens when the cars aren't moving at all!\n</span>",

This is mandatory for IT students, job seekers, software developers, testers, and application managers.</p>\n\n<p>The OWASP Top 10 “is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.”</p>\n\n<p>This course follows a hands-on approach: you’ll exploit at least 10 vulnerabilities in a deliberately vulnerable web application. In each session, we will review and briefly discuss a single OWASP Top 10 risk and then you’ll be guided to search and exploit that weakness in the target application. Since you’ll have access to the web application source code, you’ll be able to spot the vulnerable source code and fix it.</p>\n\n<p>After completing this course, you’ll be comfortable answering security-related questions in your next job interview or bring security into your organization and into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><h5>In Video Editions the narrator reads the book while the content, figures, code listings, diagrams, and text appear on the screen. Like an audiobook that you can also watch as a video.</h5><br/> <i>A complete guide to the challenges and solutions in securing microservices architectures.</i><br/>\nMassimo Siani, FinDynamic<br/><br/>\n<p>Unlike traditional enterprise applications, Microservices applications are collections of independent components that function as a system. Securing the messages, queues, and API endpoints requires new approaches to security both in the infrastructure and the code. <i>Microservices Security in Action</i> teaches you how to address microservices-specific security challenges throughout the system. This practical guide includes plentiful hands-on exercises using industry-leading open-source tools and examples using Java and Spring Boot.</p>\n<h4>about the technology</h4>\n<p>Integrating independent services into a single system presents special security challenges in a microservices deployment. With proper planning, however, you can build in security from the start. Learn to create secure services and protect application data throughout development and deployment. As microservices continue to change enterprise application systems, developers and architects must learn to integrate security into their design and implementation. Because microservices are created as a system of independent components, each a possible point of failure, they can multiply the security risk. With proper planning, design, and implementation, you can reap the benefits of microservices while keeping your application data—and your company's reputation—safe!</p>\n<h4>about the book</h4>\n<p><i>Microservices Security in Action</i> is filled with solutions, teaching best practices for throttling and monitoring, access control, and microservice-to-microservice communications. Detailed code samples, exercises, and real-world use cases help you put what you've learned into production. Along the way, authors and software security experts Prabath Siriwardena and Nuwan Dias shine a light on important concepts like throttling, analytics gathering, access control at the API gateway, and microservice-to-microservice communication. You'll also discover how to securely deploy microservices using state-of-the-art technologies including Kubernetes, Docker, and the Istio service mesh. Lots of hands-on exercises secure your learning as you go, and this straightforward guide wraps up with a security process review and best practices. When you're finished reading, you'll be planning, designing, and implementing microservices applications with the priceless confidence that comes with knowing they're secure!</p>\n<h4>what's inside</h4>\n<ul><li>Microservice security concepts\n</li><li>Edge services with an API gateway\n</li><li>Deployments with Docker, Kubernetes, and Istio\n</li><li>Security testing at the code level\n</li><li>Communications with HTTP, gRPC, and Kafka\n</li></ul>\n<h4>about the audience</h4>\n<p>For experienced microservices developers with intermediate Java skills.</p>\n<h4>about the authors</h4>\n<p><b>Prabath Siriwardena</b> is the vice president of security architecture at WSO2. <b>Nuwan Dias</b> is the director of API architecture at WSO2.

    "title": "Security engineering 101: When good design and security work together",
    "description": "<span><span><div><p>Security concerns are often dealt with as an afterthought—the focus is on building a product, and then security features or compensating controls are thrown in after the product is nearly ready to launch. Why do so many development teams take this approach? For one, they may not have an application security team to advise them. Or the security team may be seen as a roadblock, insisting on things that make the product less user friendly, or in tension with performance goals or other business demands. But security doesn’t need to be a bolt-on in your software process; good design principles should go hand in hand with a strong security stance. What does your engineering team need to know to begin designing safer, more robust software from the get-go?</p><p>Drawing on experience working in application security with companies of various sizes and maturity levels, Wendy Knox Everette (Leviathan Security) focuses on several core principles and provides some resources for you to do more of a deep dive into various topics. Wendy begins by walking you through the design phase, covering the concerns you should pay attention to when you’re beginning work on a new feature or system: encapsulation, access control, building for observability, and preventing LangSec-style parsing issues. This is also the best place to perform an initial threat model, which sounds like a big scary undertaking but is really just looking at the moving pieces of this application and thinking about who might use them in unexpected ways, and why.</p><p>She then turns to security during the development phase. At this point, the focus is on enforcing secure defaults, using standard encryption libraries, protecting from malicious injection, insecure deserialization, and other common security issues. You’ll learn what secure configurations to enable, what monitoring and alerting to put in place, how to test your code, and how to update your application, especially any third-party dependencies.</p><p>Now that the software is being used by customers, are you done? Not really. It’s important to incorporate information about how customers interact as well as any security incidents back into your design considerations for the next version. This is the time to dust off the initial threat model and update it, incorporating everything you learned along the way.</p></div></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>In the race to remain competitive, development teams in many companies are under tremendous pressure to create software on tight deadlines. And in most cases, that means dealing with security bugs only after software is released. But offensive testing and incident response are poor substitutes for good code, strong architecture, and threat-based design.</p><p>In this ebook, April C. Wright—security risk and compliance program advisor for a Fortune 15 company—teaches InfoSec professionals how to promote security as an integral part of an organization’s software development life cycle (SDLC). You’ll learn how to analyze existing development processes, gain insight into how developers and other stakeholders view software development, receive practical advice for including secure practices throughout the lifecycle, and learn how to track performance and success of your program.</p><ul><li>Get guidelines for evaluating your SDLC and rebuilding your development program</li><li>Understand how developers, project managers, business execs, customers, and other key stakeholders each approach software development</li><li>Gain active stakeholder participation and management support for SDLC security improvements</li><li>Work directly with stakeholders to explain secure development, and push for change through policy and compliance</li><li>Increase software security awareness by integrating development teams with security teams</li><li>Get started through sample checklists and planning documents</li></ul></div></span>",

This is the dark net—a hidden place where individuals and groups seek anonymity. It provides sanctuary for people living under authoritarian regimes, consumers tired of being treated as digital marketing assets, and cyber criminals looking to infiltrate corporate networks undetected.</p><p>In this O’Reilly report, authors Greg Fell and Mike Barlow explore both the benign and malevolent activities of the dark net (and the dark Web). For people who want to control their digital identities, new email servers and browsers ensure privacy. But for criminals, the dark net is an ideal place to steal and store vital information with impunity.</p><p>Learn about the surprising origin of the dark net, and find out how you can patrol this not-so-secret domain to detect and thwart intruders.</p></div></span>",

If you are new to network\nsecurity, don't put this book back on the shelf! This is a great\nbook for beginners and I wish I had access to it many years ago. If\nyou've learned the basics of TCP/IP protocols and run an open\nsource or commercial IDS, you may be asking 'What's next?' If so,\nthis book is for you.\"</p><p>         —Ron\nGula, founder and CTO, Tenable Network Security, from the\nForeword</p><p>\"Richard Bejtlich has a good perspective on Internet\nsecurity—one that is orderly and practical at the same time.\nHe keeps readers grounded and addresses the fundamentals in an\naccessible way.\"</p><p>\n         —Marcus\nRanum, TruSecure</p><p>\"This book is not about security or network monitoring: It's\nabout both, and in reality these are two aspects of the same\nproblem. You can easily find people who are security experts or\nnetwork monitors, but this book explains how to master both\ntopics.\"</p><p>\n         —Luca\nDeri, ntop.org</p><p>\"This book will enable security professionals of all skill sets\nto improve their understanding of what it takes to set up,\nmaintain, and utilize a successful network intrusion detection\nstrategy.\"</p><p>\n         —Kirby\nKuehl, Cisco Systems</p><p>Every network can be compromised. There are too many systems,\noffering too many services, running too many flawed applications.\nNo amount of careful coding, patch management, or access control\ncan keep out every attacker. If prevention eventually fails, how do\nyou prepare for the intrusions that will eventually happen?</p><p>Network security monitoring (NSM) equips security staff to deal\nwith the inevitable consequences of too few resources and too many\nresponsibilities. NSM collects the data needed to generate better\nassessment, detection, and response processes—resulting in\ndecreased impact from unauthorized activities.</p><p>In <b><em>The Tao of Network Security Monitoring</em></b>, Richard\nBejtlich explores the products, people, and processes that\nimplement the NSM model. By focusing on case studies and the\napplication of open source tools, he helps you gain hands-on\nknowledge of how to better defend networks and how to mitigate\ndamage from security incidents.</p><p>Inside, you will find in-depth information on the following\nareas.</p><li><p>The NSM operational framework and deployment\nconsiderations.</p></li><li><p>How to use a variety of open-source tools—including\nSguil, Argus, and Ethereal—to mine network traffic for full\ncontent, session, statistical, and alert data.</p></li><li><p>Best practices for conducting emergency NSM in an incident\nresponse scenario, evaluating monitoring vendors, and deploying an\nNSM architecture.</p></li><li><p>Developing and applying knowledge of weapons, tactics,\ntelecommunications, system administration, scripting, and\nprogramming for NSM.</p></li><li><p>The best tools for generating arbitrary packets, exploiting\nflaws, manipulating traffic, and conducting reconnaissance.</p></li><p>Whether you are new to network intrusion detection and incident\nresponse, or a computer-security veteran, this book will enable you\nto quickly develop and apply the skills needed to detect, prevent,\nand respond to new and emerging threats.</p></span>",

    "title": "Simple Steps to Data Encryption",
    "description": "<span><p>Everyone wants privacy and security online, something that most computer users have more or less given up on as far as their personal data is concerned. There is no shortage of good encryption software, and no shortage of books, articles and essays that purport to be about how to use it. Yet there is precious little for ordinary users who want just enough information about encryption to use it safely and securely and appropriately--WITHOUT having to become experts in cryptography.</p><p>Data encryption is a powerful tool, if used properly. Encryption turns ordinary, readable data into what looks like gibberish, but gibberish that only the end user can turn back into readable data again. The difficulty of encryption has much to do with deciding what kinds of threats one needs to protect against and then using the proper tool in the correct way. It's kind of like a manual transmission in a car: learning to drive with one is easy; learning to build one is hard.</p><p>The goal of this title is to present just enough for an average reader to begin protecting his or her data, immediately. Books and articles currently available about encryption start out with statistics and reports on the costs of data loss, and quickly get bogged down in cryptographic theory and jargon followed by attempts to comprehensively list all the latest and greatest tools and techniques. After step-by-step walkthroughs of the download and install process, there's precious little room left for what most readers really want: how to encrypt a thumb drive or email message, or digitally sign a data file.</p><p>There are terabytes of content that explain how cryptography works, why it's important, and all the different pieces of software that can be used to do it; there is precious little content available that couples concrete threats to data with explicit responses to those threats. This title fills that niche.</p><p>By reading this title readers will be provided with a step by step hands-on guide that includes:</p><ul><p> </p><li>Simple descriptions of actual threat scenarios </li><p> </p><li>Simple, step-by-step instructions for securing data</li><p> </p><li>How to use open source, time-proven and peer-reviewed cryptographic software </li><p> </p><li>Easy to follow tips for safer computing </li><p> </p><li>Unbiased and platform-independent coverage of encryption tools and techniques</li></ul><ul><li>Simple descriptions of actual threat scenarios </li><li>Simple, step-by-step instructions for securing data</li><li>How to use open source, time-proven and peer-reviewed cryptographic software </li><li>Easy-to-follow tips for safer computing </li><li>Unbiased and platform-independent coverage of encryption tools and techniques</li></ul></span>",

Anyone wishing to take the CCNA CyberOps exam would also benefit from viewing this course.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Course Requirements</strong>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nThe video course assumes that the learner has the skills to navigate the user interface of a PC running on Microsoft Window, Mac, or Linux and who has completed typical high school-level math courses (mainly that the reader has been exposed to binary math). The course also assumes that the reader has used PCs connected to either a home network or a network inside a school or company, but that the reader might not understand anything about the network to which the PC was connected. It is also assumed that the reader knows how to use typical Internet applications, primarily web browsers, and email clients.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson Descriptions</strong>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nModule 1, “Security Concepts,” covers the cybersecurity fundamentals, including the CIA Triad, comparing the various security deployments, understanding threat intelligence, malware analysis tools, RBA, and reverse engineering. It then moves into more in-depth concepts such as risk assessment, threats, vulnerabilities, and exploits. The module gets into the details of the access control process and the various types of attacks and vulnerabilities. The last lesson in Module 1 digs into the fundamentals of cryptography and the Public Key Infrastructure, or PKI. The encryption and hashing algorithms are explained, as well as the secure socket layer and digital certificates.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nModule 2, “Security Monitoring,” starts with the fundamentals: data normalization and the 5-tuple correlation, as well as DNS, weblog, deterministic, and probabilistic analysis. NetFlow as it specifically applies to cybersecurity and incident response is introduced in this module, as well as its various analysis tools. You will learn how to identify the different intrusion event categories, and gain an understanding of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Framework.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nModule 3, “Host-based Analysis,” gets into the details of digital forensics, including types of evidence and the chain of custody. It then details more of the host-based forensics of Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX. This module finishes with a discussion of endpoint security technologies, including firewalls, antimalware, antivirus, and systems-based sandboxing.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nModule 4, “Network Intrusion Analysis,” digs into the various ways to determine whether your system has been attacked, from examining packet captures and protocol headers, to monitoring traffic, and differentiating between true and false negatives. Module 4 will walk you through all the details.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nModule 5, “Security Policies and Procedures,” covers the security management side of security, including the management of assets, configuration, mobile devices, patches, and vulnerabilities, as well as explaining PII and PHI. The next lesson covers the fundamentals of incident response, including the scope of the plan and processes, how to share information and coordinate with partners, whether your company aligns with the NIST IR categories, and the structures of the incident response teams. Lastly, this module introduces the VERIS Schema and how it applies to incident response.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>About Pearson Video Training</strong>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nPearson publishes expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

    "description": "<span><p><strong>Information Security Policies, Procedures, and Standards: A Practitioner's Reference</strong> gives you a blueprint on how to develop effective information security policies and procedures. It uses standards such as NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, and COBIT, and regulations such as HIPAA and PCI DSS as the foundation for the content. Highlighting key terminology, policy development concepts and methods, and suggested document structures, it includes examples, checklists, sample policies and procedures, guidelines, and a synopsis of the applicable standards.</p><p>The author explains how and why procedures are developed and implemented rather than simply provide information and examples. This is an important distinction because no two organizations are exactly alike; therefore, no two sets of policies and procedures are going to be exactly alike. This approach provides the foundation and understanding you need to write effective policies, procedures, and standards clearly and concisely.</p><p>Developing policies and procedures may seem to be an overwhelming task. However, by relying on the material presented in this book, adopting the policy development techniques, and examining the examples, the task will not seem so daunting. You can use the discussion material to help sell the concepts, which may be the most difficult aspect of the process. Once you have completed a policy or two, you will have the courage to take on even more tasks. Additionally, the skills you acquire will assist you in other areas of your professional and private life, such as expressing an idea clearly and concisely or creating a project plan.</p></span>",

To create a secure IT environment, many steps must be taken, but not all steps are created equal. There are technological measures that increase security, and some that do not do, but overall, the best defense is to create a culture of security in the organization. The same principles that guide IT security in the enterprise guide smaller organizations and individuals. The individual techniques and tools may vary by size, but everyone with a computer needs to turn on a firewall and have antivirus software. Personal information should be safeguarded by individuals and by the firms entrusted with it.  As organizations and people develop security plans and put the technical pieces in place, a system can emerge that is greater than the sum of its parts.<br/></p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><span><span><p/><p><strong>Successful cyberattacks can damage your organisation, no matter who is behind them</strong></p><p>The goals of the cyberterrorist, the cybercriminal, the cyberactivist and the state-sponsored hacker may not be the same – but the outcomes can be equally devastating. Each can cause serious challenges for your organisation, ranging from information theft and disruption of normal operations to loss of reputation or credibility.</p><p><strong>Cyber security is much more than technology</strong></p><p>Many books on cybersecurity focus on technical responses to these threats. As important as this is, human fallibility and other known vulnerabilities will still allow hackers to easily break into a system that has not taken account of these factors.</p><p><em>CyberWar, CyberTerror, CyberCrime and CyberActivism</em> encourages cybersecurity professionals to take a wider view of what cybersecurity means, and to make the most of international standards and best practices to create a culture of cybersecurity awareness within their organizations that complements their technology-based defences.</p><p><strong>A cyber aware workforce equals better security</strong></p><p>This second edition takes a deep look at the changing threats in the cyber landscape, and includes an updated body of knowledge that describes how to acquire, develop, and sustain a secure information environment that goes beyond technology. This enables you to move towards a cyber aware organisational culture that is more robust and better able to deal with a wider range of threats. Related references, as well as recommendations for additional reading, are included at the end of each chapter making this a valuable resource for trainers, researchers and cybersecurity practitioners.</p><p><strong>Order this book today and see how international standards can boost your cyber defences</strong></p><p><strong>About the author</strong></p><p>Dr Julie Mehan is the Founder and President of JEMStone Strategies and a Principal in a strategic consulting firm in the State of Virginia. She has delivered cybersecurity and related privacy services to senior commercial, department of defence and federal government clients working in Italy, Australia, Canada, Belgium, and the United States.

    "description": "<span><span><span><p/><p><strong>A concise and practical guide to mobile security</strong></p><p>This pocket guide gives you clear and reliable guidance on how to protect the information contained in your mobile phone.</p><p>Written by one of the country's top academic experts on information security, the guide covers such topics as safeguarding data through encryption, establishing a virtual private network (VPN) to create a secure way for your staff to connect to the server on a remote device, and countering the growing threat on mobile platforms of SMS-phishing and malware. </p><p>Rather than trying to ban the Blackberry, the solution proposed is for organisations to factor mobile devices into their overall information security policy.</p><p>The recommendations contained in this pocket guide are designed to enable your organisation to enjoy the benefits of mobile phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs) without sacrificing the ability to operate as safely and securely as possible.</p><p>The key themes tackled in this pocket guide are:</p><ul><li>The importance of mobile technologies</li><li>Physical threats in the outside world</li><li>Dealing with network connectivity</li><li>Authenticating the user</li><li>Mechanisms for protecting mobile data</li><li>Attacks facing mobile devices and users</li><li>The potential limitations of mobile security features.</li></ul><h3>Safeguard sensitive information</h3>\nA simple way to protect the information on a mobile in the event of loss or theft is to use password protection. Without it, anyone who gets hold of the device has a free hand to browse its contents. Choosing and using a strong password is just as important on your mobile as it is for your desktop.\n<h3>Use encryption to protect mobile security</h3>\n\t\t\t<p>With a mobile, data is often held on secure digital (SD) cards rather than in the device's onboard memory. By encrypting the data, you can prevent thieves from accessing the contents of your SD cards. </p>\n\t\t\t<h3>Define the boundries of mobile usage</h3>\n\t\t\t<p>Personal devices hold a lot of corporate data that simply should not be there in the first place. By setting up proper technical controls, you can regulate what material your staff are permitted to take out of the office on their mobile phones.</p>\n\t\t\t<h3>Viruses on mobile platforms</h3>\n\t\t\t<p>Attackers are taking an increasing interest in mobile platforms, so providing some level of anti-virus protection for handheld devices is increasingly recommended. With the anti-virus software on your desktop, you can connect up your mobile and give it a virus scan. </p>\n\t\t\t<p>Forewarned is forearmed, and with the expert guidance contained in this pocket guide you can retain the advantages associated with this new technology while ensuring that your confidential information will stay confidential.</p>\n</span></span></span>",

Of course you have, whether you knew it or not.</p><p>Ever caught a spouse, business partner, parent, boss, or child brazenly lying right to your face? What if you could tell someone was lying, just by listening to them, and observing their action and behavior?</p><p>How to Spot a Liar is the first book that gives you the tools to figure out what’s really going on: to gain the upper hand in salary negotiation, move a prospective client toward the outcome you desire, and find out why you need to end a business or personal relationship.</p><p>Author Greg Hartley is a decorated military interrogator who has used the techniques in How to Spot a Liar for 16 years to get the truth from enemy combatants. He has successfully applied them to project management and in contract negotiations, to resolve conflict and prevail. Now he shares this scientific process with you so you can use it every day.</p><p>Who needs How to Spot a Liar? Anyone with a cheating spouse or manipulative boss. Anyone conducting job interviews or cold-calling prospective customers. Lawyers who need to “read” witnesses or jurors. Anyone trying to survive the dating scene or faced with a string of business meetings with clients. Anyone who has teenagers at home or works on Capitol Hill. Anyone whose success and happiness depends on clear interaction with others.</p><p>And anyone who wants to become just a bit more inscrutable, in business, life...even at the poker table!</p><p>Gregory Hartley’s expertise as an interrogator first earned him honors with the United States Army. More recently, it has drawn organizations such as the Defense Intelligence Agency, Navy SEALS, Federal law enforcement agencies, and national TV to seek his insights about “how to” as well as “why.” He resides near Atlanta, Georgia.</p><p>Maryann Karinch is the author of eight books, including Rangers Lead the Way: The Army Rangers’ Guide to Leading Your Organization Through Chaos (with Dean Hohl) and founder of The Rudy Agency, a literary agency based in Estes Park, Colorado</p></span></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>If you are a network administrator, you're under a lot of pressure to ensure that mission-critical systems are completely safe from malicious code, buffer overflows, stealth port scans, SMB probes, OS fingerprinting attempts, CGI attacks, and other network intruders. Designing a reliable way to detect intruders before they get in is an essential--but often overwhelming--challenge. Snort, the defacto open source standard of intrusion detection tools, is capable of performing real-time traffic analysis and packet logging on IP network. It can perform protocol analysis, content searching, and matching. Snort can save countless headaches; the new <i>Snort Cookbook</i> will save countless hours of sifting through dubious online advice or wordy tutorials in order to leverage the full power of SNORT.Each recipe in the popular and practical problem-solution-discussion O'Reilly cookbook format contains a clear and thorough description of the problem, a concise but complete discussion of a solution, and real-world examples that illustrate that solution. The <i>Snort Cookbook</i> covers important issues that sys admins and security pros will us everyday, such as:</p><ul><li>installation</li><li>optimization</li><li>logging</li><li>alerting</li><li>rules and signatures</li><li>detecting viruses</li><li>countermeasures</li><li>detecting common attacks</li><li>administration</li><li>honeypots</li><li>log analysis</li></ul>But the <i>Snort Cookbook</i> offers far more than quick cut-and-paste solutions to frustrating security issues. Those who learn best in the trenches--and don't have the hours to spare to pore over tutorials or troll online for best-practice snippets of advice--will find that the solutions offered in this ultimate Snort sourcebook not only solve immediate problems quickly, but also showcase the best tips and tricks they need to master be security gurus--and still have a life.</div></span>",

Security remains crucial from the earliest phases of application design and development through deployment and support. Rather than bolting on a few security tests at the end of the process, many teams today are shifting security left by using tools and processes to address security from the earliest phases of the pipeline.</p><p>In this report, author Peter Conrad explains why \"shifting left\" is important and how you can apply this practice in your organization. Once you understand the challenges companies face under pressure to deliver applications faster and more securely, you'll be able to create security recommendations for your own organization--including strategies for making security a top priority for everyone.</p><p>This report helps you:</p><ul><li>Understand how DevSecOps integrates security as necessity within DevOps, placing security at the center of application development</li><li>Embed security by design throughout the entire software development lifecycle by shifting security left</li><li>Learn how traditional tools can help protect clusters, containers, and microservices</li><li>Explore case studies that demonstrate how a European bank, an energy company, and a telecommunications company successfully shifted left</li></ul></div></span></span>",

The book details how to use the tools and how to interpret them. <i>Network Performance Security: Testing and Analyzing Using Open Source and Low-Cost Tools</i> begins with an overview of best practices for testing security and performance across devices and the network. It then shows how to document assets—such as servers, switches, hypervisor hosts, routers, and firewalls—using publicly available tools for network inventory. </p><p><i> </i></p><p>The book explores security zoning the network, with an emphasis on isolated entry points for various classes of access. It shows how to use open source tools to test network configurations for malware attacks, DDoS, botnet, rootkit and worm attacks, and concludes with tactics on how to prepare and execute a mediation schedule of the who, what, where, when, and how, when an attack hits.</p><p>Network security is a requirement for any modern IT infrastructure. Using <i>Network Performance Security: Testing and Analyzing Using Open Source and Low-Cost Tools</i> makes the network stronger by using a layered approach of practical advice and good testing practices.</p><ul><li>Offers coherent, consistent guidance for those tasked with securing the network within an organization and ensuring that it is appropriately tested</li><li>Focuses on practical, real world implementation and testing</li><li>Employs a vetted \"security testing by example\" style to demonstrate best practices and minimize false positive testing</li><li>Gives practical advice for securing BYOD devices on the network, how to test and defend against internal threats, and how to continuously validate a firewall device, software, and configuration</li><li>Provides analysis in addition to step by step methodologies</li></ul></span>",

He helps you\nunderstand security as a systems problem, including the role of the\nall-important human element, and shows you how to match your\ncountermeasures to actual threats. You’ll learn how to move\nbeyond last year’s checklists at a time when technology is\nchanging so rapidly.</p><p>You’ll also understand how to design\nsecurity architectures that don’t just prevent attacks\nwherever possible, but also deal with the consequences of failures.\nAnd, within the context of your coherent architecture, you’ll\nlearn how to decide when to invest in a new security product and\nwhen not to.</p><p>Bellovin, co-author of the best-selling\nFirewalls and Internet Security, caught his first hackers in 1971.\nDrawing on his deep experience, he shares actionable, up-to-date\nguidance on issues ranging from SSO and federated authentication to\nBYOD, virtualization, and cloud security.</p><p>Perfect security is impossible.\nNevertheless, it’s possible to build and operate security\nsystems far more effectively. <b><em><b>Thinking\nSecurity</b></em></b> will help you do just that.</p></span></span>",

Written by an expert in both government and corporate vulnerability and security operations, this guide helps you understand the principles of the space and look beyond the individual technologies of the moment to develop durable comprehensive solutions. Numerous real-world examples illustrate the offensive and defensive concepts at work, including Conficker, Stuxnet, the Target compromise, and more. You will find clear guidance toward strategy, tools, and implementation, with practical advice on blocking systematic computer espionage and the theft of information from governments, companies, and individuals.</p><p>Assaults and manipulation of computer networks are rampant around the world. One of the biggest challenges is fitting the ever-increasing amount of information into a whole plan or framework to develop the right strategies to thwart these attacks. This book clears the confusion by outlining the approaches that work, the tools that work, and resources needed to apply them.</p><ul><li>Understand the fundamental concepts of computer network exploitation</li><li>Learn the nature and tools of systematic attacks</li><li>Examine offensive strategy and how attackers will seek to maintain their advantage</li><li>Understand defensive strategy, and how current approaches fail to change the strategic balance</li></ul><p>Governments, criminals, companies, and individuals are all operating in a world without boundaries, where the laws, customs, and norms previously established over centuries are only beginning to take shape. Meanwhile computer espionage continues to grow in both frequency and impact. This book will help you mount a robust offense or a strategically sound defense against attacks and exploitation. For a clear roadmap to better network security, <i>Network Attacks and Exploitation</i> is your complete and practical guide.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><b>Provides extensive coverage of standardized QoS technologies for fixed and mobile ultra-broadband networks and services—bringing together technical, regulation, and business aspects</b></p><p>The Quality of Service (QoS) has been mandatory for traditional telecommunication services such as telephony (voice) and television (TV) since the first half of the past century, however, with the convergence of telecommunication networks and services onto Internet technologies, the QoS provision remains a big challenge for all ICT services, not only for traditional ones. This book covers the standardized QoS technologies for fixed and mobile ultra-broadband networks and services, including the business aspects and QoS regulation framework, which all will have high impact on the ICTs in the current and the following decade.</p><p><i>QoS for Fixed and Mobile Ultra-Broadband</i> starts by introducing readers to the telecommunications field and the technology, and the many aspects of both QoS and QoE (Quality of Experience). The next chapter devotes itself to Internet QoS, starting with an overview of numerous technology protocols and finishing with business and regulatory aspects. The next three chapters look at QoS in NGN and Future Networks, QoS for fixed ultra-broadband, and QoS for mobile ultra-broadband. The book also provides readers with in-depth accounts of services in fixed and mobile ultra-broadband; broadband QoS parameters, KPIs, and measurements; network neutrality; and the QoS regulatory framework.</p><ul><li>Comprehensively covers every aspect of QoS technology for fixed and mobile ultra-broadband networks and services, including the technology, the many regulations, and their applications in business</li><li>Explains how the QoS is transiting from the traditional telecom world to an all-IP world</li><li>Presents all the fundamentals of QoS regulation, as well as SLA regulation</li></ul><p><i>QoS for Fixed and Mobile Ultra-Broadband</i> is an excellent resource for managers, engineers, and employees from regulators, ICT government organizations, telecommunication companies (operators, service providers), ICT companies, and industry. It is also a good book for students and professors from academia who are interested in understanding, implementation, and regulation of QoS for fixed and mobile ultra-broadband.  </p></span>",

This is\nnecessary due to increased attack frequency, diverse attack\nsophistication, and the rapid nature of attack velocity—all\nblurring the boundaries between the network and perimeter.</p><p><em>End-to-End Network Security</em> is\ndesigned to counter the new generation of complex threats. Adopting\nthis robust security strategy defends against highly sophisticated\nattacks that can occur at multiple locations in your network. The\nultimate goal is to deploy a set of security capabilities that\ntogether create an intelligent, self-defending network that\nidentifies attacks as they occur, generates alerts as appropriate,\nand then automatically responds.</p><p><em>End-to-End Network Security</em> provides\nyou with a comprehensive look at the mechanisms to counter threats\nto each part of your network. The book starts with a review of\nnetwork security technologies then covers the six-step methodology\nfor incident response and best practices from proactive security\nframeworks. Later chapters cover wireless network security, IP\ntelephony security, data center security, and IPv6 security.\nFinally, several case studies representing small, medium, and large\nenterprises provide detailed example configurations and\nimplementation strategies of best practices learned in earlier\nchapters.</p><p>Adopting the techniques and strategies\noutlined in this book enables you to prevent day-zero attacks,\nimprove your overall security posture, build strong policies, and\ndeploy intelligent, self-defending networks.</p><p>“Within these pages, you will find\nmany practical tools, both process related and technology related,\nthat you can draw on to improve your risk mitigation\nstrategies.”</p><p>—Bruce Murphy, Vice President, World\nWide Security Practices, Cisco</p><p>Omar Santos is a senior network security\nengineer at Cisco®. Omar has designed, implemented, and\nsupported numerous secure networks for Fortune 500 companies and\nthe U.S. government.

This book explores the participants, battlefields, and the tools and techniques used during today's digital conflicts. The concepts discussed will give students of information security a better idea of how cyber conflicts are carried out now, how they will change in the future, and how to detect and defend against espionage, hacktivism, insider threats and non-state actors such as organized criminals and terrorists.</p><p>Every one of our systems is under attack from multiple vectors - our defenses must be ready all the time and our alert systems must detect the threats every time. This book provides concrete examples and real-world guidance on how to identify and defend a network against malicious attacks. It considers relevant technical and factual information from an insider's point of view, as well as the ethics, laws and consequences of cyber war and how computer criminal law may change as a result. Starting with a definition of cyber warfare, the book’s 15 chapters discuss the following topics: the cyberspace battlefield; cyber doctrine; cyber warriors; logical, physical, and psychological weapons; computer network exploitation; computer network attack and defense; non-state actors in computer network operations; legal system impacts; ethics in cyber warfare; cyberspace challenges; and the future of cyber war.</p><p>This book is a valuable resource to those involved in cyber warfare activities, including policymakers, penetration testers, security professionals, network and systems administrators, and college instructors. The information provided on cyber tactics and attacks can also be used to assist in developing improved and more efficient procedures and technical defenses.

    "description": "<span><span><p>When it comes to network security, many users and administrators are running scared, and justifiably so.  The sophistication of attacks against computer systems increases with each new Internet worm.What's the worst an attacker can do to you?  You'd better find out, right?  That's what <i>Security Warrior</i> teaches you.  Based on the principle that the only way to defend yourself is to understand your attacker in depth, <i>Security Warrior</i> reveals how your systems can be attacked.  Covering everything from reverse engineering to SQL attacks, and including topics like social engineering, antiforensics, and common attacks against UNIX and Windows systems, this book teaches you to know your enemy and how to be prepared to do battle.<i>Security Warrior</i> places particular emphasis on reverse engineering.  RE is a fundamental skill for the administrator, who must be aware of all kinds of malware that can be installed on his machines -- trojaned binaries, \"spyware\" that looks innocuous but that sends private data back to its creator, and more.  This is the only book to discuss reverse engineering for Linux or Windows CE.  It's also the only book that shows you how SQL injection works, enabling you to inspect your database and web applications for vulnerability.<i>Security Warrior</i> is the most comprehensive and up-to-date book covering the art of computer war: attacks against computer systems and their defenses.  It's often scary, and never comforting.  If you're on the front lines, defending your site against attackers, you need this book.  On your shelf--and in your hands.</p></span></span>",

Yuan, Zoom Video Communications<br/><br/></b>There is much publicity regarding network security, but the real cyber Achilles’ heel is insecure software. Millions of software vulnerabilities create a cyber house of cards, in which we conduct our digital lives. In response, security people build ever more elaborate cyber fortresses to protect this vulnerable software. Despite their efforts, cyber fortifications consistently fail to protect our digital treasures. Why? The security industry has failed to engage fully with the creative, innovative people who write software.<br/><br/><b>Core Software Security </b>expounds developer-centric software security, a holistic process to engage creativity for security. As long as software is developed by humans, it requires the human element to fix it. <em>Developer-centric security</em> is not only feasible but also cost effective and operationally relevant. The methodology builds security into software development, which lies at the heart of our cyber infrastructure. Whatever development method is employed, software must be secured at the <em>source</em><strong>. </strong></p><p><strong>Book Highlights:</strong></p><ul><p>\n</p><li>Supplies a practitioner's view of the SDL </li><li>Considers Agile as a security enabler</li><li>Covers the privacy elements in an SDL</li><li>Outlines a holistic business-savvy SDL framework that includes people, process, and technology</li><li>Highlights the key success factors, deliverables, and metrics for each phase of the SDL</li><li>Examines cost efficiencies, optimized performance, and organizational structure of a developer-centric software security program and PSIRT</li><li>Includes a chapter by noted security architect Brook Schoenfield who shares his insights and experiences in applying the book’s SDL framework </li></ul><p>View the authors' website at http://www.androidinsecurity.com/</p></span>",

Risks come in many varieties, and there is a growing concern for organizations to respond to the challenge. Businesses can be severely impacted by natural and man-made disasters including: floods, earthquakes, tsunami, environmental threats, terrorism, supply chain risks, pandemics, and white-collar crime. An organization’s resilience is dependent not only on their own system security and infrastructure, but also on the wider infrastructure providing health and safety, utilities, transportation, and communication.</p><p/><p>Developments in risk security and management knowledge offer a path towards resilience and recovery through effective leadership in crisis situations. The growing body of knowledge in research and methodologies is a basis for decisions to safeguard people and assets, and to ensure the survivability of an organization from a crisis. Not only can businesses become more secure through risk management, but an effective program can also facilitate innovation and afford new opportunities.</p><p/><p>With chapters written by an international selection of leading experts, this book fills a crucial gap in our current knowledge of risk, crisis and security in business by exploring a broad spectrum of topics in the field. Edited by a globally-recognized expert on risk, this book is a vital reference for researchers, professionals and students with an interest in current scholarship in this expanding discipline.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Companies are investing an unprecedented amount of money to keep their data and assets safe, yet cyberattacks are on the rise-and the problem is worsening. No amount of technology, resources, or policies will reverse this trend. Only sound governance, originating with the board, can turn the tide.</p>\n\n<p>Protection against cyberattacks can't be treated as a problem solely belonging to an IT or cybersecurity department. It needs to cast a wide and impenetrable net that covers everything an organization does-from its business operations, models, and strategies to its products and intellectual property. And boards are in the best position to oversee the needed changes to strategy and hold their companies accountable. Not surprisingly, many boards aren't prepared to assume this responsibility.</p>\n\n<p>In A Leader's Guide to Cybersecurity, Thomas Parenty and Jack Domet, who've spent over three decades in the field, present a timely, clear-eyed, and actionable framework that will empower senior executives and board members to become stewards of their companies' cybersecurity activities. Filled with tools, best practices, and strategies, A Leader's Guide to Cybersecurity will help boards navigate this seemingly daunting but extremely necessary transition.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Use the methodology in this study guide to design, manage, and operate a balanced enterprise cybersecurity program that is pragmatic and realistic in the face of resource constraints and other real-world limitations. This guide is an instructional companion to the book <i>Enterprise Cybersecurity: How to Build a Successful Cyberdefense Program Against Advanced Threats</i>. The study guide will help you understand the book’s ideas and put them to work. The guide can be used for self-study or in the classroom.</p><p>Enterprise cybersecurity is about implementing a cyberdefense program that will succeed in defending against real-world attacks. While we often know what should be done, the resources to do it often are not sufficient. The reality is that the Cybersecurity Conundrum—what the defenders request, what the frameworks specify, and what the budget allows versus what the attackers exploit—gets in the way of what needs to be done. Cyberattacks in the headlines affecting millions of people show that this conundrum fails more often than we would prefer.</p><p>Cybersecurity professionals want to implement more than what control frameworks specify, and more than what the budget allows. Ironically, another challenge is that even when defenders get everything that they want, clever attackers are extremely effective at finding and exploiting the gaps in those defenses, regardless of their comprehensiveness. Therefore, the cybersecurity challenge is to spend the available budget on the right protections, so that real-world attacks can be thwarted without breaking the bank.</p><p>People involved in or interested in successful enterprise cybersecurity can use this study guide to gain insight into a comprehensive framework for coordinating an entire enterprise cyberdefense program.</p><div><b>What You’ll Learn</b><br/></div><ul><li>Know      the methodology of targeted attacks and why they succeed</li><li>Master      the cybersecurity risk management process</li><li>Understand      why cybersecurity capabilities are the foundation of effective cyberdefenses</li><li>Organize      a cybersecurity program's policy, people, budget, technology, and assessment</li><li>Assess      and score a cybersecurity program</li><li>Report      cybersecurity program status against compliance and regulatory frameworks</li><li>Use      the operational processes and supporting information systems of a      successful cybersecurity program</li><li>Create      a data-driven and objectively managed cybersecurity program</li><li>Discover      how cybersecurity is evolving and will continue to evolve over the next      decade</li></ul><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>Those involved in or interested in successful enterprise cybersecurity (e.g., business professionals, IT professionals, cybersecurity professionals, and students).

In today’s landscape, organizations need to acquire and develop effective security tools and mechanisms – not only to keep up with cyber criminals, but also to stay one step ahead.<br/> <br/> Cyber-Vigilance and Digital Trust develops cyber security disciplines that serve this double objective, dealing with cyber security threats in a unique way. Specifically, the book reviews recent advances in cyber threat intelligence, trust management and risk analysis, and gives a formal and technical approach based on a data tainting mechanism to avoid data leakage in Android systems\n   \n  </span>",

While the Smart Grid has provided increased efficiencies in monitoring power usage, directing power supplies to serve peak power needs and improving efficiency of power delivery, the Smart Grid has also opened the way for information security breaches and other types of security breaches. Potential threats range from meter manipulation to directed, high-impact attacks on critical infrastructure that could bring down regional or national power grids. It is essential that security measures are put in place to ensure that the Smart Grid does not succumb to these threats and to safeguard this critical infrastructure at all times.</p><p>Dr. Florian Skopik is one of the leading researchers in Smart Grid security, having organized and led research consortia and panel discussions in this field. <i><b>Smart Grid Security</b></i>will provide the first truly holistic view of leading edge Smart Grid security research. This book does not focus on vendor-specific solutions, instead providing a complete presentation of forward-looking research in all areas of Smart Grid security. The book will enable practitioners to learn about upcoming trends, scientists to share new directions in research, and government and industry decision-makers to prepare for major strategic decisions regarding implementation of Smart Grid technology.</p><ul><li>Presents the most current and leading edge research on Smart Grid security from a holistic standpoint, featuring a panel of top experts in the field.</li><li>Includes coverage of risk management, operational security, and secure development of the Smart Grid.</li><li>Covers key technical topics, including threat types and attack vectors, threat case studies, smart metering, smart home, e- mobility, smart buildings, DERs, demand response management, distribution grid operators, transmission grid operators, virtual power plants, resilient architectures, communications protocols and encryption, as well as physical security.</li></ul></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Cyber attacks perpetrated against businesses, governments, organizations, and individuals have been occurring for decades. Many attacks are discovered only after the data has been exploited or sold on the criminal markets. Cyber attacks damage both the finances and reputations of businesses and cause damage to the ultimate victims of the crime. From the perspective of the criminal, the current state of inconsistent security policies and lax investigative procedures is a profitable and low-risk opportunity for cyber attacks. They can cause immense harm to individuals or businesses online and make large sums of money-safe in the knowledge that the victim will rarely report the matter to the police. For those tasked with probing such crimes in the field, information on investigative methodology is scarce.</p>\n\n<p>While there are high-quality manuals for conducting digital examinations on a device or network that has been hacked, the Cybercrime Investigators Handbook is the first guide on how to commence an investigation from the location the offence occurred and collect the evidence necessary to locate and prosecute the offender. This valuable contribution to the field teaches listeners to locate, lawfully seize, preserve, examine, interpret, and manage the technical evidence that is vital for effective cybercrime investigation.</p>\n\n<p></p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Discover the most prevalent cyber threats against individual users of all kinds of computing devices. This book teaches you the defensive best practices and state-of-the-art tools available to you to repel each kind of threat.</p><p><i>Personal Cybersecurity</i> addresses the needs of individual users at work and at home. This book covers personal cybersecurity for all modes of personal computing whether on consumer-acquired or company-issued devices: desktop PCs, laptops, mobile devices, smart TVs, WiFi and Bluetooth peripherals, and IoT objects embedded with network-connected sensors. In all these modes, the frequency, intensity, and sophistication of cyberattacks that put individual users at risk are increasing in step with accelerating mutation rates of malware and cybercriminal delivery systems.</p><p>Traditional anti-virus software and personal firewalls no longer suffice to guarantee personal security. Users who neglect to learn and adopt the new ways of protecting themselves in their work and private environments put themselves, their associates, and their companies at risk of inconvenience, violation, reputational damage, data corruption, data theft, system degradation, system destruction, financial harm, and criminal disaster. This book shows what actions to take to limit the harm and recover from the damage.</p><p>Instead of laying down a code of \"thou shalt not\" rules that admit of too many exceptions and contingencies to be of much practical use, cloud expert Marvin Waschke equips you with the battlefield intelligence, strategic understanding, survival training, and proven tools you need to intelligently assess the security threats in your environment and most effectively secure yourself from attacks. Through instructive examples and scenarios, the author shows you how to adapt and apply best practices to your own particular circumstances, how to automate and routinize your personal cybersecurity, how to recognize security breaches and act swiftly to seal them, and how to recover losses and restore functionality when attacks succeed.</p><p><b>What You'll Learn</b></p><ul><li><p>Discover how computer security works and what it can protect us from</p></li><li><p>See how a typical hacker attack works</p></li><li><p>Evaluate computer security threats to the individual user and corporate systems</p></li><li><p>Identify the critical vulnerabilities of a computer connected to the Internet</p></li><li><p>Manage your computer to reduce vulnerabilities to yourself and your employer</p></li><li><p>Discover how the adoption of newer forms of biometric authentication affects you</p></li><li><p>Stop your router and other online devices from being co-opted into disruptive denial of service attacks</p></li></ul><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>Proficient and technically knowledgeable computer users who are anxious about cybercrime and want to understand the technology behind both attack and defense but do not want to go so far as to become security experts. Some of this audience will be purely home users, but many will be executives, technical managers, developers, and members of IT departments who need to adopt personal practices for their own safety and the protection of corporate systems. Many will want to impart good cybersecurity practices to their colleagues. IT departments tasked with indoctrinating their users with good safety practices may use the book as training material.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><span><span><span><p><b>A definitive guide to cybersecurity law</b></p><p>Expanding on the author’s experience as a cybersecurity lawyer and law professor, Cybersecurity Law is the definitive guide to cybersecurity law, with an in-depth analysis of U.S. and international laws that apply to data security, data breaches, sensitive information safeguarding, law enforcement surveillance, cybercriminal combat, privacy, and many other cybersecurity issues. Written in an accessible manner, the book provides real-world examples and case studies to help readers understand the practical applications of the presented material. The book begins by outlining the legal requirements for data security, which synthesizes the Federal Trade Commission’s cybersecurity cases in order to provide the background of the FTC’s views on data security. The book also examines data security requirements imposed by a growing number of state legislatures and private litigation arising from data breaches. Anti-hacking laws, such as the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, Economic Espionage Act, and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and how companies are able to fight cybercriminals while ensuring compliance with the U.S. Constitution and statutes are discussed thoroughly. Featuring an overview of the laws that allow coordination between the public and private sectors as well as the tools that regulators have developed to allow a limited amount of collaboration, this book also:</p><p>• Addresses current U.S. and international laws, regulations, and court opinions that define the field of cybersecurity including the security of sensitive information, such as financial data and health information</p><p>• Discusses the cybersecurity requirements of the largest U.S. trading partners in Europe, Asia, and Latin America, and specifically addresses how these requirements are similar to (and differ from) those in the U.S.</p><p>• Provides a compilation of many of the most important cybersecurity statutes and regulations</p><p>• Emphasizes the compliance obligations of companies with in-depth analysis of crucial U.S. and international laws that apply to cybersecurity issues</p><p>• Examines government surveillance laws and privacy laws that affect cybersecurity as well as each of the data breach notification laws in 47 states and the District of Columbia</p><p>• Includes numerous case studies and examples throughout to aid in classroom use and to help readers better understand the presented material</p><p>• Supplemented with a companion website that features in-class discussion questions and timely and recent updates on recent legislative developments as well as information on interesting cases on relevant and significant topics</p><p>Cybersecurity Law is appropriate as a textbook for undergraduate and graduate-level courses in cybersecurity, cybersecurity law, cyber operations, management-oriented information technology (IT), and computer science. This book is also an ideal reference for lawyers, IT professionals, government personnel, business managers, IT management personnel, auditors, and cybersecurity insurance providers.</p><p><b>JEFF KOSSEFF </b>is Assistant Professor of Cybersecurity Law at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. He frequently speaks and writes about cybersecurity and was a journalist covering technology and politics at The Oregonian, a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, and a recipient of the George Polk Award for national reporting.</p></span></span></span></span></span></span>",

This set of interconnected systems comprises the fundamental building blocks of the second economy -- the very foundation of our first economy. And adversaries, whether motivated by profit, principle or province, are singularly focused on winning the race through a relentless portfolio of shifting attack vectors.</p><p>Make no mistake about it, we are running a race. This is a race against a faceless, nameless adversary -- one that dictates the starting line, the rules of the road, and what trophies are at stake. Established assumptions must be challenged, strategies must be revised, and long-held practices must be upended to run this race and effectively compete.</p><p><i>The Second Economy</i> highlights a second to none approach in this fight, as the effectiveness and ROI of security solutions are increasingly measured by the business outcomes they enable.</p><p><b>What You'll Learn</b></p><ul><li><p>Understand the value of time and trust in a cyber-warfare world</p></li><li><p>Enable agile and intelligent organizations to minimize their risk of falling victim to the next attack</p></li><li><p>Accelerate response time by adopting a holistic approach</p></li><li><p>Eliminate friction across the threat defense lifecycle, from protection to detection to correction</p></li><li><p>Gain a sustainable competitive advantage by seizing first mover advantage</p></li><li><p>Deploy solutions across an open, integrated security framework</p></li></ul><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>Senior-level IT decision makers concerned with ascribing business value to a robust security strategy.

It informs readers through high-level summaries and the presentation of a consistent approach to several cyber-risk related domains, both from a civilian and a military perspective. Explaining fundamental principles in an interdisciplinary manner, it sheds light on the societal, economic, political, military, and technical issues related to the use and misuse of information and communication technologies.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p/><p>\n       The only guide on the market to cover IT Induction and Information Security Awareness!\n    </p><h3><strong>Where your information security is concerned, prevention is better than cure.</strong></h3>\n      If you want to tackle the problem of information security, you cannot rely on the help of technology alone. Information security breaches tend to occur as a result of human, as well as technological, failings. However, the human factor usually receives far less attention.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<strong>Training</strong>\n\t\t\t<p>\n       Computer systems are complex, so people who work with them often need to be trained in how to use them correctly. This applies especially to your company's information security. The loss of a memory stick by a careless employee, or the downloading of a file that contains a virus, may be all it takes to cause a security breach.\n    </p>\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Practical advice</strong></p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n       This book offers you practical advice on how to develop an IT Induction programme for your staff that can help safeguard your business information. By providing your employees with simple instruction in good IT working practices, and by making sure they know what is expected of them, you can strengthen your company's information security and reduce the risk that your data will be stolen or lost.\n    </p>\n\t\t\t<p><strong>A sense of responsibility</strong></p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n       Encouraging good corporate working and a strong sense of responsibility are, the author argues, essential for the protection of your business information. She shows you how to strike the right balance in your approach to staff training, thereby enabling you to provide your employees with an IT Induction that is at once informative and accessible.\n    </p>\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Benefits to business include:</strong></p>\n\t\t\t<ul><li><strong>Reduce the likelihood of a damaging security breach.</strong> Putting in place a programme of IT Induction will help ensure that your company's staff are following information security best practice.  Educating employees in good IT working practices will help them to avoid the errors that might otherwise put your organisation at risk.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Protect the company's reputation.</strong> The damage an information security breach can do to your business goes beyond the initial cost of clearing up the mess. Without proper staff training, the danger is that theft or loss of data will damage your company's reputation. You need to provide your staff with a proper IT Induction in order to preserve good relations with your customers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Avoid legal complications.</strong> IT offers business new, less formal means of communication. Employees write e-mails in a different style from the way they write letters. However, contracts can be made or broken via e-mail, and e-mail correspondence can be cited in litigation. An IT Induction programme will give your staff the appropriate guidance on e-mail communication with the clients or business partners of your company.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Manage employee working practices.</strong> Laptop computers and broadband mean that for many employees, the boundaries between work and home are becoming blurred. If you allow your staff to mix and match between working in the office and working from home, you need to make sure they know what they have to do to safeguard your firm's data both inside and outside the office.\n      </li></ul></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p/><p>Invaluable advice on information security in clear, accessible language!</p><p><strong>Are you making it too easy for online fraudsters to steal from your company?</strong></p><p>IT is opening up new opportunities for your business. It also offers rich pickings for the criminal.</p><p><strong>The new threat</strong></p><p>When legitimate business goes digital, organised crime cannot be far behind. So, once your business is connected to the Internet, you become vulnerable to a whole range of new threats. Hackers can break into your computer, using dictionary attacks or keystroke logging to seize the password to your email account. ; Criminals may send you emails in an attempt to trick you into downloading malicious software or to reveal your bank details. Online fraud may now be as valuable to organised crime as drug trafficking, and there are roughly 200,000 viruses, Trojans and worms circulating in cyberspace. All this means that in today's world, the bad guys are only a mouse-click away.</p><p><strong>What you can do</strong></p><p>Your business information is valuable, so it is in your interest to protect it. You also have a responsibility towards your customers. While information security breaches are costly in themselves, you also have to think about what exposing your customers to the danger of identity theft might do to your company's reputation. Sometimes these issues seem complex and bewildering. The good news is that you can take some simple steps that will help to secure your business's digital information. Common-sense precautions, like not leaving your laptop lying around in a public place, or protecting your wireless network with a firewall, make a real difference.</p><p><strong>Speaking your language</strong></p><p>If IT is not your speciality, and you are running a small business that is connected to the Internet, then this book is for you. The author steers clear of geek language, and offers you, in plain English, ten simple rules to keep you out of trouble online. The damage and losses that result from online fraud can run into thousands of pounds, so this could well be the most valuable books you ever buy!</p><p><strong>Benefits to business include:</strong></p><li><p><strong>Retain customer confidence</strong></p><p>    If you cannot protect your customer data, then you will leave it exposed to hackers and thieves. Breaches in your information security will not only alienate existing customers, but also scare other potential customers away. To protect the reputation of your company, you need to get up to speed on information security. </p></li><li><p><strong>Avoid fines and lawsuits</strong></p><p>    If you are running a business, you have a basic duty of care towards your customers. So if you adopt a lax approach towards protecting confidential information such as their bank details, then you can be accused of negligence. This means you could find yourself facing legal action from customers who have been made the victims of fraud. You may also be liable to a £5000 fine for failure to comply with the Data Protection Act. </p></li><li><p><strong>Protect your profits</strong></p><p>\n    When you are running a business, the money that the cybercriminal is trying to steal from you is money you cannot afford to lose. Let this guide show you what to do to stay one step ahead of the criminal, and then you can protect your profits. </p></li><li><p><strong>Get a grip on the problem</strong></p><p>\n    Your business uses IT, but your business is not all about IT. That is why this book is written for business people rather than for IT specialists, in language that you will find easy to follow. </p></li><p><strong>Get secure today - buy your copy of this essential guide for the smaller business right now!</strong></p></span></span></span>",

By treating information security like an\nordinary technological practice—that is, by throwing money, a\nhandful of the latest technologies, and a lineup of gurus at the\nproblem—they invariably wind up with expensive, but deeply\nflawed, solutions. The only way out of this trap is to change one's\nway of thinking about security: to grasp the reasoning, philosophy,\nand logic that underlie all successful security efforts.</p><p>In <em>Inside the Security Mind: Making the Tough Decisions</em>,\nsecurity expert Kevin Day teaches you how to approach information\nsecurity the way the top gurus do—as an art, rather than a\ncollection of technologies. By applying this discipline, your\nsolutions will be more secure and less burdensome in time, expense,\nand effort. The first part of the book explains the practice of\nbreaking security decisions down into a set of simple rules. These\nrules may then be applied to make solid security decisions in\nalmost any environment. In the second part, Day uses a series of\npractical examples to illustrate exactly how the discipline works\nin practice. Additional material covers:</p><ul><li><p>Designing an enterprise security plan, including\nperimeter/firewall and Internal defenses, application, system, and\nhardware security</p></li><li><p>Ongoing security measures—recurring audits, vulnerability\nmaintenance, logging and monitoring, and incident response, plus\nrisk assessment</p></li><li><p>Choosing between open source and proprietary solutions; and\nwired, wireless, and virtual private networks</p></li></ul><p>This book is essential reading for anyone working to keep\ninformation secure. Technical and non-technical IT professionals\nalike can apply Day's concepts and strategies to become security\ngurus, while seasoned practitioners will benefit from the unique\nand effective presentation of the essential security practices.</p></span></span></span></span></span>",

It addresses the steps organizations must take to address insider threats at a people, process, and technology level. <br/><br/>Today’s headlines are littered with news of identity thieves, organized cyber criminals, corporate espionage, nation-state threats, and terrorists. They represent the next wave of security threats but still possess nowhere near the devastating potential of the most insidious threat: the insider. This is not the bored 16-year-old hacker. We are talking about insiders like you and me, trusted employees with access to information - consultants, contractors, partners, visitors, vendors, and cleaning crews. Anyone in an organization’s building or networks that possesses some level of trust.<br/><br/>*  Full coverage of this hot topic for virtually every global 5000 organization, government agency, and individual interested in security.<br/><br/>*  Brian Contos is the Chief Security Officer for one of the most well known, profitable and respected security software companies in the U.S.—ArcSight.\n</span>",

    "description": "<span><div>Business scandals from Enron to WorldCom have escalated concerns about corporate governance into a full-blown crisis. Institutional investors and legislators have dominated the debate and enacted important changes in corporate accounting and other areas. But Colin B. Carter and Jay W. Lorsch say that we must now focus on the performance of corporate boards. This timely book argues that boards are being pressed to perform unrealistic duties given their traditional structure, processes, and membership. Carter and Lorsch propose a strategic redesign of boards--making them better attuned to their oversight, decision-making, and advisory roles--to enable directors to meet 21st century challenges successfully. Based on the authors' deep expertise and longtime experience working with boards around the world, and on a probing survey of CEOs, Carter and Lorsch help boards to develop a realistic value proposition customized to the company they serve. The authors explore the core dilemmas and responsibilities boards face and outline a framework for designing the most effective structure, makeup, size, and culture. This book provides a candid account of the current state of boards and points the way in a time of crisis and change.</div></span>",

    "description": "<span><i>A complete guide to the challenges and solutions in securing microservices architectures.</i><br/>\nMassimo Siani, FinDynamic<br/><br/>\n<p>Unlike traditional enterprise applications, Microservices applications are collections of independent components that function as a system. Securing the messages, queues, and API endpoints requires new approaches to security both in the infrastructure and the code. <i>Microservices Security in Action</i> teaches you how to address microservices-specific security challenges throughout the system. This practical guide includes plentiful hands-on exercises using industry-leading open-source tools and examples using Java and Spring Boot.</p>\n<h4>about the technology</h4>\n<p>Integrating independent services into a single system presents special security challenges in a microservices deployment. With proper planning, however, you can build in security from the start. Learn to create secure services and protect application data throughout development and deployment. As microservices continue to change enterprise application systems, developers and architects must learn to integrate security into their design and implementation. Because microservices are created as a system of independent components, each a possible point of failure, they can multiply the security risk. With proper planning, design, and implementation, you can reap the benefits of microservices while keeping your application data—and your company's reputation—safe!</p>\n<h4>about the book</h4>\n<p><i>Microservices Security in Action</i> is filled with solutions, teaching best practices for throttling and monitoring, access control, and microservice-to-microservice communications. Detailed code samples, exercises, and real-world use cases help you put what you've learned into production. Along the way, authors and software security experts Prabath Siriwardena and Nuwan Dias shine a light on important concepts like throttling, analytics gathering, access control at the API gateway, and microservice-to-microservice communication. You'll also discover how to securely deploy microservices using state-of-the-art technologies including Kubernetes, Docker, and the Istio service mesh. Lots of hands-on exercises secure your learning as you go, and this straightforward guide wraps up with a security process review and best practices. When you're finished reading, you'll be planning, designing, and implementing microservices applications with the priceless confidence that comes with knowing they're secure!</p>\n<h4>what's inside</h4>\n<ul><li>Microservice security concepts\n</li><li>Edge services with an API gateway\n</li><li>Deployments with Docker, Kubernetes, and Istio\n</li><li>Security testing at the code level\n</li><li>Communications with HTTP, gRPC, and Kafka\n</li></ul>\n<h4>about the audience</h4>\n<p>For experienced microservices developers with intermediate Java skills.</p>\n<h4>about the authors</h4>\n<p><b>Prabath Siriwardena</b> is the vice president of security architecture at WSO2. <b>Nuwan Dias</b> is the director of API architecture at WSO2.

    "description": "<span><div><p>Most security professionals don't have the words \"security\" or \"hacker\" in their job title. Instead, as a developer or admin you often have to fit in security alongside your official responsibilities - building and maintaining computer systems. Implement the basics of good security now, and you'll have a solid foundation if you bring in a dedicated security staff later. Identify the weaknesses in your system, and defend against the attacks most likely to compromise your organization, without needing to become a trained security professional.</p><p>Computer security is a complex issue. But you don't have to be an expert in all the esoteric details to prevent many common attacks. Attackers are opportunistic and won't use a complex attack when a simple one will do. You can get a lot of benefit without too much complexity, by putting systems and processes in place that ensure you aren't making the obvious mistakes. Secure your systems better, with simple (though not always easy) practices.</p><p>Plan to patch often to improve your security posture. Identify the most common software vulnerabilities, so you can avoid them when writing software. Discover cryptography - how it works, how easy it is to get wrong, and how to get it right. Configure your Windows computers securely. Defend your organization against phishing attacks with training and technical defenses.</p><p>Make simple changes to harden your system against attackers.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>You don't need any particular software to follow along with this book. Examples in the book describe security vulnerabilities and how to look for them. These examples will be more interesting if you have access to a code base you've worked on. Similarly, some examples describe network vulnerabilities and how to detect them. These will be more interesting with access to a network you support.</p></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>With the large number of high-profile incidents in the last few years, you’ve likely heard of ransomware attacks—a type of cybercrime where hackers use malware to encrypt network files, locking users out of the system until a ransom is paid. Within hours, a thriving business can completely lose access to its sensitive data. Business solutions company Tools &amp; Solutions survived a ransomware attack. Then, to prevent future attacks from succeeding, the company updated internal guidance, identified and documented vulnerabilities, and reviewed its backup strategy while critically aligning key stakeholders.</p><p>Join us for this Case Study with security pro Partha Majumdar to explore the steps Tools &amp; Solutions took following their ransomware incident and learn how to prevent ransomware attacks using a layered approach that combines security defenses with proactive measures to stop ransomware from taking hold in the first place. And if you run a distributed cloud system, you’ll get tips for your overall security strategy and specific techniques that will help you implement preventative, detective, incident response, and recovery controls.</p><p>Recorded on November 23, 2021.

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>Application security testing has been around for a long time, yet successful attacks continue despite significant investments in application security. And we shouldn’t be surprised when we’re applying testing tools developed more than 12 years ago to software development methods only made commonplace in the last 3–5 years. In addition, application security is least understood and often takes a back seat to perimeter and endpoint security. At the same time, there’s a misconception that the cloud provider takes care of all the security, and few people have considered new attack surfaces introduced by containers and orchestration. Tesla showed us the fallacy here.</p><p>Traditional application security testing has been targeted to security professionals and is regarded as a separate process from development. This separation and delay creates friction in the process, with many trade-offs required. In an effort to improve application security testing, the new chant has been “shift left” to remove more vulnerabilities earlier and empower the developers.</p><p>Lucas Charles (GitLab) examines the shortcomings of most shift-left efforts and how cloud native environments, Agile DevOps processes, and minimum viable products with rapid iteration wreaks havoc on traditional security methodologies. He dives into how to bring security into DevOps while avoiding a complex DevOps toolchain that must be integrated with security testing and explores new ways of thinking of app security to turn the industry on its head by using concurrent DevOps—a method that makes it possible for product, development, QA, security, and operations teams to work at the same time. You’ll learn the three key requirements of your application security process needed to get you onto the road of an efficient and secure software development lifecycle (SDLC).</p></div></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Around the world, users cost organizations billions of dollars due to simple errors and malicious actions. They believe that there is some deficiency in the users. In response, organizations believe that they have to improve their awareness efforts and making more secure users. This is like saying that coal mines should get healthier canaries. The reality is that it takes a multilayered approach that acknowledges that users will inevitably make mistakes or have malicious intent, and the failure is in not planning for that. It takes a holistic approach to assessing risk combined with technical defenses and countermeasures layered with a security culture and continuous improvement. Only with this kind of defense in depth can organizations hope to prevent the worst of the cybersecurity breaches and other user-initiated losses.</p>\n\n<p>Using lessons from tested and proven disciplines like military kill-chain analysis, counterterrorism analysis, industrial safety programs, and more, Ira Winkler and Dr. Tracy Celaya's You CAN Stop Stupid provides a methodology to analyze potential losses and determine appropriate countermeasures to implement. </p>\n\n<p>Business technology and security professionals will benefit from the information provided by these two well-known and influential cybersecurity speakers and experts.</p>\n\n<p></p></span>",

    "title": "Cryptography Apocalypse",
    "description": "<span><p><b>Will your organization be protected the day a quantum computer breaks encryption on the internet? </b></p><p>Computer encryption is vital for protecting users, data, and infrastructure in the digital age. Using traditional computing, even common desktop encryption could take decades for specialized ‘crackers’ to break and government and infrastructure-grade encryption would take <i>billions</i> of times longer. In light of these facts, it may seem that today’s computer cryptography is a rock-solid way to safeguard everything from online passwords to the backbone of the entire internet. Unfortunately, many current cryptographic methods will soon be obsolete. In 2016, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) predicted that quantum computers will soon be able to break the most popular forms of public key cryptography. The encryption technologies we rely on every day—HTTPS, TLS, WiFi protection, VPNs, cryptocurrencies, PKI, digital certificates, smartcards, and most two-factor authentication—will be virtually useless. . . unless you prepare. </p><p><i>Cryptography Apocalypse</i> is a crucial resource for every IT and InfoSec professional for preparing for the coming quantum-computing revolution. Post-quantum crypto algorithms are already a reality, but implementation will take significant time and computing power. This practical guide helps IT leaders and implementers make the appropriate decisions today to meet the challenges of tomorrow. This important book:</p><ul><li>Gives a simple quantum mechanics primer</li><li>Explains how quantum computing will break current cryptography</li><li>Offers practical advice for preparing for a post-quantum world</li><li>Presents the latest information on new cryptographic methods</li><li>Describes the appropriate steps leaders must take to implement existing solutions to guard against quantum-computer security threats </li></ul><p><i>Cryptography Apocalypse: Preparing for the Day When Quantum Computing Breaks Today's Crypto </i>is a must-have guide for anyone in the InfoSec world who needs to know if their security is ready for the day crypto break and how to fix it.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>As recently as five years ago, securing a network meant putting in a firewall, intrusion detection system, and installing antivirus software on the desktop. Unfortunately, attackers have grown more nimble and effective, meaning that traditional security programs are no longer effective.</p><p>Today's effective cyber security programs take these best practices and overlay them with intelligence. Adding cyber threat intelligence can help security teams uncover events not detected by traditional security platforms and correlate seemingly disparate events across the network. Properly-implemented intelligence also makes the life of the security practitioner easier by helping him more effectively prioritize and respond to security incidents.</p><p>The problem with current efforts is that many security practitioners don't know how to properly implement an intelligence-led program, or are afraid that it is out of their budget. <b><i>Building an Intelligence-Led Security Program</i></b> is the first book to show how to implement an intelligence-led program in your enterprise on any budget. It will show you how to implement a security information a security information and event management system, collect and analyze logs, and how to practice real cyber threat intelligence. You'll learn how to understand your network in-depth so that you can protect it in the best possible way.</p><ul><li>Provides a roadmap and direction on how to build an intelligence-led information security program to protect your company.</li><li>Learn how to understand your network through logs and client monitoring, so you can effectively evaluate threat intelligence.</li><li>Learn how to use popular tools such as BIND, SNORT, squid, STIX, TAXII, CyBox, and splunk to conduct network intelligence.</li></ul></span>",

Being a senior developer all but requires awareness of how those skills, along with their expected technical counterparts, mesh together through a project's life cycle. This book walks you through that discovery by going over the entire life cycle of a multi-tier system and its related software projects. You'll see what happens before any development takes place, and what impact the decisions and designs made at each step have on the development process. The development of the entire project, over the course of several iterations based on real-world Agile iterations, will be executed, sometimes starting from nothing, in one of the fastest growing languages in the world - Python. Application of practices in Python will be laid out, along with a number of Python-specific capabilities that are often overlooked. Finally, the book will implement a high-performance computing solution, from first principles through complete foundation.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Understand what happens over the course of a system's life (SDLC)\n</li><li>Establish what to expect from the pre-development life cycle steps\n</li><li>Find out how the development-specific phases of the SDLC affect development\n</li><li>Uncover what a real-world development process might be like, in an Agile way\n</li><li>Find out how to do more than just write the code\n</li><li>Identify the existence of project-independent best practices and how to use them\n</li><li>Find out how to design and implement a high-performance computing process\n</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>Hands-On Software Engineering with Python is for you if you are a developer having basic understanding of programming and its paradigms and want to skill up as a senior programmer.

It explores, in depth, the key technical, social, and legal issues at stake, and it provides readers with the information they need to advance research and development in this exciting area.  </p><p>Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are engineered systems that are built from, and depend upon the seamless integration of computational algorithms and physical components. Advances in CPS will enable capability, adaptability, scalability, resiliency, safety, security, and usability far in excess of what today’s simple embedded systems can provide. Just as the Internet revolutionized the way we interact with information, CPS technology has already begun to transform the way people interact with engineered systems. In the years ahead, smart CPS will drive innovation and competition across industry sectors, from agriculture, energy, and transportation, to architecture, healthcare, and manufacturing.  A priceless source of practical information and inspiration, <i>Security and Privacy in Cyber-Physical Systems: Foundations, Principles and Applications</i> is certain to have a profound impact on ongoing R&amp;D and education at the confluence of security, privacy, and CPS. </p></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>A recent survey from the Pew Research Center found that few Americans are confident about the security or privacy of their data—particularly when it comes to the use of online tools. As a web developer, you represent the first line of defense in protecting your user’s data and privacy. This report explores several techniques, tools, and best practices for developing and maintaining web apps that provide the privacy and security that every user needs—and deserves.</p><p>Each individual now produces more data every day than people in earlier generations did throughout their lifetimes. Every time we click, tweet, or visit a site, we leave a digital trace. As web developers, we’re responsible for shaping the experiences of users’ online lives. By making ethical, user-centered choices, we can create a better Web for everyone.</p><ul><li>Learn how web tracking works, and how you can provide users with greater privacy controls</li><li>Explore HTTPS and learn how to use this protocol to encrypt user connections</li><li>Use web development frameworks that provide baked-in security support for protecting user data</li><li>Learn methods for securing user authentication, and for sanitizing and validating user input</li><li>Provide exports that allow users to reclaim their data if and when you close your service</li></ul><p>This is the third report in the Ethical Web Development series from author Adam Scott.

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>In recent years, we’ve seen tremendous improvements in artificial intelligence, due to the advances of neural-based models. However, the more popular these algorithms and techniques get, the more serious the consequences of data and user privacy. These issues will drastically impact the future of AI research—specifically how neural-based models are developed, deployed, and evaluated.</p><p>Yishay Carmiel (IntelligentWire) shares techniques and explains how data privacy will impact machine learning development and how future training and inference will be affected. Yishay first dives into why training on private data should be addressed, federated learning, and differential privacy. He then discusses why inference on private data should be addressed, homomorphic encryption and neural networks, a polynomial approximation of neural networks, protecting data in neural networks, data reconstruction from neural networks, and methods and techniques to secure data reconstruction from neural networks.</p><p>This session was recorded at the 2019 O'Reilly Artificial Intelligence Conference in New York.</p></div></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p/><p>   Healthcare IT is the growth industry right now, and the need for guidance in regard to privacy and security is huge. Why? With new federal incentives and penalties tied to the HITECH Act, HIPAA, and the implementation of Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems, medical practices and healthcare systems are implementing new software at breakneck speed. Yet privacy and security considerations are often an afterthought, putting healthcare organizations at risk of fines and damage to their reputations.   </p><p><em>Healthcare Information Privacy and Security: Regulatory Compliance and Data Security in the Age of Electronic Health Records</em> outlines the new regulatory regime, and it also provides IT professionals with the processes and protocols, standards, and governance tools they need to maintain a secure and legal environment for data and records. It’s a concrete resource that will help you understand the issues affecting the law and regulatory compliance, privacy, and security in the enterprise.</p><p> As healthcare IT security expert Bernard Peter Robichau II shows, the success of a privacy and security initiative lies not just in proper planning but also in identifying who will own the implementation and maintain technologies and processes. From executive sponsors to system analysts and administrators, a properly designed security program requires that that the right people are assigned to the right tasks and have the tools they need. Robichau explains how to design and implement that program with an eye toward long-term success. Putting processes and systems in place is, of course, only the start. Robichau also shows how to manage your security program and maintain operational support including ongoing maintenance and policy updates. (Because regulations never sleep!)  </p><p> This book will help you devise solutions that include: </p><li>Identity and access management systems </li><li>Proper application design </li><li>Physical and environmental safeguards </li><li>Systemwide and client-based security configurations </li><li>Safeguards for patient data </li><li>Training and auditing procedures </li><li>Governance and policy administration  </li><em>Healthcare Information Privacy and Security</em> is the definitive guide to help you through the process of maintaining privacy and security in the healthcare industry. It will help you keep health information safe, and it will help keep your organization—whether local clinic or major hospital system—on the right side of the law. </span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><strong>Countering Cyber Sabotage: Introducing Consequence-Driven, Cyber-Informed Engineering (CCE)</strong> introduces a new methodology to help critical infrastructure owners, operators and their security practitioners make demonstrable improvements in securing their most important functions and processes.  </p><p>Current best practice approaches to cyber defense struggle to stop targeted attackers from creating potentially catastrophic results. From a national security perspective, it is not just the damage to the military, the economy, or essential critical infrastructure companies that is a concern. It is the cumulative, downstream effects from potential regional blackouts, military mission kills, transportation stoppages, water delivery or treatment issues, and so on. CCE is a validation that engineering first principles can be applied to the most important cybersecurity challenges and in so doing, protect organizations in ways current approaches do not. The most pressing threat is cyber-enabled sabotage, and CCE begins with the assumption that well-resourced, adaptive adversaries are already in and have been for some time, undetected and perhaps undetectable. </p><p>Chapter 1 recaps the current and near-future states of digital technologies in critical infrastructure and the implications of our near-total dependence on them. Chapters 2 and 3 describe the origins of the methodology and set the stage for the more in-depth examination that follows. Chapter 4 describes how to prepare for an engagement, and chapters 5-8 address each of the four phases. The CCE phase chapters take the reader on a more granular walkthrough of the methodology with examples from the field, phase objectives, and the steps to take in each phase. Concluding chapter 9 covers training options and looks towards a future where these concepts are scaled more broadly. </p><p></p></span>",

Many companies have turned to the popular defense-in-depth (DiD) technique, but this multilayered approach has its shortcomings. So where is the industry headed next? This insightful ebook demonstrates a new approach to DiD that enables current security tools to operate in concert rather than independently.</p><p>Stephen Gates, edge security evangelist and SME at Oracle Dyn, shows you how companies can establish integrated lines of defense similar to the way in which modern militaries operate on the battlefield. By the end of this book, CSOs, CISOs, security managers, and other professionals will understand how to implement the recommendations in this book today using the security technologies they already have in place.</p><p>With this ebook, you’ll examine:</p><ul><li>Why today’s security technologies alone aren’t enough to protect web applications</li><li>How the existing approach to DiD for cybersecurity falls short of its goals</li><li>An example of how the modern military uses integrated lines of defense that work in concert</li><li>Eight lines of defense—including edge routers, DDoS defenses, and WAFs—that are best for protecting cloud-based web applications</li><li>Ways to use automation and supervised machine learning to integrate your security approaches</li></ul></div></span></span>",

However, if we need security, we often feel as if we can never have enough. <b>Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach</b> provides security professionals with the ability to critically examine their organizational environment and make it secure while creating an optimal relationship between obtrusion and necessity. It stresses the benefits of using a methodical critical thinking process in building a comprehensive safety management system. </p><p/><p>The book provides a mechanism that enables readers to think clearly and critically about the process of security management, emphasizing the ability to articulate the differing aspects of business and security management by reasoning through complex problems in the changing organizational landscape. The authors elucidate the core security management competencies of planning, organizing, staffing, and leading while providing a process to critically analyze those functions. They specifically address information security, cyber security, energy-sector security, chemical security, and general security management utilizing a critical thinking framework. </p><p/><p>Going farther than other books available regarding security management, this volume not only provides fundamental concepts in security, but it also creates informed, critical, and creative security managers who communicate effectively in their environment. It helps create a practitioner who will completely examine the environment and make informed well-thought-out judgments to tailor a security program to fit a specific organization.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>In Profit over Privacy, Matthew Crain gives internet surveillance a much-needed origin story by chronicling the development of its most important historical catalyst: web advertising.</p>\n\n<p>Profit over Privacy uses the 1990s as its backdrop to show how the massive data-collection infrastructure that undergirds the internet today is the result of twenty-five years of technical and political economic engineering. Crain considers the social causes and consequences of the internet's rapid embrace of consumer monitoring, detailing how advertisers and marketers adapted to the existential threat of the internet and marshaled venture capital to develop the now-ubiquitous business model called \"surveillance advertising.\" He draws on a range of primary resources from government, industry, and the press and highlights the political roots of internet advertising to underscore the necessity of political solutions to reign in unaccountable commercial surveillance.</p>\n\n<p>Surveillance advertising is the result of political choices-not the inevitable march of technology. Unlike many other countries, the United States has no internet privacy law. A fascinating prehistory of internet advertising giants like Google and Facebook, Profit over Privacy argues that the internet did not have to turn out this way and that it can be remade into something better.<br></p></span>",

    "title": "10 Don'ts on Your Digital Devices: The Non-Techies Survival Guide to Cyber Security and Privacy",
    "description": "<span><span><p/><p>In nontechnical language and engaging style, <em>10 Donts on Your Digital Devices</em> explains to non-techie users of PCs and handheld devices exactly what to do and what not to do to protect their digital data from security and privacy threats at home, at work, and on the road. These include chronic threats such as malware and phishing attacks and emerging threats that exploit cloud-based storage and mobile apps.</p><p>Its a wonderful thing to be able to use any of your cloud-synced assortment of desktop, portable, mobile, and wearable computing devices to work from home, shop at work, pay in a store, do your banking from a coffee shop, submit your tax returns from the airport, or post your selfies from the Oscars. But with this new world of connectivity and convenience comes a host of new perils for the lazy, the greedy, the unwary, and the ignorant. The 10 Donts cant do much for the lazy and the greedy, but they can save the unwary and the ignorant a world of trouble.</p><p><em>10 Donts</em> employs personal anecdotes and major news stories to illustrate what canand all too often doeshappen when users are careless with their devices and data. Each chapter describes a common type of blunder (one of the 10 Donts), reveals how it opens a particular port of entry to predatory incursions and privacy invasions, and details all the unpleasant consequences that may come from doing a Dont. The chapter then shows you how to diagnose and fix the resulting problems, how to undo or mitigate their costs, and how to protect against repetitions with specific software defenses and behavioral changes.</p><p>Through ten vignettes told in accessible language and illustrated with helpful screenshots, <em>10 Donts</em> teaches non-technical readers ten key lessons for protecting your digital security and privacy with the same care you reflexively give to your physical security and privacy, so that you <em>dont</em> get phished, give up your password, get lost in the cloud, look for a free lunch, do secure things from insecure places, let the snoops in, be careless when going mobile, use dinosaurs, or forget the physicalin short, so that you <em>dont</em> trust anyone overanything.</p><p>Non-techie readers are not unsophisticated readers. They spend much of their waking lives on their devices and are bombarded with and alarmed by news stories of unimaginably huge data breaches, unimaginably sophisticated \"advanced persistent threat\" activities by criminal organizations and hostile nation-states, and unimaginably intrusive clandestine mass electronic surveillance and data mining sweeps by corporations, data brokers, and the various intelligence and law enforcement arms of our own governments. The authors lift the veil on these shadowy realms, show how the little guy is affected, and what individuals can do to shield themselves from big predators and snoops.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>When technology workloads process healthcare data, it is important to understand Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliance and what it means for the technology infrastructure in general and storage in particular. HIPAA is US legislation that was signed into law in 1996.<br/> <br/>HIPAA was enacted to protect health insurance coverage, but was later extended to ensure protection and privacy of electronic health records and transactions. In simple terms, it was instituted to modernize the exchange of healthcare information and how the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that is maintained by the healthcare and healthcare-related industries are safeguarded. </p><p>From a technology perspective, one of the core requirements of HIPAA is the protection of Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHIPer through physical, technical, and administrative defenses. From a non-compliance perspective, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) added protections to HIPAA and increased penalties $100 USD - $50,000 USD per violation. Today, HIPAA-compliant solutions are a norm in the healthcare industry worldwide.</p><p>This IBM® Redpaper publication describes HIPPA compliance requirements for storage and how security enhanced software-defined storage is designed to help meet those requirements.

(Doesn't everyone scroll down without reading to click \"I accept\"?) Without much intervention from most federal or state-level governments, companies are on their own to define what qualifies as reasonable use. In today's digital surveillance economy, there are no clear-cut best practices or guidelines. Gathering and using information can help customers-we see that in personalization and autofill of online forms. But companies must act in the best interest of their customers and treat the sensitive information users give them with the ethical care of doctors, lawyers, and financial advisers. The challenges of operating in a digital ecosystem aren't going away.

This book provides explicit hacks, tutorials, penetration tests, and step-by-step demonstrations for security professionals and Web application developers to defend their most vulnerable applications.<br/><br/>This book defines Web application security, why it should be addressed earlier in the lifecycle in development and quality assurance, and how it differs from other types of Internet security. Additionally, the book examines the procedures and technologies that are essential to developing, penetration testing and releasing a secure Web application. Through a review of recent Web application breaches, the book will expose the prolific methods hackers use to execute Web attacks using common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting and Buffer Overflows in the application layer. By taking an in-depth look at the techniques hackers use to exploit Web applications, readers will be better equipped to protect confidential.<ul><li>The Yankee Group estimates the market for Web application-security products and services will grow to $1.74 billion by 2007 from $140 million in 2002 </li><li>Author Michael Cross is a highly sought after speaker who regularly delivers Web Application presentations at leading conferences including: Black Hat, TechnoSecurity, CanSec West, Shmoo Con, Information Security, RSA Conferences, and more </li></ul>\n</span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Every organization today needs to manage the risk of exposing\nbusiness-critical data, improve business continuity, and minimize\nthe cost of managing IT security. Most all IT assets of an\norganization share a common network infrastructure. Therefore, the\nfirst line of defense is to establish proper network security. This\nsecurity is a prerequisite for a logical set of technical\ncountermeasures to protect from many different attack vectors that\nuse the network to infiltrate the backbone of an organization.</p><p>The IBM® Security Network Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)\nstops network-based threats before they can impact the business\noperations of an organization. Preemptive protection, which is\nprotection that works ahead of a threat, is available by means of a\ncombination of line-speed performance, security intelligence, and a\nmodular protection engine that enables security convergence. By\nconsolidating network security demands for data security and\nprotection for web applications, the IBM Security Network IPS\nserves as the security platform that can reduce the costs and\ncomplexity of deploying and managing point solutions.</p><p>This IBM Redbooks® publication provides IT architects and\nsecurity specialists a better understanding of the challenging\ntopic of blocking network threats. This book highlights security\nconvergence of IBM Virtual Patch® technology, data security,\nand Web Application Protection. In addition, this book explores the\ntechnical foundation of the IBM Security Network IPS. It explains\nhow to set up, configure, and maintain proper network perimeter\nprotection within a real-world business scenario.</p></span>",

Security policies are kept and honored whenever the data is accessed. Future data access may be revoked remotely via Data Privacy Passports, long after data leaves the system of record, and sensitive data may even be made unusable simply by destroying its encryption key.</p><p>Data Privacy Passports is designed to help reduce the time that is spent by staff to protect data and ensure privacy throughout its lifecycle via a central point of control. </p><p>This IBM Redguide presents a business view of Data Privacy Passports, including how data privacy and protection concerns are addressed.

    "description": "<span><p>This volume describes frontiers in social-behavioral modeling for contexts as diverse as national security, health, and on-line social gaming. Recent scientific and technological advances have created exciting opportunities for such improvements. However, the book also identifies crucial scientific, ethical, and cultural challenges to be met if social-behavioral modeling is to achieve its potential. Doing so will require new methods, data sources, and technology. The volume discusses these, including those needed to achieve and maintain high standards of ethics and privacy. The result should be a new generation of modeling that will advance science and, separately, aid decision-making on major social and security-related subjects despite the myriad uncertainties and complexities of social phenomena. </p><p>Intended to be relatively comprehensive in scope, the volume balances theory-driven, data-driven, and hybrid approaches. The latter may be rapidly iterative, as when artificial-intelligence methods are coupled with theory-driven insights to build models that are sound, comprehensible and usable in new situations.</p><p>With the intent of being a milestone document that sketches a research agenda for the next decade, the volume draws on the wisdom, ideas and suggestions of many noted researchers who draw in turn from anthropology, communications, complexity science, computer science, defense planning, economics, engineering, health systems, medicine, neuroscience, physics, political science, psychology, public policy and sociology. </p><p>In brief, the volume discusses:</p><ul><li>Cutting-edge challenges and opportunities in modeling for social and behavioral science</li><li>Special requirements for achieving high standards of privacy and ethics </li><li>New approaches for developing theory while exploiting both empirical and computational data</li><li>Issues of reproducibility, communication, explanation, and validation</li><li>Special requirements for models intended to inform decision making about complex social systems</li></ul></span>",

This visionary guide by Cleveland Clinic’s esteemed CIO shows you how to design, implement, and maximize your organization’s IT systems to deliver fully integrated, coordinated, high-quality care. You’ll learn how to:</p><p>• Collaborate with patients: Track and monitor patients’ progress and communicate with them any time, anywhere.<br/>\n• Coordinate multiple caregivers and care teams: Build a network of communication among healthcare professionals across disciplines in different locations who are working on a single patient case; and integrate various IT systems into a fully functioning network.<br/>\n• Optimize electronic medical records: Quickly pull up and share patient histories, test results, and other essential data to provide timely care; and expand real-time access to clinical data and research.<br/>\n• Use IT for competitive advantage: Enable live chats, virtual visits, and online second opinions; create a content-rich, user-friendly website; build a social media strategy that engages patients and caregivers alike.</p><p>Using the latest advancements in IT, you’ll be able to access and apply a wide range of online tools and field-tested strategies to any organization. Go behind the scenes at Clinic Cleveland to see how caregivers executed their IT strategy in a working environment—and how patients benefitted as a result. You’ll find simple but powerful ways to expand your IT network <em>and </em>provide personal, one-on-one care to all of your patients, anywhere in the world. By connecting your patients with caregivers—and caregivers with each other—you’ll be better equipped to diagnose conditions, recommend treatments, and monitor patients in ways that weren’t even possible 10 years ago. And you’ll see a vision of where IT is headed in the Internet of Healthcare.</p><p>This is the future of healthcare. It’s on your computer, your phone, your tablet, your network, and the world wide web. It’s the IT advantage that makes organizations like Cleveland Clinic so successful—and patients healthier and happier. It’s about time. <em>IT’s About Patient Care.</em><br/>\n</p></span></span>",

Recent work for auditing models for fairness often requires access to potentially sensitive demographic information, placing algorithmic fairness in conflict with individual privacy.</p><p>For example, gender recognition technology struggles to recognize the gender of transgender individuals. To develop more accurate models, we require information that could “out” these individuals, putting their social, psychological, and physical safety at risk.</p><p>We will discuss social science perspectives on privacy and how these paradigms can be incorporated into statistical measures of anonymity.

    "description": "<span><p>The Definitive Guide to Complying with the HIPAA/HITECH Privacy and Security Rules is a comprehensive manual to ensuring compliance with the implementation standards of the Privacy and Security Rules of HIPAA and provides recommendations based on other related regulations and industry best practices. The book is designed to assist you in reviewing the accessibility of electronic protected health information (EPHI) to make certain that it is not altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner, and that it is available as needed only by authorized individuals for authorized use. It can also help those entities that may not be covered by HIPAA regulations but want to assure their customers they are doing their due diligence to protect their personal and private information. Since HIPAA/HITECH rules generally apply to covered entities, business associates, and their subcontractors, these rules may soon become de facto standards for all companies to follow. Even if you aren't required to comply at this time, you may soon fall within the HIPAA/HITECH purview. So, it is best to move your procedures in the right direction now. The book covers administrative, physical, and technical safeguards; organizational requirements; and policies, procedures, and documentation requirements. It provides sample documents and directions on using the policies and procedures to establish proof of compliance. This is critical to help prepare entities for a HIPAA assessment or in the event of an HHS audit. Chief information officers and security officers who master the principles in this book can be confident they have taken the proper steps to protect their clients' information and strengthen their security posture. This can provide a strategic advantage to their organization, demonstrating to clients that they not only care about their health and well-being, but are also vigilant about protecting their clients' privacy.</p></span>",

In theory, advances in healthcare research promise better care and improved safety for patients. In practice, there are barriers that undermine change. The author calls attention to the underutilized healthcare librarian at a time when clinical information delivery to the doctor or nurse is equal to or more important than how wired the hospital is. This is a book for healthcare stakeholders who support evidence-based practice and for those considering entering medical librarianship. The profession is in flux as hospitals must decide whether they can afford a library and librarian or whether they can afford not to have one.</p><br/><br/><ul><li>Discusses current trends in healthcare librarianship</li><li>Describes the daily job duties of a hospital librarian</li><li>Looks at barriers to hospitals practicing evidence-based medicine</li><li>Connects improved patient care to healthcare librarian services</li></ul></span></span>",

Network security education generally lacks appropriate textbooks with detailed, hands-on exercises that include both offensive and defensive techniques. Using step-by-step processes to build and generate attacks using offensive techniques, Network Attacks and Defenses: A Hands-on Approach enables students to implement appropriate network security solutions within a laboratory environment. Topics covered in the labs include: Content Addressable Memory (CAM) table poisoning attacks on network switches Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache poisoning attacks The detection and prevention of abnormal ARP traffic Network traffic sniffing and the detection of Network Interface Cards (NICs) running in promiscuous mode Internet Protocol-Based Denial-of-Service (IP-based DoS) attacks Reconnaissance traffic Network traffic filtering and inspection Common mechanisms used for router security and device hardening Internet Protocol Security Virtual Private Network (IPsec VPN) security solution protocols, standards, types, and deployments Remote Access IPsec VPN security solution architecture and its design, components, architecture, and implementations These practical exercises go beyond theory to allow students to better anatomize and elaborate offensive and defensive techniques. Educators can use the model scenarios described in this book to design and implement innovative hands-on security exercises. Students who master the techniques in this book will be well armed to counter a broad range of network security threats.</p></span>",

It offers a valuable dual perspective on security: how your network looks to hackers who want to get inside, and how you need to approach it on the inside to keep them at bay.</p><p>You get all the hands-on technical advice you need to succeed, but also higher-level administrative guidance for developing an effective security policy. There may be no such thing as absolute security, but, as the author clearly demonstrates, there is a huge difference between the protection offered by routine reliance on third-party products and what you can achieve by actively making informed decisions. You’ll learn to do just that with this book’s assessments of the risks, rewards, and trade-offs related implementing security measures.</p><ul><li>Helps you see through a hacker's eyes so you can make your network more secure.</li><li>Provides technical advice that can be applied in any environment, on any platform, including help with intrusion detection systems, firewalls, encryption, anti-virus software, and digital certificates.</li><li>Emphasizes a wide range of administrative considerations, including security policies, user management, and control of services and devices.</li><li>Covers techniques for enhancing the physical security of your systems and network.</li><li>Explains how hackers use information-gathering to find and exploit security flaws.</li><li>Examines the most effective ways to prevent hackers from gaining root access to a server.</li><li>Addresses Denial of Service attacks, \"malware,\" and spoofing.</li><li>Includes appendices covering the TCP/IP protocol stack, well-known ports, and reliable sources for security warnings and updates.</li></ul></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>\nTo the uninitiated, the title may seem like an oxymoron: after all,\naren't hacks what network security is supposed to prevent? But if\nyou're network administrator, this book's title not only makes\nsense; it makes a lot of sense. You know that a busy administrator\nneeds a hatful of devilishly effective security hacks to keep your\n12-hour days from becoming all-nighters. <em>Network Security\nHacks</em> is not a long-winded treatise on security theory.\nInstead, this information packed little book provides 100 quick,\npractical, and clever things to do to help make your Linux, UNIX,\nor Windows networks more secure today. This compendium of security\nhacks doesn't just cover securing TCP/IP-based services, but also\nprovides intelligent host-based security techniques. Loaded with\nconcise but powerful examples of applied encryption, intrusion\ndetection, logging, trending, and incident response, <em>Network\nSecurity Hacks</em> will demonstrate effective methods for defending\nyour servers and networks from a variety of devious and subtle\nattacks. <em>Network Security Hacks</em> show how to detect the\npresence (and track every keystroke) of network intruders, methods\nfor protecting your network and data using strong encryption, and\neven techniques for laying traps for would-be system crackers.\nImportant security tools are presented, as well as clever methods\nfor using them to reveal real, timely, useful information about\nwhat is happening on your network. O'Reilly's Hacks Series reclaims\nthe term \"hacking\" for the good guys--innovators who use their\ningenuity to solve interesting problems, explore and experiment,\nunearth shortcuts, and create useful tools. <em>Network Security\nHacks</em> lives up to reputation the Hacks series has earned by\nproviding the \"roll-up-your sleeves and get-it-done\" hacks that\nmost network security tomes don't offer. Every hack can be read in\njust a few minutes but will save hours of searching for the right\nanswer. Using just one of these amazing hacks will make this slim\nbook's price seem like a remarkable deal. The other 99 make\n<em>Network Security Hacks</em> absolutely invaluable.\n</p></span></span>",

Every time you visit a website, use a credit card, drive on the freeway, or go past a CCTV camera, you are logged and tracked. Every day billions of people choose to share their details on social media, which are then sold to advertisers.</p><p>The Edward Snowden revelations that governments - including those of the US and UK – have been snooping on their citizens, have rocked the world. But nobody seems to realize that this has already been happening for years, with firms such as Google capturing everything you type into a browser and selling it to the highest bidder. Apps take information about where you go, and your contact book details, harvest them and sell them on – and people just click the EULA without caring. No one is revealing the dirty secret that is the tech firms harvesting customers’ personal data and selling it for vast profits – and people are totally unaware of the dangers.</p><p><b><i>You: For Sale</i></b> is for anyone who is concerned about what corporate and government invasion of privacy means now and down the road. The book sets the scene by spelling out exactly what most users of the Internet and smart phones are exposing themselves to via commonly used sites and apps such as facebook and Google, and then tells you what you can do to protect yourself. The book also covers legal and government issues as well as future trends.</p><p>With interviews of leading security experts, black market data traders, law enforcement and privacy groups, <b><i>You: For Sale</i></b> will help you view your personal data in a new light, and understand both its value, and its danger.</p><ul><li>Provides a clear picture of how companies and governments harvest and use personal data every time someone logs on</li><li>Describes exactly what these firms do with the data once they have it – and what you can do to stop it</li><li>Learn about the dangers of unwittingly releasing private data to tech firms, including interviews with top security experts, black market data traders, law enforcement and privacy groups</li><li>Understand the legal information and future trends that make this one of the most important issues today</li></ul></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><span><p><em>Discover how technology is affecting your business, and why typical security mechanisms are failing to address the issue of risk and trust.</em></p><p>Security for a Web 2.0+ World looks at the perplexing issues of cyber security, and will be of interest to those who need to know how to make effective security policy decisions to engineers who design ICT systems – a guide to information security and standards in the Web 2.0+ era. It provides an understanding of IT security in the converged world of communications technology based on the Internet Protocol.</p><p>Many companies are currently applying security models following legacy policies or ad-hoc solutions. A series of new security standards (ISO/ITU) allow security professionals to talk a common language. By applying a common standard, security vendors are able to create products and services that meet the challenging security demands of technology further diffused from the central control of the local area network. Companies are able to prove and show the level of maturity of their security solutions based on their proven compliance of the recommendations defined by the standard.</p><p>Carlos Solari and his team present much needed information and a broader view on why and how to use and deploy standards. They set the stage for a standards-based approach to design in security, driven by various factors that include securing complex information-communications systems, the need to drive security in product development, the need to better apply security funds to get a better return on investment.</p><p>Security applied after complex systems are deployed is at best a patchwork fix. Concerned with what can be done <em>now</em> using the technologies and methods at our disposal, the authors set in place the idea that security can be <em>designed in</em> to the complex networks that exist now and for those in the near future. Web 2.0 is the next great promise of ICT – we still have the chance to <em>design in</em> a more secure path.</p><p>Time is of the essence – <em>prevent-detect-respond!</em></p></span></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span>\nThis book will take readers from the discovery of vulnerabilities and the creation of the corresponding exploits, through a complete security assessment, all the way through deploying patches against these vulnerabilities to protect their networks. <br/><br/>This is unique in that it details both the management and technical skill and tools required to develop an effective vulnerability management system. Business case studies and real world vulnerabilities are used through the book. It starts by introducing the reader to the concepts of a vulnerability management system. Readers will be provided detailed timelines of exploit development, vendors’ time to patch, and corporate path installations. Next, the differences between security assessment s and penetration tests will be clearly explained along with best practices for conducting both. Next, several case studies from different industries will illustrate the effectiveness of varying vulnerability assessment methodologies. The next several chapters will define the steps of a vulnerability assessment including: defining objectives, identifying and classifying assets, defining rules of engagement, scanning hosts, and identifying operating systems and applications. The next several chapters provide detailed instructions and examples for differentiating vulnerabilities from configuration problems, validating vulnerabilities through penetration testing. The last section of the book provides best practices for vulnerability management and remediation.<br/><br/>* Unique coverage detailing both the management and technical skill and tools required to develop an effective vulnerability management system<br/><br/>* Vulnerability management is rated the #2 most pressing concern for security professionals in a poll conducted by Information Security Magazine<br/><br/>* Covers in the detail the vulnerability management lifecycle from discovery through patch.\n</span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>If you're an advanced security professional, then you know that the battle to protect online privacy continues to rage on.  Security chat rooms, especially, are resounding with calls for vendors to take more responsibility to release products that are more secure.  In fact, with all the information and code that is passed on a daily basis, it's a fight that may never end.  Fortunately, there are a number of open source security tools that give you a leg up in the battle.Often a security tool does exactly what you want, right out of the box.  More frequently,  you need to customize the tool to fit the needs of your network structure.  <i>Network Security Tools</i> shows experienced administrators how to modify, customize, and extend popular open source security tools such as Nikto, Ettercap, and Nessus.This concise, high-end guide discusses the common customizations and extensions for these tools, then shows you how to write even more specialized attack and penetration reviews that are suited to your unique network environment.  It also explains how tools like port scanners, packet injectors, network sniffers, and web assessment tools function.Some of the topics covered include:</p><ul><li>Writing your own network sniffers and packet injection tools</li><li>Writing plugins for Nessus, Ettercap, and Nikto</li><li>Developing exploits for Metasploit</li><li>Code analysis for web applications</li><li>Writing kernel modules for security applications, and understanding rootkits</li></ul>While many books on security are either tediously academic or overly sensational, <i>Network Security Tools</i> takes an even-handed and accessible approach that will let you quickly review the problem and implement new, practical solutions--without reinventing the wheel.  In an age when security is critical, <i>Network Security Tools</i> is the resource you want at your side when locking down your network.</div></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Concerns about healthcare security have proliferated in recent years, with one recent study reporting that 17% of registered nurses surveyed had been physically attacked at work over a 1-year period. From privacy concerns to the mandates of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to the rapid growth in the number of aging and ailing baby boomers, healthcare has undergone dramatic change, and security in hospitals and other settings must keep pace. Most educators, healthcare executives, and healthcare agencies and associations agree that <i><b>Hospital and Healthcare Security</b></i>, a Butterworth-Heinemann classic, has set the standard of care for healthcare security systems and programs.</p><p><b><i>Hospital and Healthcare Security, 5th Edition</i></b>, builds on the solid foundation laid down by Russell Colling in the first four editions, covering the shifts that have occurred in healthcare security since the last edition appeared in 2001. The new co-author, Tony York, is a well-regarded security professional and a past president of the International Association for Hospital Security and Safety (IAHSS). This new edition has been reorganized and rewritten to cover new healthcare security topics and issues, particularly in licensing, regulatory requirements, litigation, and accreditation standards in the US. The authors have added a full range of corresponding examples, not only from the privately funded US system but also from national healthcare systems in UK and Canada. </p><p>This new edition expands the scope of Colling's foundational work and focuses its coverage of legal and operational issues to bring this vital information to a new and broader audience.</p><br/><br/>FEATURES AND BENEFITS:<br/>* Practical support for healthcare security professionals, including operationally proven policies, and procedures<br/>* Specific assistance in preparing plans and materials tailored to healthcare security programs<br/>* Summary tables and sample forms bring together key data, facilitating ROI discussions with administrators and other departments<br/>* General principles clearly laid out so readers can apply the industry standards most appropriate to their own environment<br/>NEW TO THIS EDITION:<br/>* Quick-start section for hospital administrators who need an overview of security issues and best practices</span>",

    "description": "<span><p>With Obfuscation, Finn Brunton and Helen Nissenbaum mean to start a revolution. They are calling us not to the barricades but to our computers, offering us ways to fight today's pervasive digital surveillance -- the collection of our data by governments, corporations, advertisers, and hackers. To the toolkit of privacy protecting techniques and projects, they propose adding obfuscation: the deliberate use of ambiguous, confusing, or misleading information to interfere with surveillance and data collection projects. Brunton and Nissenbaum provide tools and a rationale for evasion, noncompliance, refusal, even sabotage -- especially for average users, those of us not in a position to opt out or exert control over data about ourselves. Obfuscation will teach users to push back, software developers to keep their user data safe, and policy makers to gather data without misusing it.</p>\n\n<p>Brunton and Nissenbaum present a guide to the forms and formats that obfuscation has taken and explain how to craft its implementation to suit the goal and the adversary. They describe a series of historical and contemporary examples, including radar chaff deployed by World War II pilots, Twitter bots that hobbled the social media strategy of popular protest movements, and software that can camouflage users' search queries and stymie online advertising. They go on to consider obfuscation in more general terms, discussing why obfuscation is necessary, whether it is justified, how it works, and how it can be integrated with other privacy practices and technologies.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>There are hundreds--if not thousands--of techniques used to compromise both Windows and Unix-based systems. Malicious code and new exploit scripts are released on a daily basis, and each evolution becomes more and more sophisticated. Keeping up with the myriad of systems used by hackers in the wild is a formidable task, and scrambling to patch each potential vulnerability or address each new attack one-by-one is a bit like emptying the Atlantic with paper cup.If you're a network administrator, the pressure is on you to defend your systems from attack. But short of devoting your life to becoming a security expert, what can you do to ensure the safety of your mission critical systems?  Where do you start?Using the steps laid out by professional security analysts and consultants to identify and assess risks, <i>Network Security Assessment</i> offers an efficient testing model that an administrator can adopt, refine, and reuse to create proactive defensive strategies to protect their systems from the threats that are out there, as well as those still being developed.This thorough and insightful guide covers offensive technologies by grouping and analyzing them at a higher level--from both an offensive and defensive standpoint--helping administrators design and deploy networks that are immune to offensive exploits, tools, and scripts. Network administrators who need to develop and implement a security assessment program will find everything they're looking for--a proven, expert-tested methodology on which to base their own comprehensive program--in this time-saving new book.</p></span></span>",

    "title": "Seven Deadliest Network Attacks",
    "description": "<span><p><i>Seven Deadliest Network Attacks</i> identifies seven classes of network attacks and discusses how the attack works, including tools to accomplish the attack, the risks of the attack, and how to defend against the attack. This book pinpoints the most dangerous hacks and exploits specific to networks, laying out the anatomy of these attacks including how to make your system more secure. You will discover the best ways to defend against these vicious hacks with step-by-step instruction and learn techniques to make your computer and network impenetrable.</p><p>The book consists of seven chapters that deal with the following attacks: denial of service; war dialing; penetration testing; protocol tunneling; spanning tree attacks; man-in-the-middle; and password replay. These attacks are not mutually exclusive and were chosen because they help illustrate different aspects of network security. The principles on which they rely are unlikely to vanish any time soon, and they allow for the possibility of gaining something of interest to the attacker, from money to high-value data. This book is intended to provide practical, usable information. However, the world of network security is evolving very rapidly, and the attack that works today may (hopefully) not work tomorrow. It is more important, then, to understand the principles on which the attacks and exploits are based in order to properly plan either a network attack or a network defense.</p><p><i>Seven Deadliest Network Attacks</i> will appeal to information security professionals of all levels, network admins, and recreational hackers.</p><ul><li>Knowledge is power, find out about the most dominant attacks currently waging war on computers and networks globally</li><li>Discover the best ways to defend against these vicious attacks; step-by-step instruction shows you how</li><li>Institute countermeasures, don’t be caught defenseless again, and learn techniques to make your computer and network impenetrable </li></ul></span>",

    "title": "Data Privacy for the Smart Grid",
    "description": "<span><p>Many Smart Grid books include \"privacy\" in their title, but only touch on privacy, with most of the discussion focusing on cybersecurity. Filling this knowledge gap, <b>Data Privacy for the Smart Grid</b> provides a clear description of the Smart Grid ecosystem, presents practical guidance about its privacy risks, and details the actions required to protect data generated by Smart Grid technologies. It addresses privacy in electric, natural gas, and water grids and supplies two different perspectives of the topic—one from a Smart Grid expert and another from a privacy and information security expert.<br/><br/>The authors have extensive experience with utilities and leading the U.S. government’s National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST) Cyber Security Working Group (CSWG)/Smart Grid Interoperability Group (SGIP) Privacy Subgroup. This comprehensive book is understandable for all those involved in the Smart Grid. The authors detail the facts about Smart Grid privacy so readers can separate truth from myth about Smart Grid privacy. <br/><br/>While considering privacy in the Smart Grid, the book also examines the data created by Smart Grid technologies and machine-to-machine (M2M) applications and associated legal issues. <br/><br/>The text details guidelines based on the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Privacy Guidelines and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission Fair Information Practices. It includes privacy training recommendations and references to additional Smart Grid privacy resources.<br/><br/>After reading the book, readers will be prepared to develop informed opinions, establish fact-based decisions, make meaningful contributions to Smart Grid legislation and policies, and to build technologies to preserve and protect privacy. Policy makers; Smart Grid and M2M product and service developers; utility customer and privacy resources; and other service providers and resources are primary beneficiaries of the information provided in <strong>Data Privacy for the Smart Grid</strong>. However, everyone interested in Smart Grid privacy implications will derive great value from this book.</p></span>",
