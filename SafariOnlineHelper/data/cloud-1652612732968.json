Survival is not mandatory.”</em> - W. Edwards Deming<br/>\n <br/>\n Work takes time to flow through an organization and ultimately be deployed to production where it captures value. It’s critical to reduce time-to-production. Software is a competitive advantage for many organizations and industries.<br/>\n <br/>\n Organizations break their larger software ambitions into smaller, independently deployable, feature-centric batches of work--microservices. In order to reduce the round-trip between stations of work, organizations collapse or consolidate as much of them as possible and automate the rest; developers and operations beget “devops”; and cloud-based services and platforms (like Cloud Foundry) automate operations work and break down the need for ITIL tickets and change management boards.<br/>\n <br/>\n But velocity, for velocity’s sake, is dangerous. Microservices invite architectural complexity that few are prepared to address. <br/><br/>\n In <strong>Cloud Native Java LiveLessons</strong>, we look at how high-performance organizations are addressing the requirements of distribution with Spring Cloud.<br/>\n <br/>\n <strong>Related Title</strong><br/>\n <br/>\n <em><a href=\"https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/building-microservices-with/9780134678658/\" target=\"\" title=\"\">Microservices with Spring Boot LiveLessons, 2nd Edition</a><br/><strong>About the Instructor</strong><br/><br/><strong>Josh Long</strong> is the Spring Developer Advocate at Pivotal.

To successfully build upon, integrate with, or even create a cloud environment requires an understanding of its common inner mechanics, architectural layers, and models, as well as an understanding of the business and economic factors that result from the adoption and real-world use of cloud-based services.</p><p>In <em>Cloud Computing: Concepts, Technology &amp; Architecture</em>, Thomas Erl, one of the world’s top-selling IT authors, teams up with cloud computing experts and researchers to break down proven and mature cloud computing technologies and practices into a series of well-defined concepts, models, technology mechanisms, and technology architectures, all from an industry-centric and vendor-neutral point of view. In doing so, the book establishes concrete, academic coverage with a focus on structure, clarity, and well-defined building blocks for mainstream cloud computing platforms and solutions.</p><p>Subsequent to technology-centric coverage, the book proceeds to establish business-centric models and metrics that allow for the financial assessment of cloud-based IT resources and their comparison to those hosted on traditional IT enterprise premises. Also provided are templates and formulas for calculating SLA-related quality-of-service values and numerous explorations of the SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS delivery models.</p><p>With more than 260 figures, 29 architectural models, and 20 mechanisms, this indispensable guide provides a comprehensive education of cloud computing essentials that will never leave your side.</p></div></span>",

Cloud native architectures give you the benefit of more flexibility over legacy systems. To harness this, businesses need to refresh their development models and architectures when they find they don't port to the cloud. Cloud Native Architectures demonstrates three essential components of deploying modern cloud native architectures: organizational transformation, deployment modernization, and cloud native architecture patterns.\n</p><p>This book starts with a quick introduction to cloud native architectures that are used as a base to define and explain what cloud native architecture is and is not. You will learn what a cloud adoption framework looks like and develop cloud native architectures using microservices and serverless computing as design principles. You'll then explore the major pillars of cloud native design including scalability, cost optimization, security, and ways to achieve operational excellence. In the concluding chapters, you will also learn about various public cloud architectures ranging from AWS and Azure to the Google Cloud Platform.\n</p><p>By the end of this book, you will have learned the techniques to adopt cloud native architectures that meet your business requirements. You will also understand the future trends and expectations of cloud providers.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Learn the difference between cloud native and traditional architecture\n</li><li>Explore the aspects of migration, when and why to use it\n</li><li>Identify the elements to consider when selecting a technology for your architecture\n</li><li>Automate security controls and configuration management\n</li><li>Use infrastructure as code and CICD pipelines to run environments in a sustainable manner\n</li><li>Understand the management and monitoring capabilities for AWS cloud native application architectures</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>Cloud Native Architectures is for software architects who are keen on designing resilient, scalable, and highly available applications that are native to the cloud.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book You can download the example code files for all Packt books you have purchased from your account at http://www.PacktPub.com.

    "description": "<span><p>If your organization is planning a move to the cloud this year, choosing a provider from among hundreds available can be the most difficult part. How do you narrow down the field? In this article, Jesse Anderson, managing director of the Big Data Institute, provides guidelines to help you find a cloud provider that meets your company’s specific needs.<br/><br/>Understanding your use case is key. Providers employ different technologies, and if your organization is tackling big data problems at scale, those differences can be critical. There are also logistical concerns: How difficult will it be to train your staff on the provider’s technologies? Who in your company will be responsible for the many moving parts? How do you deal with vendor lock-in?<br/><br/>With the guidelines in this article, you’ll learn how to distinguish among the capabilities of various cloud providers and then fine-tune your decision process by homing in on questions related to your particular use case.</p></span>",

Companies moving all or part of their IT workloads to the public cloud for backup, email hosting, productivity apps or all of the above will generate $44 billion in costs during 2018 alone. So, the question is not if but how enterprises plan to make the move. This ebook provides a practical seven-step migration plan to prepare your company for the journey.</p><p>Author Steve Francis provides a prescriptive look at the best practices needed to ensure a successful transition. You’ll also learn from several IT and business leaders about their recent cloud migration experiences, including pitfalls to avoid. This seven-step plan focuses on three major benefits of the cloud: operational agility, strategic focus, and cost savings:</p><ul><li>Identify desired outcomes before you get into migration specifics</li><li>Classify candidates for the cloud, including applications or workloads best suited for the move</li><li>Define deployment model criteria—IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, or a private cloud</li><li>Devise an iterative, agile process for transformation among your teams</li><li>Get buy-in to the plan from people at the top and in the trenches</li><li>Start simply with a project that’s relatively risk-free—one you’re likely to learn from the most</li><li>Rinse and repeat by applying lessons learned to the next workload or application</li></ul></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><i>What is “the cloud”? Is it here or there? Should it be allowed? Should I even care?</i></p><p>Have you ever imagined the internet as a giant Rube Goldberg machine? Or the fast-evolving cloud computing space as a literal jungle filled with prehistoric beasts? Does a data breach look like a neo-noir nightmare full of turned-up coat collars and rain-soaked alleys? Wouldn’t all these vital concepts be easier to understand if they <i>looked </i>as interesting as they <i>are?</i> And wouldn’t they be more memorable if we could explain them in rhyme? Whether you’re a kid or an adult, the answer is: YES!</p><p>The medicine in this spoonful of sugar is a sneaky-informative tour through the past, present and future of cloud computing, from mainframes to serverless and from the Internet of Things to artificial intelligence. Forrest is a professional explainer whose highly-rated conference talks and viral cartoon graphics have been teaching engineers to cloud for years. He knows that a picture is worth a thousand words. But he has plenty of words, too.</p><p><i>Your hotel key, your boarding pass,<br/></i><i>The card you swipe to pay for gas,<br/></i><i>The smart TV atop the bar,<br/></i><i>The entertainment in your car,<br/></i><i>Your doorbell, toothbrush, thermostat,<br/></i><i>The vacuum that attacked your cat,<br/></i><i>They all connect the cloud and you.<br/></i><i>Maybe they shouldn't, but they do.</i> </p><p>As a graduation gift (call it “Oh the Places You’ll Go” for engineering students), a cubicle conversation starter, or just a delightfully nerdy bedtime story for your kids, “The Read-Aloud Cloud” will be the definitive introduction to the technologies that everyone uses and nobody understands. You can even read it silently if you want. But good luck with that.</p></span>",

For many enterprises, the move to cloud computing has raised concerns for security, but when applications are architected with focus on security, cloud platforms can be made just as secure as on-premises platforms. Cloud instances can be kept secure by employing security automation that helps make your data meet your organization's security policy.</p><p>This book starts with the basics of why cloud security is important and how automation can be the most effective way of controlling cloud security. You will then delve deeper into the AWS cloud environment and its security services by dealing with security functions such as Identity and Access Management and will also learn how these services can be automated. Moving forward, you will come across aspects such as cloud storage and data security, automating cloud deployments, and so on. Then, you'll work with OpenStack security modules and learn how private cloud security functions can be automated for better time- and cost-effectiveness. Toward the end of the book, you will gain an understanding of the security compliance requirements for your Cloud.</p><p>By the end of this book, you will have hands-on experience of automating your cloud security and governance.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This book follows a step-by-step, practical approach to help automate and secure your cloud account structure in an Amazon Web Services (AWS) and OpenStack environment.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>As microservices, data services, and serverless APIs proliferate in a cloud native world, analysts still need to report on the business as a whole. Data engineers need to collect and standardize data in an increasingly complex and diverse system. Luckily, the problem is also the solution. The way to manage data in a cloud native environment is to build cloud native data pipelines.</p><p>Gwen Shapira (Confluent) discusses how data engineering requirements have changed in a cloud native world and how the solutions have changed with them. She then shares architectural patterns that are commonly used to build cloud native data infrastructure and explains how they help you build flexible, scalable, and reliable pipelines to give your business visibility on all your data.</p><p>This session was recorded at the 2019 O'Reilly Strata Data Conference in San Francisco.</p></div></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>By using distributed architectures, the cloud native ecosystem enables organizations to build scalable, resilient, and novel software architectures. But the ever-changing nature of distributed systems means that previous approaches to monitoring can no longer keep up. Cloud native systems require a new approach to monitoring, one that is open source compatible, scalable, reliable, and able to control for massive data growth.</p><p>But cloud native monitoring can't exist in a vacuum: it needs to be part of a broader observability strategy. In this report, authors Kenichi Shibata, Martin Mao, and Rob Skillington introduce the three phases of observability, a pragmatic, goal-driven approach to cloud native monitoring that emphasizes remediating problems. With this method, you'll collect, aggregate, and analyze metrics that focus on the outcomes you want to achieve: to rectify or prevent issues in your system so you can focus on improving business outcomes.</p><p>The three phases of observability include:</p><ul><li><em>Knowing</em>\n                    within the team quickly if something is wrong\n                </li><li><em>Triaging</em>\n                    to identify the urgency of issues and decide which ones to prioritize\n                </li><li><em>Performing a root cause analysis</em>\n                    to understand and fix the underlying problem\n                </li></ul></div></span>",

Experiences shared by the author are drawn from real-life migration projects and contain practical advice, as well as step-by-step architecture, design, and technical implementation instructions using sample application code on GitLab. Following the guidance in this book will provide much needed support to your teams, and help you successfully complete the application cloud migration journey.  </p><p><b><i>Systematic Cloud Migration</i></b> consists of four major parts. Part one starts with a fundamental introduction of cloud computing to establish the context for migration, including paradigm changes in five important areas: software application, DevSecOps, operations, infrastructure, and security. And these are the areas that the book follows throughout. Next, it introduces a real-life migration process that your team can follow. </p><p>Part two presents the migration process for the application code, including architecture diagrams and presented by demo application code and supporting infrastructure in AWS cloud. Part three dives into DevSecOps and automation. In addition to concepts, a real-life migration diagram and sample pipeline code implemented with GitLab are include. Part four deals with efficient cloud operations.</p><p>Each chapter has a practical structure: objectives, roles, inputs, process/activities, outputs/deliverables, best practices, and summary. There is a wealth of cloud production-grade template style artifacts that can be used as is. </p><p><br/></p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><p></p><ul><li>Design applications in the cloud, including determining the design criteria (e.g., solution cost is a design criterion, same as security, and is not an afterthought)</li><li>Understand the major migration areas: <i>software development </i>(application code, data, integration, and configuration), <i>software delivery</i> (pipeline and automation), and <i>software operations </i>(observability)</li><li>Migrate each application element: client and business components code, data, integration and services, logging, monitoring, alerting, as well as configurations</li><li>Understand cloud-critical static application security testing (SAST), dynamic application security testing (DAST), containers compliance and security scanning, and open source dependency testing</li><li>Know the directions and implementation details on cost-efficient, automated, cloud-native software operations</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>Primarily designed with software developers, team leads, development managers, DevOps engineers, and software architects in mind.

    "description": "<span><p>The IBM® mainframe remains a widely used enterprise computing workhorse, hosting essential IT for the majority of the world's top banks, airlines, insurers and more. As the mainframe continues to evolve, the newest IBM Z® servers offer solutions for AI and analytics, blockchain, cloud, DevOps, security and resiliency, with the aim of making the client experience similar to that of using cloud services.</p><p>Many organizations today face challenges with their core IT infrastructure:<br/></p><ul><br/><li>Complexity and stability<br/>An environment might have years of history and be seen as too complex to maintain or update. Problems with system stability can impact operations and be considered a high risk for the business.<br/></li><li>Workforce challenges<br/>Many data center teams are anticipating a skills shortage within the next 5 years due to a retiring and declining workforce specialized in the mainframe, not to mention the difficulty of attracting new talent. <br/></li><li>Total cost of ownership<br/>Some infrastructure solutions are seen as too expensive, and it's not always easy to balance up-front costs with the life expectancy and benefits of a given platform. <br/></li><li>Lack of speed and agility<br/>Older applications can be seen as too slow and monolithic as organizations face an increasing need for faster turnaround and release cycles. <br/></li></ul><br/>Some software vendors suggest addressing these challenges with the \"big bang\" approach of moving your entire environment to a public cloud. But public cloud isn't the best option for every workload, and a hybrid multicloud approach can offer the best of both worlds. IBM Z is constantly being developed to address the real challenges businesses face today, and every day we're helping clients modernize their IT environments. <br/>There are 4 strategic elements to consider when modernizing your mainframe environment:<br/><ul><br/><li>Infrastructure <br/></li><li>Applications <br/></li><li>Data access <br/></li><li>DevOps chain <br/></li></ul><br/>This paper focuses on these four modernization dimensions.\n\n  </span>",

Getting new features into the hands of demanding customers requires a faster and more efficient approach than traditional development methods. The most successful organizations today use cloud native to develop innovative software products and services with speed and scalability not possible with the static waterfall development method.</p><p>In this ebook, Bill Laberis explores cloud native by defining various interrelated elements of this approach. By learning terms such as DevOps, microservices, and continuous delivery, you’ll understand why cloud native is much more about how applications are built and deployed than where. This ebook includes case studies of how the Financial Times, Volkswagen, ASOS, and DISH adopted cloud native.</p><p>You’ll examine cloud native practices and components such as:</p><ul><li><b>DevOps:</b> Practices for removing barriers between development and operations</li><li><b>Continuous delivery, continuous upgrades, and automated scalability:</b> Practices vital to DevOps success</li><li><b>Containers, including Docker:</b> A method for bundling software and its dependencies into one package</li><li><b>Kubernetes:</b> A tool for deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications</li><li><b>Orchestration:</b> Automated configuration, coordination, and management of cloud systems, resources, and software</li><li><b>Microservices:</b> Architecture for building applications as a collection of services or protocols</li></ul></div></span>",

But that report was done in January 2020 at the start of the pandemic. And let's face it, a lot has changed since then.<br/><br/>So we ran another global survey at the end of July 2021 to see what kind of effect the lockdown has had on cloud adoption. Did organizations pump the brakes or hit the accelerator? Are different industries leaning toward one provider or another, and what are their biggest concerns? Are more organizations going with multicloud strategies? We dug into the data to get answers to the biggest questions and laid them all out in this in-depth report.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>Two significant shifts characterize computing in the past two decades: the widespread use of free and open source software (FOSS) and migration to the cloud. How have these trends influenced one another? O'Reilly, in collaboration with IBM, conducted a survey of software development professionals during the fall of 2020 to discover the complex relationship between these two trends.</p><p>More than 3,400 respondents from a variety of software disciplines, including developers and  managers, indicated that FOSS is maintaining and perhaps even increasing its influence in the cloud age. The survey demonstrates that these professionals have a strong loyalty to open source software, which is motivated by real career benefits and greater professional opportunities. For instance, 95% of respondents agreed that experience with Linux was valuable to their career. And 70% of respondents prefer a cloud provider that's based on open source.</p><p>This report delves into more key survey findings, including:</p><ul><li>The number of respondents who use open source software in some aspect of their operations</li><li>How open source software stacks up against proprietary software</li><li>The career and professional benefits that open source technologies provide</li><li>How many respondents have chosen cloud providers based on their use of open source software</li><li>The software technologies that respondents consider most important</li><li>And more</li></ul></div></span></span>",

Cloud assembles large networks of virtual services, including hardware (CPU, storage, and network) and software resources (databases, message queuing systems, monitoring systems, and load-balancers). </p><p>As Cloud continues to revolutionize applications in academia, industry, government, and many other fields, the transition to this efficient and flexible platform presents serious challenges at both theoretical and practical levels—ones that will often require new approaches and practices in all areas. Comprehensive and timely, <strong>Cloud Computing: Methodology, Systems, and Applications</strong> summarizes progress in state-of-the-art research and offers step-by-step instruction on how to implement it.</p><p><strong>Summarizes Cloud Developments, Identifies Research Challenges, and Outlines Future Directions</strong></p><p>Ideal for a broad audience that includes researchers, engineers, IT professionals, and graduate students, this book is designed in three sections:</p><ul><p>\n</p><li>Fundamentals of Cloud Computing: Concept, Methodology, and Overview</li><li>Cloud Computing Functionalities and Provisioning</li><li>Case Studies, Applications, and Future Directions</li><p/></ul><p>It addresses the obvious technical aspects of using Cloud but goes beyond, exploring the cultural/social and regulatory/legal challenges that are quickly coming to the forefront of discussion. Properly applied as part of an overall IT strategy, Cloud can help small and medium business enterprises (SMEs) and governments in optimizing expenditure on application-hosting infrastructure. This material outlines a strategy for using Cloud to exploit opportunities in areas including, but not limited to, government, research, business, high-performance computing, web hosting, social networking, and multimedia.</p><p>With contributions from a host of internationally recognized researchers, this reference delves into everything from necessary changes in users’ initial mindset to actual physical requirements for the successful integration of Cloud into existing in-house infrastructure. Using case studies throughout to reinforce concepts, this book also addresses recent advances and future directions in methodologies, taxonomies, IaaS/SaaS, data management and processing, programming models, and applications.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>In today's dynamically changing IT landscape, it is highly likely that a company's cloud strategy spans multiple cloud providers. Such a span is known as the hydrid multi-cloud landscape. </p><p>The challenges that quickly surface in an IT department's list of responsibilities now encompass managing environments that are running on multiple cloud providers. The traditional IT administrators find themselves using individual dashboards for each of the cloud providers to monitor and manage those environments. In turn, each of the cloud provider's dashboards have their own unique features that require a learning curve to become productive. </p><p>The traditional IT administrator must now become a specialized hybrid cloud engineer with different hats for each of the cloud providers. This dynamic led to the quick realization of the need for a tool that provides a common dashboard for managing a company's hybrid cloud landscape. IBM® is one such company that quickly recognized this need and used their experience in years of systems management tools created the IBM Cloud® Pak for Multicloud Management. </p><p>This paper describes the steps that are required to connect a Kubernetes management dashboard that is provided with the IBM Cloud Pak® for Multicloud Management running on an on-premises private cloud to Kubernetes clusters that are running on public clouds. An IBM Cloud service that is called IBM Secure Gateway is at the core of this connection. The procedure to set up the Kubernetes clusters to use the IBM Secure Gateway service also is described this paper.</p></span>",

It gives business executives the knowledge necessary to make informed, educated decisions regarding cloud initiatives.<br/><br/>The authors first discuss the evolution of computing from a historical perspective, focusing primarily on advances that led to the development of cloud computing. They then survey some of the critical components that are necessary to make the cloud computing paradigm feasible. They also present various standards based on the use and implementation issues surrounding cloud computing and describe the infrastructure management that is maintained by cloud computing service providers. After addressing significant legal and philosophical issues, the book concludes with a hard look at successful cloud computing vendors.<br/><br/>Helping to overcome the lack of understanding currently preventing even faster adoption of cloud computing, this book arms readers with guidance essential to make smart, strategic decisions on cloud initiatives. </p></span>",

The distillation of critical research findings generated by the Assured Cloud Computing Center of Excellence (ACC-UCoE) of the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, it provides unique insights into the current and future shape of robust, dependable, and secure cloud-based computing and data cyberinfrastructures.</p><p>A survivable and distributed cloud-computing-based infrastructure can enable the configuration of any dynamic systems-of-systems that contain both trusted and partially trusted resources and services sourced from multiple organizations. To assure mission-critical computations and workflows that rely on such systems-of-systems it is necessary to ensure that a given configuration does not violate any security or reliability requirements. Furthermore, it is necessary to model the trustworthiness of a workflow or computation fulfillment to a high level of assurance. In presenting the substance of the work done by the ACC-UCoE, this book provides a vision for assured cloud computing illustrating how individual research contributions relate to each other and to the big picture of assured cloud computing. In addition, the book:</p><ul><li>Explores dominant themes in cloud-based systems, including design correctness, support for big data and analytics, monitoring and detection, network considerations, and performance</li><li>Synthesizes heavily cited earlier work on topics such as DARE, trust mechanisms, and elastic graphs, as well as newer research findings on topics, including R-Storm, and RAMP transactions</li><li>Addresses assured cloud computing concerns such as game theory, stream processing, storage, algorithms, workflow, scheduling, access control, formal analysis of safety, and streaming</li></ul> Bringing together the freshest thinking and applications in one of today’s most important topics, <i>Assured Cloud Computing</i> is a must-read for researchers and professionals in the fields of computer science and engineering, especially those working within industrial, military, and governmental contexts. It is also a valuable reference for advanced students of computer science. \n   \n  </span>",

But while an understanding of the technology involved is fundamental to crafting good policy, there’s little involvement of technologists in policy discussions.</p><p>This isn’t sustainable. We need public interest technologists: people from our fields helping craft policy and providing security to agencies and groups working in the broader public interest. We need them in government, at NGOs, teaching at universities, as part of the press, and inside private companies. This is increasingly critical to both public safety and overall social welfare</p><p>In this <i>Spotlight on Cloud</i>, find out about the current state of public interest technology and to discover a way forward, for us individually and collectively for our field.</p><p>Recorded on December 5, 2019.

This IBM Redpaper publication helps you set up and configure the new cloud object storage support for IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) or Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p><p>The TS7700 supported off loading to physical tape for over two decades. Off loading to physical tape behind a TS7700 is used by hundreds of organizations around the world. By using the same hierarchical storage techniques, the TS7700 can also off load to object storage. Because object storage is cloud-based and accessible from different regions, the TS7760 Cloud Storage Tier support essentially allows the cloud to be an extension of the grid.</p><p>In this IBM Redpaper publication, we provide a brief overview of cloud technology with an emphasis on Object Storage. Object Storage is used by a broad set of technologies, including those technologies that are exclusive to IBM Z®. </p><p>The aim of this publication is to provide a basic understanding of cloud, Object Storage, and different ways it can be integrated into your environment. </p><p>This Redpaper is intended for system architects and storage administrators with TS7700 experience who want to add the support of a Cloud Storage Tier to their TS7700 solution.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>To remain competitive in today’s digital world, large businesses need to move fast. That’s why so many companies plan to shift from monolithic onsite architectures to applications designed solely to operate on cloud computing platforms. But the question remains: exactly how do companies successfully migrate toward cloud-native technologies and practices?</p><p>According to the Cloud Platform Survey conducted by O’Reilly Media and Dynatrace in 2016, 92% of respondents anticipate that their organizations will go cloud-native within the next 5 years. Based on their experience, Dynatrace identifies three stages that businesses move through on their journey to the cloud. This report details each stage of the strategy, and includes case studies that show you how to tackle problems that are both technical and cultural. You’ll also get a summary of responses to the survey.</p><p>The cloud migration strategy includes:</p><ul><li>Stage one: migrate existing applications to virtualized infrastructure with a lift-and-shift approach and implement an automated continuous integration/continuous delivery pipeline</li><li>Stage two: move your monolithic application toward microservice architectures, with services running in containers on a PaaS service</li><li>Stage three: Shift toward dynamic, rapidly scaling microservices and deploy services across the cloud platform’s software-defined architecture</li></ul><p>Anna Gerber is a core member of NodeBotsAU. She is also a Technical Project Manager with the ITEE eResearch Group at the University of Queensland, Australia. She can be found on Twitter @annagerber.</p><p>Peter Putz is the Operations Lead of the Dynatrace Innovation Lab. He and his team spearhead technology research and business development efforts for next generation Digital Performance Monitoring solutions.</p></div></span>",

A preinstalled IBM Spectrum™ Scale 5.0.3 cluster file system provides back-end storage for the persistent volumes bound to the database.</p><p>A container is a standard unit of software that packages code and all its dependencies, so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. By default, containers are ephemeral. However, stateful applications, such as databases, require some type of persistent storage that can survive service restarts or container crashes.</p><p>IBM provides several products helping organizations build an environment on an IBM Z infrastructure to develop and manage containerized applications, including dynamic provisioning of persistent volumes.</p><p>As an example for a stateful application, this paper describes how to deploy the relational database MariaDB using a Helm chart. The IBM Spectrum Scale V5.0.3 cluster file system is providing back-end storage for the persistent volumes.</p><p>This document provides step-by-step guidance regarding how to install and configure the following components:<br/></p><ul><br/><li>IBM Cloud Private 3.1.2 (including Kubernetes)<br/></li><li>Docker 18.03.1-ce<br/></li><li>IBM Storage Enabler for Containers 2.0.0 and 2.1.0 <br/></li></ul><br/>This Redpaper demonstrates how we set up the example for a stateful application in our lab.

But one area companies often overlook is Internet performance: optimizing the route that data takes across the public Internet to reach your systems, a stretch known as the middle mile.</p><p>In this report, author and middle-mile expert Andy Still maps your cloud journey from initial preparation to having your own highly performant cloud-based system. At each stage, you’ll learn the best methods for optimizing Internet performance by understanding the nature of your application, the characteristics of your end users, and the way various cloud providers can connect one to the other.</p><p>Not all cloud vendors are created equally and, despite what they’d like you to think, it’s not necessary to tie yourself to a single provider. Pick up a copy of this report and learn why the best Internet performance may involve using a combination of components from multiple cloud vendors.</p></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Today, organizations are responding to market demands and regulatory requirements faster than ever by extending their applications and data to new digital applications. This drive to deliver new functions at speed has paved the way for a huge growth in cloud and microservices applications, such as those hosted in IBM® Cloud. One of the most widely adopted ways to integrate cloud applications with enterprise application logic and business data is the use of application programming interfaces (APIs).</p><p>By extending enterprise applications to form a hybrid cloud environment, you can capitalize on investments in on-premises services whilst taking advantage of the benefits of public cloud services. Over 90% of new client-facing apps rely on application logic and data services from mainframes, meaning IBM Z® is a critical service provider for cloud applications; for example, through REST APIs. These same APIs can be used through other channels and applications on-premises and in the cloud.</p><p>Many technologies and solutions can be used to enable cloud integration with the mainframe, including web APIs, services, connectors, messaging, and so on. The primary goal of this IBM Redpaper™ publication is to help IT architects choose between the many application integration architectures and solutions and make the best choice based on the specific requirements of the project.</p><p>This paper outlines some of the business imperatives and challenges. Then, it reviews the main architecture options and the key considerations for planning API-enablement of the mainframe and provides guidance for when to use specific solutions. Finally, it documents several API integration scenarios to show how these technologies are used in the real world.</p></span>",

This book, however, explains the cloud from the user's viewpoint -- the business user's in particular. Nayan Ruparelia explains what the cloud is, when to use it (and when not to), how to select a cloud service, how to integrate it with other technologies, and what the best practices are for using cloud computing.</p>\n\n<p>Cutting through the hype, Ruparelia cites the simple and basic definition of cloud computing from the National Institute of Science and Technology: a model enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources. Thus with cloud computing, businesses can harness information technology resources usually available only to large enterprises. And this, Ruparelia demonstrates, represents a paradigm shift for business. It will ease funding for startups, alter business plans, and allow big businesses greater agility.</p>\n\n<p>Ruparelia discusses the key issues for any organization considering cloud computing: service level agreements, business service delivery and consumption, finance, legal jurisdiction, security, and social responsibility. He introduces novel concepts made possible by cloud computing: cloud cells, or specialist clouds for specific uses; the personal cloud; the cloud of things; and cloud service exchanges. He examines use case patterns in terms of infrastructure and platform, software information, and business process; and he explains how to transition to a cloud service. Current and future users will find this book an indispensable guide to the cloud.</p></span>",

At the end of this module you should have a better idea of where the various technologies fit and why the Cloud is so important in driving a new business model, flexibility, and agility.<br/><br/><strong>Module 2: Cloud Technologies</strong><br/>\n This module explores Cisco Cloud automation and orchestration platforms like Cisco Enterprise Cloud suite, Cloud Self Service Portal and management applications, and Cloud infrastructure that can be integrated into and controlled by the Cloud. <br/><br/><strong>Module 3: Cloud Administration and Operations</strong><br/>\n Now that we have all the background stuff out of the way, it is time to dive into the operational and administrative side of the Cloud. This module covers how to manage users and groups, virtual machine management with UCSD, how to deploy virtual app containers, the role of UCSD and the prime services catalog working together in delivering a self-services catalog to end users, and provisioning a new service with PSC and verifying the new service operation. Last but not least, we discuss how to deploy the intercloud fabric. <br/><br/><strong>Module 4: Cloud Monitoring and Reporting</strong><br/>\n Monitoring and reporting on the function and utilization of your Cloud environment are crucial components for delivering the Cloud to end users. Not only can you react faster to issues, you can also proactively manage capacity and resources to deliver optimal performance. In addition, many IT departments utilize a chargeback system to help “pay for” Cloud services. This is how a budget is allocated to IT, which means more money to do new projects. This lesson covers all these topics in preparation for the exam.<br/><br/><strong>Module 5: Cloud Troubleshooting</strong><br/>\n This module covers how to go about troubleshooting Cloud issues, and foundational technologies you need to deploy in your environment to get to the root cause of a problem. The lessons in this module also discuss fault monitoring, reviewing logs, and configuring and restoring backups. <br/><br/><strong>About LiveLessons Video Training</strong><br/>\n LiveLessons Video Training series publishes hundreds of hands-on, expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

In modern businesses the same cloud-based data stores and applications might be accessed by hundreds of different applications from thousands of different devices via APIs. To make this happen, APIs must be wired together i.e. integrated. Oracle Integration Cloud Service provides a complete method for integrating enterprise applications in the cloud. Integration Cloud Service (ICS) provides a cloud hosted means to integrate systems together using a graphical means to define and represent integrations.</p><p>This book will be a comprehensive, hands-on guide to building successful, high-availability integrations on ICS. This book sets out to demonstrate how ICS can be used to effectively implement integrations that work both in the cloud and on premise. It starts with a fast, practical introduction to what ICS can do for your business and then shows how ICS allows you to develop integrations not only quickly but in a way that means they are maintainable and extensible. Gradually it moves into more advanced integrations, showing how to achieve sophisticated results with ICS and work with external applications. Finally the book shows you how to monitor cloud apps and go beyond ICS to build even more powerful integrated applications.</p><p>By the end of the book, you will the knowledge on how to use ICS to solve your own integration needs and harness the technologies in a maintainable and sustainable manner.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This book will take a pragmatic approach and will be a business-focused guide to delivering business value with ICS.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book.

    "title": "Reliability Assurance of Big Data in the Cloud",
    "description": "<span><p>With the rapid growth of Cloud computing, the size of Cloud data is expanding at a dramatic speed. A huge amount of data is generated and processed by Cloud applications, putting a higher demand on cloud storage. While data reliability should already be a requirement, data in the Cloud needs to be stored in a highly cost-effective manner. This book focuses on the trade-off between data storage cost and data reliability assurance for big data in the Cloud. Throughout the whole Cloud data lifecycle, four major features are presented: first, a novel generic data reliability model for describing data reliability in the Cloud; second, a minimum replication calculation approach for meeting a given data reliability requirement to facilitate data creation; third, a novel cost-effective data reliability assurance mechanism for big data maintenance, which could dramatically reduce the storage space needed in the Cloud; fourth, a cost-effective strategy for facilitating data creation and recovery, which could significantly reduce the energy consumption during data transfer.</p><ul><li>Captures data reliability with variable disk rates and compares virtual to physical disks</li><li>Offers methods for reducing cloud-based storage cost and energy consumption</li><li>Presents a minimum replication benchmark for data reliability requirements to evaluate various replication-based data storage approaches </li></ul></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>When people hear “the Cloud,” they think of cloud computing, just a sliver of what the Cloud is today. The Cloud has grown: it represents the consummate disruptor to structure; a pervasive social and economic network that will soon connect and define more of the world than any other political, social, or economic organization. The Cloud is the first megatrend of the twenty-first century, one that will shape the way we will address virtually every challenge we face for at least the next 100 years. It is where we will all live, work, and play in the coming decades. The Cloud is where your kids go to dive into online play. It's where you meet and make friends in social networks. It's where companies find the next big idea. It's where political campaigns are won and lost. Cloud Surfing is the groundbreaking book that will explain how to access the full value of the Cloud and how to embrace its possibilities.</p></span>",

It starts with a discussion of the media hype around cloud computing and attempt to pull together what industry experts are saying in order to create a unified definition. Once this foundation is created—assisting the reader's understanding of what cloud computing is—the discussion moves to getting business benefits from cloud computing. Lastly, the discussion focuses on examples of cloud computing, public clouds, private clouds, and virtualization. The book emphasizes how these technologies can be used to create business value and how they can be integrated into an organizations business intelligence system. It helps the user make a business case for cloud computing applications—applications that are used to gather/create data, which in turn are used to generate business intelligence.</p></span></span></span>",

    "title": "The Myth of Private Equity",
    "description": "<span><p>Once an obscure niche of the investment world, private equity has grown into a juggernaut, with consequences for a wide range of industries as well as the financial markets. Private equity funds control companies that represent trillions of dollars in assets, millions of employees, and the well-being of thousands of institutional investors and their beneficiaries. Even as the ruthlessness of some funds has made private equity a poster child for the harms of unfettered capitalism, many aspects of the industry remain opaque, hidden from the normal bounds of accountability.</p>\n\n<p>The Myth of Private Equity is a hard-hitting and meticulous expose from an insider's viewpoint. Jeffrey C. Hooke-a former private equity executive and investment banker-examines the negative effects of private equity and the ways in which it has avoided scrutiny. He unravels the exaggerations that the industry has spun to its customers and the business media, showing the stark realities that are concealed by the funds' self-mythologizing and penchant for secrecy. Hooke details the flaws in private equity's investment strategies, critically examines its day-to-day operations, and reveals the broad spectrum of its enablers. An essential listen for both the financial profession and the broader public, this book pulls back the curtain on one of the most controversial areas of finance.</p></span>",

The document briefly introduces Operational Decision Manager on z/OS and Machine learning on z/OS. In the case of Machine Learning we focus on the aspect of real-time scoring models and how these can be used with Business Rules to give better decisions.</p><p><b>Note: Important changes since this document was written: </b><br/>This document was written for an older release of Operational Decision Manager for z/OS (ODM for z/OS). ODM for z/OS 8.9.1 required the writing of custom Java code to access a Watson Machine Learning for z/OS Scoring Service (this can be seen in ). Since that time ODM for z/OS version 8.10.1 has been released and much improves the integration experience. Integrating the two products no longer requires custom Java code. Using ODM for z/OS 8.10.1 or later you can use an automated wizard in the ODM tooling to:<br/></p><ul><br/><li>Browse and select a model from Watson Machine Learning </li><br/><li>Import the Machine Learning data model into your rule project </li><br/><li>Automatically generate a template rule that integrates a call to the Watson Machine Learning scoring service </li><br/></ul><p>Download and read this document for:<br/></p><ul><br/><li>Individual introductions to ODM for z/OS and Machine learning </li><br/><li>Discussions on the benefits of using the two technologies together </li><br/><li>Information on integrating if you have not yet updated to ODM for z/OS 8.10.1</li><br/></ul><p>For information about the machine learning integration in ODM for z/OS 8.10.1 see \"IBM Watson Machine Learning for z/OS integration\" topic in the ODM for z/OS 8.10.x Knowledge Center at:<br/>https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSQP76_8.10.x/com.ibm.odm.zos.develop/topics/con_ml_integration_overview.html</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Although the use of cloud computing platforms and applications has expanded rapidly, most books on the subject focus on high-level concepts. There has long been a need for a book that provides detailed guidance on how to develop secure clouds.<br/><br/>Filling this void,<strong> Developing and Securing the Cloud </strong>provides<strong> </strong>a comprehensive overview of cloud computing technology. Supplying step-by-step instruction on how to develop and secure cloud computing platforms and web services, it includes an easy-to-understand, basic-level overview of cloud computing and its supporting technologies.<br/><br/>Presenting a framework for secure cloud computing development, the book describes supporting technologies for the cloud such as web services and security. It details the various layers of the cloud computing framework, including the virtual machine monitor and hypervisor, cloud data storage, cloud data management, and virtual network monitor. It also provides several examples of cloud products and prototypes, including private, public, and U.S. government clouds.<br/><br/>Reviewing recent developments in cloud computing, the book illustrates the essential concepts, issues, and challenges in developing and securing today’s cloud computing platforms and applications. It also examines prototypes built on experimental cloud computing systems that the author and her team have developed at the University of Texas at Dallas.<br/><br/>This diverse reference is suitable for those in industry, government, and academia. Technologists will develop the understanding required to select the appropriate tools for particular cloud applications. Developers will discover alternative designs for cloud development, and managers will understand if it’s best to build their own clouds or contract them out.</p></span>",

The superscalar design allows z14 servers to\ndeliver a record level of capacity over the prior IBM Z platforms.\nIn its maximum configuration, z14 is powered by up to 170 client\ncharacterizable microprocessors (cores) running at 5.2 GHz. This\nconfiguration can run more than 146,000 million instructions per\nsecond (MIPS) and up to 32 TB of client memory. The IBM z14\nModel M05 is estimated to provide up to 35% more total system\ncapacity than the IBM z13® Model NE1.</p><p>This Redbooks publication provides information about IBM z14 and\nits functions, features, and associated software support. More\ninformation is offered in areas that are relevant to technical\nplanning. It is intended for systems engineers, consultants,\nplanners, and anyone who wants to understand the IBM Z servers\nfunctions and plan for their usage. It is intended as an\nintroduction to mainframes. Readers are expected to be generally\nfamiliar with existing IBM Z technology and terminology.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Abstract</p><p>It's easy to look at the title of a book and think \"that's old\nnews\" or \"I already know all there is to know on that subject.\" But\nbefore you dismiss this publication, consider just how far the IBM®\nParallel Sysplex® architecture has come. From the early days the\nmainframe has embraced a shared everything approach. The original\ndesigners coded IBM z/OS® (called IBM MVS™ or IBM OS/390® back\nthen) with the functionality necessary for the operating system to\ncreate the repositories, manage the data flow, and ensure the\nintegrity of the systems involved. From there, the middleware\nsystems provided the exploitation and advanced functions to mature\nthe technology. The component in the middle of all this great\ntechnology can easily be taken for granted. That is the IBM\nCoupling Facility.</p><p>This IBM Redbooks® publication discusses both traditional uses\nfor the IBM Coupling Facility technology and new ways to use it\nwith products such as IBM CICS®. You can learn how to perform new\nfunctions and have these functions benefit from the scalability and\navailability achieved only in a mainframe ecosystem.</p><p>Open standards are a large part of considerations today, as most\ncompanies run IT shops with a mix of technology components. As the\nworld embraces these technologies, it is necessary to understand\nhow to mix the world of mainframe architectures and products with\nother open architectures. This mix allows the best tool to be used\nto solve processing needs, at the right cost and service\nlevels.</p><p>Often the functions needed for modern processing can be found in\nhouse, in places where staff are skilled and that already deliver\nthe robust production environments you count on daily. This book\ndiscusses these modern functions and how to achieve them with CICS\nuse of the IBM Coupling Facility. You will learn how one IBM\nclient, Walmart, took these concepts far beyond the original design\nas they share their experiences and even share code examples to\nhelp you get started.</p><p>The last chapter of this book shows what can be achieved when a\ncombination of old and new functions are use together. Even if you\nhave familiarity with what could be done with the IBM Coupling\nFacility in the past, there is much to learn and deploy in a modern\nworld.</p><p>Those who are familiar with the IBM Coupling Facility might find\nthe content of this book helpful. Additionally, readers who are\nconsidering how to use the IBM Coupling Facility technology within\ntheir environment might also find useful information in the\nchapters that follow</p></span>",

Open Platform\nfor DBaaS on Power Systems is an on-demand, secure, and scalable\nself-service database platform that automates provisioning and\nadministration of databases to support new business applications\nand information insights.</p><p>This publication addresses topics to help sellers, architects,\nbrand specialists, distributors, resellers and anyone offering\nsecure and scalable Open Platform for DBaaS on Power Systems\nsolution with APIs that are consistent across heterogeneous open\ndatabase types. An Open Platform for DBaaS on Power Systems\nsolution has the capability to accelerate business success by\nproviding an infrastructure, and tools leveraging Open Source and\nOpenStack software engineered to optimize hardware and software\nbetween workloads and resources so you have a responsive, and an\nadaptive environment. Moreover, this publication provides\ndocumentation to transfer the how-to-skills for cloud oriented\noperational management of Open Platform for DBaaS on Power Systems\nservice and underlying infrastructure to the technical teams.</p><p>Open Platform for DBaaS on Power Systems mission is to provide\nscalable and reliable cloud database as a service provisioning\nfunctionality for both relational and non-relational database\nengines, and to continue to improve its fully-featured and\nextensible open source framework. For example, Trove is a database\nas a service for OpenStack. It is designed to run entirely on\nOpenStack, with the goal of allowing users to quickly and easily\nutilize the features of a relational or non-relational database\nwithout the burden of handling complex administrative tasks. Cloud\nusers and database administrators can provision and manage multiple\ndatabase instances as needed. Initially, the service focuses on\nproviding resource isolation at high performance while automating\ncomplex administrative tasks including deployment, configuration,\npatching, backups, restores, and monitoring.</p><p>In the context of this publication, the monitoring tool\nimplemented is Nagios Core which is an open source monitoring tool.\nHence, when you see a reference of Nagios in this book, Nagios Core\nis the open source monitoring solution implemented. Also note that\nthe implementation of Open Platform for DBaaS on IBM Power Systems\nis based on open source solutions.</p><p>This book is targeted toward sellers, architects, brand\nspecialists, distributors, resellers and anyone developing and\nimplementing Open Platform for DBaaS on Power Systems\nsolutions.</p></span>",

    "title": "A Polygeneration Process Concept for Hybrid Solar and Biomass Power Plant",
    "description": "<span><p>The global warming phenomenon as a significant sustainability issue is gaining worldwide support for development of renewable energy technologies. The term “polygeneration” is referred to as “an energy supply system, which delivers more than one form of energy to the final user.”  For example, electricity, cooling and desalination can be delivered from a polygeneration process. The polygeneration process in a hybrid solar thermal power plant can deliver electricity with less impact on the environment compared to a conventional fossil fuel-based power generating system. It is also THE next generation energy production technique with the potential to overcome the undesirable intermittence of renewable energy systems.</p><p>In this study, the polygeneration process simultaneous production of power, vapor absorption refrigeration (VAR) cooling and multi-effect humidification and dehumidification (MEHD) desalination system from different heat sources in hybrid solar-biomass (HSB) system with higher energy efficiencies (energy and exergy), primary energy savings (PES) and payback period are investigated, focusing on several aspects associated with hybrid solar-biomass power generation installations, such as wide availability of biomass resources and solar direct normal irradiance (DNI), and other technologies.  Thermodynamic evaluation (energy and exergy) of HSB power has also been investigated, along with the VAR cooling system, the modelling, simulation, optimization and cost analysis of the polygeneration hybrid solar biomass system, all accompanied by multiple case studies and examples for practical applications.</p><p>This volume provides the researcher, student and engineer with the intellectual tool needed for understanding new ideas in this rapidly emerging field. The book is also intended to serve as a general source and reference book for the professional (consultant, designer, contractor etc.) who is working in the field of solar thermal, biomass, power plant, polygeneration, cooling and process heat.  It is a must-have for anyone working in this field.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Cloud computing is fast emerging as a new consumption and\ndelivery model for IT solutions. Two distinct cloud patterns have\nevolved. Private clouds are custom cloud applications that are on\npremise to companies. Public clouds are owned and managed by a\nservice provider and are delivered on a pay-per-use basis. Although\nthe debate between the use of private versus public cloud\ncontinues, the industry is moving ever faster toward a hybrid\nsolution. Hybrid clouds address the integration of traditional IT\nenvironments with one or more clouds, private and public.</p><p>IBM® WebSphere® Cast Iron® along with the IBM\nTivoli® Service Management Extensions for Hybrid Cloud\nsupports the integration of private and public clouds.The Service\nManagement Extensions for Hybrid Cloud supports the following\nscenarios:<br/></p><li><p>Provisioning hybrid cloud resources<br/></p></li><li><p>Monitoring hybrid cloud resources<br/></p></li><li><p>Governing and managing workloads that use hybrid cloud\nresources<br/></p></li><li><p><p>Provisioning users from LDAP to IBM LotusLive™<br/></p>\n\nThis IBM Redbooks® publication is intended for application\nintegrators, integration designers, and administrators evaluating\nor using IBM WebSphere Cast Iron.

The high availability, multiplatform support,\nincluding IBM Z, and simplified management tools help provide a\ncost-effective path to an on-demand and cloud-based\ninfrastructures.</p><p>The IBM DS8880 family now offers business-critical, all-flash,\nand hybrid data systems that span a wide range of price\npoints:<br/></p><br/><li><p>DS8884 -- Business Class<br/></p></li><li><p>DS8886 -- Enterprise Class<br/></p></li><li><p>DS8888 -- Analytics Class<br/></p></li><p><br/>\nThe DS8884 and DS8886 are available as either hybrid models, or can\nbe configured as all-flash. Each model represents the most recent\nin this series of high-performance, high-capacity, flexible, and\nresilient storage systems. These systems are intended to address\nthe needs of the most demanding clients.</p><p>Two powerful IBM POWER8® processor-based servers manage the\ncache to streamline disk I/O, maximizing performance and\nthroughput. These capabilities are further enhanced with the\navailability of the second generation of high-performance flash\nenclosures (HPFEs Gen-2) and newer flash drives.</p><p>Like its predecessors, the DS8880 supports advanced disaster\nrecovery (DR) solutions, business continuity solutions, and thin\nprovisioning. All disk drives in the DS8880 storage system include\nthe Full Disk Encryption (FDE) feature. The DS8880 can\nautomatically optimize the use of each storage tier, particularly\nflash drives, by using the IBM Easy Tier® feature.</p></span>",
