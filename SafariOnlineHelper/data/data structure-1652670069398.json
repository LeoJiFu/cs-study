    "description": "<span><span><p><strong>20 Hours of Video Instruction</strong><br/><br/><strong>Data Science Fundamentals LiveLessons</strong> teaches you the foundational concepts, theory, and techniques you need to know to become an effective data scientist. The videos present you with applied, example-driven lessons in Python and its associated ecosystem of libraries, where you get your hands dirty with real datasets and see real results.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Description</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nIf nothing else, by the end of this video course you will have analyzed a number of datasets from the wild, built a handful of applications, and applied machine learning algorithms in meaningful ways to get real results. And along the way you learn the best practices and computational techniques used by a professional data scientist. More specifically, you learn how to acquire data that is openly accessible on the Internet by working with APIs. You learn how to parse XML and JSON data to load it into a relational database. </p><p>About the Instructor</p><p><strong>Jonathan Dinu</strong> is an author, researcher, and most importantly, an educator. He is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon's Human Computer Interaction Institute (HCII), where he is working to democratize machine learning and artificial intelligence through interpretable and interactive algorithms. Previously, he founded Zipfian Academy (an immersive data science training program acquired by Galvanize), has taught classes at the University of San Francisco, and has built a Data Visualization MOOC with Udacity. In addition to his professional data science experience, he has run data science trainings for a Fortune 500 company and taught workshops at Strata, PyData, and DataWeek (among others). He first discovered his love of all things data while studying Computer Science and Physics at UC Berkeley, and in a former life he worked for Alpine Data Labs developing distributed machine learning algorithms for predictive analytics on Hadoop.<br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan has always had a passion for sharing the things he has learned in the most creative ways he can. When he is not working with students, you can find him blogging about data, visualization, and education at <a href=\"http://hepm.pearsoned.com/hopelessoptimism.com\" target=\"\" title=\"\">hopelessoptimism.com</a> or rambling on Twitter @jonathandinu.</p><p><strong>Skill Level</strong></p><ul><li>Beginner</li></ul><strong>What You Will Learn</strong><br/><ul><li>How to get up and running with a Python data science environment</li><li>The essentials of Python 3, including object-oriented programming</li><li>The basics of the data science process and what each step entails</li><li>How to build a simple (yet powerful) recommendation engine for Airbnb listings</li><li>Where to find quality data sources and how to work with APIs programmatically</li><li>Strategies for parsing JSON and XML into a structured form</li><li>The basics of relational databases and how to use an ORM to interface with them in Python</li><li>Best practices of data validation, including common data quality checks</li></ul><strong>Who Should Take This Course</strong><br/><ul><li>Aspiring data scientists looking to break into the field and learn the essentials necessary</li><li>Journalists, consultants, analysts, or anyone else who works with data and looking to take a programmatic approach to exploring data and conducting analyses</li><li>Quantitative researchers interested in applying theory to real projects and taking a computational approach to modeling.</li><li>Software engineers interested in building intelligent applications driven by machine learning</li><li>Practicing data scientists already familiar with another programming environment looking to learn how to do data science with Python</li></ul><strong>Course Requirements</strong><br/><ul><li>Basic understanding of programming</li><li>Familiarity with Python and statistics are a plus</li></ul><strong>Lesson Descriptions</strong><br/><br/><strong>Lesson 1: Introduction to Data Science with Python</strong><br/><br/>\nLesson 1 begins with a working definition of data science (as we use it in the course), gives a brief history of the field, and provides motivating examples of data science products and applications. This lesson covers how to get set up with a data science programming environment locally, as well as gives you a crash course in the Python programming language if you are unfamiliar with it or are coming from another language such as R. Finally, it ends with an overview of the concepts and tools that the rest of the lessons cover to hopefully motivate you for and excite you about what's to come!<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 2: The Data Science Process—Building Your First Application</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nLesson 2 introduces the data science process by walking through an end-to-end example of building your very first data science application, an AirBnB listing recommender.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou continue to learn how to work with and manipulate data in Python, without any external libraries yet, and leverage the power of the built-in Python standard library. The core application of this lesson covers the basics of building a recommendation engine and shows you how, with simple statistics and a little ingenuity, you can build a compelling recommender, given the right data. And finally, it ends with a formal treatment of the data science process and the individual steps it entails.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 3: Acquiring Data—Sources and Methods</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nLesson 3 begins the treatment of each of the specific stages of the data science process, starting with the first: data acquisition. The lesson covers the basics of finding the appropriate data source for your problem and how to download the datasets you need once you have found them.<br/>\n<br/>\nStarting with an overview of how the infrastructure behind the Internet works, you learn how to programmatically make HTTP requests in Python to access data through APIs, as well as the basics of two of the most common data formats: JSON and XML. The lesson ends by setting up the dataset we use for the rest of the course: Foursquare Venues.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorking with the Foursquare dataset, you learn how to interact with APIs and do some minor web scraping. You also learn how to find and acquire data from a variety of sources and keep track of its lineage all along the way. You learn to put yourself in the data science mindset and how to see the data (hidden in plain sight) that we interact with every day.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 4: Adding Structure—Data Parsing and Storage</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nLesson 4 picks up with the second stage of what traditionally is referred to as an extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipeline, adding structure through the transformation of raw data.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou see how to work with a variety of data formats, including XML and JSON, by parsing the data we have acquired to eventually load it into an environment better-suited to exploration and analysis: a relational database. But before we load our data into a database, we take a short diversion to talk about how to conceptually model structure in data with code. You get a primer in object-oriented programming and learn how to leverage it to create abstractions and data models that define how you can interface with your data.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 5: Storing Data: Relational Databases (with SQLite)</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nLesson 5 starts with an introduction to one of the most ubiquitous data technologies—the relational database. The lesson serves as an end cap to the ETL pipeline of the previous videos. You learn the ins and outs of the various strategies for storing data and see how to map the abstractions you created in Python to database tables through the use of an object-relational mapper (ORM). By being able to query and manipulate data with Python while persisting data in a database reliably, the interface ORMs provide gives you the best of both worlds.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lesson 6: Data Validation and Exploration<br/>\n</strong><br/>\nLesson 6 starts by showing you how to effectively query your data to understand what it contains, uncover any biases it might contain, and learn the best practices of dealing with missing values. After you have validated the quality of the data, you use descriptive statistics to learn how your data is distributed as well as learn the limits of point statistics (or rather single number estimates) and why it is often necessary to use visual techniques.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>About LiveLessons Video Training</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nThe LiveLessons Video Training series publishes hundreds of hands-on, expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

In this fast-paced and thorough discussion of how to plan for, implement, and run a successful data governance program, you'll get an overview of the ways data has been managed in the past and how the smart companies do it now. Along with an introduction to the operational frameworks used in data governance, Adler describes the roles of the Chief Data Officer and the Data Steward, outlines a set of commonly used policies and standards, and shows you how to build the business case for a data governance program. (If people in your company are suspicious of the term “data governance,\" you'll also learn some alternative terms many companies use to socialize and gain acceptance for their data governance programs.)  Watch this video and you’ll exit the data maze with a fundamental understanding of the origins, business goals, conceptual structure, and value of data governance.</p><ul><li>    Review the business and technology trends that drive the requirement for data governance</li><li>    Learn about the tools, technologies, and frameworks used in successful data governance programs</li><li> Understand the roles and responsibilities of the key players in data governance</li><li> Discover the best ways to plan, implement, and run a data governance program</li><li>    Understand the impact that agile development and Big Data collection technologies have on data governance</li></ul><p>John Adler, CRISC, PMP, MBA, runs the Data Management Group. For the past twenty years, he’s helped government agencies and Fortune 500 companies with their enterprise data management and data governance strategies and projects. </p></div></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Explore data structures and algorithm concepts and their relation to everyday JavaScript development. A basic understanding of these ideas is essential to any JavaScript developer wishing to analyze and build great software solutions.  </p><p>You'll discover how to implement data structures such as hash tables, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. You'll also learn how a URL shortener, such as bit.ly, is developed and what is happening to the data as a PDF is uploaded to a webpage. This book covers the practical applications of data structures and algorithms to encryption, searching, sorting, and pattern matching. </p>It is crucial for JavaScript developers to understand how data structures work and how to design algorithms. This book and the accompanying code provide that essential foundation for doing so. With <i>JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms </i>you can<i> </i>start developing your knowledge and applying it to your JavaScript projects today. <p></p><p><b>What You'll Learn</b></p><ul><li>Review core data structure fundamentals: arrays, linked-lists, trees, heaps, graphs, and hash-table</li><li>Review core algorithm fundamentals: search, sort, recursion, breadth/depth first search, dynamic programming, bitwise operators<br/></li><li>Examine how the core data structure and algorithms knowledge fits into context of JavaScript explained using prototypical inheritance and native JavaScript objects/data types<br/></li><li>Take a high-level look at commonly used design patterns in JavaScript<br/></li></ul><p><b>Who This Book Is For </b></p><p>Existing web developers and software engineers seeking to develop or revisit their fundamental data structures knowledge; beginners and students studying JavaScript independently or via a course or coding bootcamp.</p><div><br/></div></span>",

These patterns can be used to considerably reduce modeling time and cost, to jump-start data modeling efforts, as standards and guidelines to increase data model consistency and quality, and as an objective source against which an enterprise can evaluate data models.<br/><strong>Praise for <em>The Data Model Resource Book, Volume 3</em></strong></p><p>\"Len and Paul look beneath the superficial issues of data modeling and have produced a work that is a must for every serious designer and manager of an IT project.\"<br/></p><p>\"<em>The Data Model Resource Book, Volume 3: Universal Patterns for Data Modeling</em> is a great source for reusable patterns you can use to save a tremendous amount of time, effort, and cost on any data modeling effort. Len Silverston and Paul Agnewhave provided an indispensable reference of very high-quality patterns for the most foundational types of datamodel structures. This book represents a revolutionary leap in moving the data modeling profession forward.\"<br/>—<strong>Ron Powell</strong>, Cofounder and Editorial Director of the Business Intelligence Network</p><p>\"After we model a Customer, Product, or Order, there is still more about each of these that remains to be captured, such as roles they play, classifications in which they belong, or states in which they change. <em>The Data Model Resource Book, Volume 3: Universal Patterns for Data Modeling</em> clearly illustrates these common structures. Len Silverston and Paul Agnew have created a valuable addition to our field, allowing us to improve the consistency and quality of our models by leveraging the many common structures within this text.\"<br/>—<strong>Steve Hoberman</strong>, Best-Selling Author of <em>Data Modeling Made Simple</em></p><p>\"The large national health insurance company I work at has actively used these data patterns and the (Universal Data Models) UDM, ahead of this book, through Len Silverston’s UDM Jump Start engagement. The patterns have found their way into the core of our Enterprise Information Model, our data warehouse designs, and progressively into key business function databases. We are getting to reuse the patterns across projects and are reaping benefits in understanding, flexibility, and time-to-market. Thanks so much.\"<br/>—<strong>David Chasteen</strong>, Enterprise Information Architect</p><p>\"Reusing proven data modeling design patterns means exactly that. Data models become stable, but remain very flexible to accommodate changes. We have had the fortune of having Len and Paul share the patterns that are described in this book via our engagements with Universal Data Models, LLC. These data modeling design patterns have helped us to focus on the essential business issues because we have leveraged these reusable building blocks for many of the standard design problems. These design patterns have also helped us to evaluate the quality of data models for their intended purpose. Many times there are a lot of enhancements required. Too often the very specialized business-oriented data model is also implemented physically. This may have significant drawbacks to flexibility. I’m looking forward to increasing the data modeling design pattern competence within Nokia with the help of this book.\"<br/>—<strong>Teemu Mattelmaki</strong>, Chief Information Architect, Nokia</p><p>\"Once again, Len Silverston, this time together with Paul Agnew, has made a valuable contribution to the body of knowledge about datamodels, and the act of building sound data models. As a professional data modeler, and teacher of data modeling for almost three decades, I have always been aware that I had developed some familiar mental \"patterns\" which I acquired very early in my data modeling experience. When teaching data modeling, we use relatively simple workshops, but they are carefully designed so the students will see and acquire a lot of these basic \"patterns\" — templates that they will recognize and can use to interpret different subject matter into data model form quickly and easily. I’ve always used these patterns in the course of facilitating data modeling sessions; I was able to recognize \"Ah, this is just like . . .,\" and quickly apply a pattern that I’d seen before. But, in all this time, I’ve never sat down and clearly categorized and documented what each of these “patterns’’ actually was in such a way that they could be easily and clearly communicated to others; Len and Paul have done exactly that. As in the other Data Model Resource Books, the thinking and writing is extraordinarily clear and understandable. I personally would have been very proud to have authored this book, and I sincerely applaud Len and Paul for another great contribution to the art and science of data modeling. It will be of great value to any data modeler.\"<br/>—<strong>William G. Smith</strong>, President, William G. Smith &amp; Associates, <code>www.williamgsmith.com</code></p><p>\"Len Silverston and Paul Agnew’s book, Universal Patterns for Data Modeling, is essential reading for anyone undertaking commercial datamodeling. With this latest volume that compiles and insightfully describes fundamental, universal data patterns, The Data Model Resource Book series represents the most important contribution to the data modeling discipline in the last decade.\"<br/>—<strong>Dr. Graeme Simsion</strong>, Author of <em>Data Modeling Essentials</em> and <em>Data Modeling Theory and Practice</em></p><p>\"Volume 3 of this trilogy is a most welcome addition to Len Silverston’s two previous books in this area. Guidance has existed for some time for those who desire to use pattern-based analysis to jump-start their data modeling efforts. Guidance exists for those who want to use generalized and industry-specific data constructs to leverage their efforts. What has been missing is guidance to those of us needing guidance to complete the roughly one-third of data models that are not generalized or industry-specific. This is where the magic of individual organizational strategies must manifest itself, and Len and Paul have done so clearly and articulately in a manner that complements the first two volumes of <em>The Data Model Resource Book</em>. By adding this book to Volumes 1 and 2 you will be gaining access to some of the most integrated data modeling guidance available on the planet.\"<br/>—<strong>Dr. Peter Aiken</strong>, Author of <em>XML in Data Management</em> and data management industry leader VCU/Data Blueprint</p></span></span>",

    "description": "In this talk, Steve will explain how to design your APIs so that they truly embrace the web and HTTP. Just as there's an impedance mismatch between our databases, our ORMs, and our models, there's an equal mismatch between our applications, our APIs, and our clients. Pros and cons of this approach will be discussed, as well as why more people aren't building APIs this way yet.",

    "description": "<span><div><p>From the moment your organization starts collecting data, it’s crucial to make key decisions about governance. What data should you gather? How do you ensure it’s accurate and current? Where do you store it, and for how long? Today, many policies for gathering and sharing data are determined in business suites, rather than by the nature of the data itself. In order to meet strategic business requirements, you must understand and define the rules that manage your organization’s data assets.</p><p>In this report, you’ll examine the many aspects of data-driven governance, particularly how this approach makes automation, enforcement, and security tasks easier. Author Federico Castanedo of Vodafone Group describes the practices and frameworks for regulatory compliance, including technology that can marry your policies to data you collect and provide fine-grained access controls.</p><p>Many businesses collect large volumes of structured, unstructured, geospatial, and other data types that often require NoSQL databases alongside relational platforms. This detailed report explores how multi-model databases support a wide range of data models against a single integrated backend, enabling your organization to easily define data-driven governance policies at scale—and ultimately to help you reduce compliance costs.</p><p>Discover a new approach that establishes governance at the data level versus the system level in order to reduce risk, facilitate operational decisions, and improve integrity.</p></div></span>",

How you want to process this amount of data? How long do you really need to keep it active for your analysis, marketing, and BI applications?</p><p>Big data is emerging from the realm of one-off projects to mainstream business adoption; however, the real value of big data is not in the overwhelming size of it, but more in its effective use.</p><p>This book addresses the following big data characteristics:</p><li><p>Very large, distributed aggregations of loosely structured data - often incomplete and inaccessible</p></li><li><p>Petabytes/Exabytes of data</p></li><li><p>Millions/billions of people providing/contributing to the context behind the data</p></li><li><p>Flat schema's with few complex interrelationships</p></li><li><p>Involves time-stamped events</p></li><li><p>Made up of incomplete data</p></li><li><p>Includes connections between data elements that must be probabilistically inferred</p></li><p><em>Big Data Imperatives</em> explains 'what big data can do'.

Big data analytics provide a platform to merge all analysis which enables data analysis to be more accurate, well-rounded, reliable and focused on a specific business capability.</p><p><em>Big Data Imperatives</em> describes the complementary nature of traditional data warehouses and big-data analytics platforms and how they feed each other. This book aims to bring the big data and analytics realms together with a greater focus on architectures that leverage the scale and power of big data and the ability to integrate and apply analytics principles to data which earlier was not accessible.</p><p>This book can also be used as a handbook for practitioners; helping them on methodology,technical architecture, analytics techniques and best practices.

    "description": "<span><span><p>This book is intended for IT professionals and students who want to learn how to design, analyze, and understand databases. The material will benefit those who want a better high-level understanding of databases such as proposal managers, architects, project managers, and even customers. The material will also benefit those who will actually design, build, and work with databases such as database designers, database administrators, and programmers. In many projects, these roles overlap so the same person may be responsible for working on the proposal, managing part of the project, and designing and creating the database.</p><p>This book is aimed at IT professionals and students of all experience levels. It does not assume that you have any previous experience with databases or programs that use them. It doesn't even assume that you have experience with computers. All you really need is a willingness and desire to learn.</p><p>This book explains database design. It tells how to plan a database's structure so the database will be robust, resistant to errors, and flexible enough to accommodate a reasonable amount of future change. It explains how to discover database requirements, build data models to study data needs, and refine those models to improve the database's effectiveness.</p><p>The book solidifies these concepts by working through a detailed example that designs a realistic database. Later chapters explain how to actually build databases using two common database products: Access 2007 and MySQL.</p><p>The book finishes by describing some of the topics you need to understand to keep a database running effectively such as database maintenance and security.</p><p>This book explains database design. It tells how to determine what should go in a database and how the database should be structured to give the best results.</p><p>This book does not focus on actually <em>creating</em> the database. The details of database construction are different for different database tools so, to remain as generally as useful as possible, this book doesn't concentrate on any particular database system. You can apply the techniques described here equally to whatever database tool you use whether it's Access, SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, or some other database product.</p><p><em>Most database products include free editions that you can use for smaller projects. For example, SQL Server Express Edition, Oracle Express Edition, and MySQL Community Server are all free.</em></p><p>To remain database neutral, the book does not assume you are using a particular database so you don't need any particular software or hardware. To work through the Exercises, all you really need is a pencil and some paper. You are welcome to type solutions into your computer if you like but you may actually find working with pencil and paper easier than using a graphical design tool to draw pictures, at least until you are comfortable with database design and are ready to pick a computerized design tool.</p><ul><li><p>\"Goals of Effective Database Design,\" explains the reasons why people and organizations use databases. It explains a database's purpose and conditions that it must satisfy to be useful. This also describes the basic ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) features that any good database should have. It explains in high-level general terms what makes a good database and what makes a bad database.</p></li><li><p>\"Database Types,\" explains some of the different types of databases that you might decide to use. These include flat files, spreadsheets, hierarchical databases (XML), object databases, and relational databases. The relational database is one of the most powerful and most commonly used forms of database so it is the focus of this book, but it is important to realize that there are alternatives that may be more appropriate under certain circumstances. This gives some tips on deciding which kind of database might be best for a particular project.</p></li><li><p>\"Relational Database Fundamentals,\" explains basic relational database concepts such as tables, rows, and columns. It explains the common usage of relational database terms in addition to the more technical terms that are sometimes used by database theorists. It describes different kinds of constraints that databases use to guarantee that the data is stored safely and consistently.</p></li><li><p>\"Understanding User Needs,\" explains how to learn about the users' needs and gather user requirements. It tells how to study the users' current operations, existing databases (if any), and desired improvements. It describes common questions that you can ask to learn about users' operations, desires, and needs, and how to build the results into requirements documents and specifications. This explains what use cases are and tells how to use them and the requirements to guide database design and to measure success.</p></li><li><p>\"Translating User Needs into Data Models,\" introduces data modeling. It explains how to translate the user's conceptual model and the requirements into other more precise models that define the database design rigorously. This describes several database modeling techniques including user-interface models, semantic object models, entity-relationship diagrams, and relational models.</p></li><li><p>\"Extracting Business Rules,\" explains how a database can handle business rules. It explains what business rules are, how they differ from database structure requirements, and how you can identify business rules. This explains the benefits of separating business rules from the database structure and tells how achieve that separation.</p></li><li><p>\"Normalizing Data,\" explains one of the biggest tools in database design: normalization. Normalization techniques allow you to restructure a database to increase its flexibility and make it more robust. This explains the various forms of normalization, emphasizing the stages that are most common and important: first, second, and third normal forms (1NF, 2NF, and 3NF). It explains how each of these kinds of normalization helps prevent errors and tells why it is sometimes better to leave a database slightly less normalized to improve performance.</p></li><li><p>\"Designing Databases to Support Software Applications,\" explains how databases fit into the larger context of application design and lifecycle. This explains how later development depends on the underlying database design. It discusses multi-tier architectures that can help decouple the application and database design so there can be at least some changes to either without requiring changes to the other.</p></li><li><p>\"Common Design Patterns,\" explains some common patterns that are useful in many applications. Some of these techniques include implementing various kinds of relationships among objects, storing hierarchical and network data, recording temporal data, and logging and locking.</p></li><li><p>\"Common Design Pitfalls,\" explains some common design mistakes that occur in database development. It describes problems that can arise from insufficient planning, incorrect normalization, and obsession with ID fields and performance.</p></li><li><p>\"User Needs and Requirements,\" walks through the steps required to analyze the users' problem, define requirements, and create use cases. It describes interviews with fictitious customers that are used to identify the application's needs and translate them into database requirements.</p></li><li><p>\"Building a Data Model,\" translates the requirements gathered in the previous into a series of data models that precisely define the database's structure. This builds user-interface models, entity-relationship diagrams, semantic object models, and relational models to refine the database's initial design. The final relational models match the structure of a relational database fairly closely so they are easy to implement.</p></li><li><p>\"Extracting Business Rules,\" identifies the business rules embedded in the relational model. It shows how to extract those rules in order to separate them logically from the database's structure. This makes the database more robust in the face of future changes to the business rules.</p></li><li><p>\"Normalization and Refinement,\" refines the relational model by normalizing it. It walks through several versions of the database that are in different normal forms. It then selects the degree of normalization that provides a reasonable tradeoff between robust design and acceptable performance.</p></li><li><p>\"Microsoft Access,\" explains how to build a database with Microsoft Access 2007. This explains enough to get started and to use Access to build non-trivial databases. You can use other versions of Access to work through this, although the locations of menus, buttons, and other Access features are different in different versions.</p></li><li><p>\"MySQL,\" explains how to build a database with MySQL. This tells where to download a free version of MySQL. It explains how to use the MySQL Command Line Client as well as some useful graphical tools including MySQL Query Browser and MySQL Workbench.</p></li><li><p>\"Introduction to SQL,\" provides an introduction to SQL (Structured Query Language). It explains how to use SQL commands to add, insert, update, and delete data. By using SQL, you can help insulate a program from the idiosyncrasies of the particular database product that it uses to store data.</p></li><li><p>\"Building Databases with SQL Scripts,\" explains how to use SQL scripts to build a database. It explains the advantages of this technique, such as the ability to create scripts to initialize a database before performing tests. It also explains some of the restrictions on this method, such as the fact that the user must create and delete tables in specific orders to satisfy table relationships.</p></li><li><p>\"Database Maintenance,\" describes some of the database maintenance issues that are part of any database application. Though performing and restoring backups, compressing tables, rebuilding indexes, and populating data warehouses are strictly not database design tasks, they are essential to any working application.</p></li><li><p>\"Database Security,\" explains database security issues. It explains the kinds of security that some database products provide. It also explains some additional techniques that can enhance database security such as using database views to appropriately restrict the users' access to data.</p></li></ul></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>Robert Sedgewick has thoroughly rewritten and substantially expanded and updated his popular work to provide current and comprehensive coverage of important algorithms and data structures. Christopher Van Wyk and Sedgewick have developed new C++ implementations that both express the methods in a concise and direct manner, and also provide programmers with the practical means to test them on real applications.</p><p>Many new algorithms are presented, and the explanations of each algorithm are much more detailed than in previous editions. A new text design and detailed, innovative figures, with accompanying commentary, greatly enhance the presentation. The third edition retains the successful blend of theory and practice that has made Sedgewick’s work an invaluable resource for more than 250,000 programmers!</p><p>This particular book, Parts 1n4, represents the essential first half of Sedgewick’s complete work.

This complete video course fills that gap--it is specifically designed to prepare students to learn how to program for Data Science and Machine Learning with Python. This is the antidote to the over-complicated universe of these hot new, growing technologies. With this course, students will learn the fundamentals of Python and get prepared specifically for Data Science.<br/>Noah Gift and Kennedy Behrman take students with zero programming background through enough Python to prepare them for their Data Science curriculum. Companies are looking for developers who can create insight-driven systems, as they are now becoming critical to business success. Very few professionals are adequately trained to handle both large-scale software engineering and Machine Learning/AI.

    "description": "<span><span><span><p><b>Create a competitive advantage with data quality</b></p><p>Data is rapidly becoming the powerhouse of industry, but low-quality data can actually put a company at a disadvantage. To be used effectively, data must accurately reflect the real-world scenario it represents, and it must be in a form that is usable and accessible. Quality data involves asking the right questions, targeting the correct parameters, and having an effective internal management, organization, and access system. It must be relevant, complete, and correct, while falling in line with pervasive regulatory oversight programs.</p><p><em>Competing with High Quality Data: Concepts, Tools and Techniques for Building a Successful Approach to Data Quality</em> takes a holistic approach to improving data quality, from collection to usage. Author Rajesh Jugulum is globally-recognized as a major voice in the data quality arena, with high-level backgrounds in international corporate finance. In the book, Jugulum provides a roadmap to data quality innovation, covering topics such as:</p><li><p>The four-phase approach to data quality control</p></li><li><p>Methodology that produces data sets for different aspects of a business</p></li><li><p>Streamlined data quality assessment and issue resolution</p></li><li><p>A structured, systematic, disciplined approach to effective data gathering</p></li><p>The book also contains real-world case studies to illustrate how companies across a broad range of sectors have employed data quality systems, whether or not they succeeded, and what lessons were learned. High-quality data increases value throughout the information supply chain, and the benefits extend to the client, employee, and shareholder. <em>Competing with High Quality Data: Concepts, Tools and Techniques for Building a Successful Approach to Data Quality</em> provides the information and guidance necessary to formulate and activate an effective data quality plan today.</p></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Advanced data management has always been at the core of efficient database and information systems. Recent trends like big data and cloud computing have aggravated the need for sophisticated and flexible data storage and processing solutions.<br/>This book provides a comprehensive coverage of the principles of data management developed in the last decades with a focus on data structures and query languages. It treats a wealth of different data models and surveys the foundations of structuring, processing, storing and querying data according these models.</p><p>Starting off with the topic of database design, it further discusses weaknesses of the relational data model, and then proceeds to convey the basics of graph data, tree-structured XML data, key-value pairs and nested, semi-structured JSON data, columnar and record-oriented data as well as object-oriented data. The final chapters round the book off with an analysis of fragmentation, replication and consistency strategies for data management in distributed databases as well as recommendations for handling polyglot persistence in multi-model databases and multi-database architectures.</p><p>While primarily geared towards students of Master-level courses in Computer Science and related areas, this book may also be of benefit to practitioners looking for a reference book on data modeling and query processing. It provides both theoretical depth and a concise treatment of open source technologies currently on the market.<br/></p></span>",

Manage information like a pro, to achieve much better financial results for the enterprise, more efficient processes, and multiple advantages over competitors.</p><p>As you’ll discover in <em>Enterprise Information Management in Practice</em>, EIM deals with both structured data (e.g. sales data and customer data) as well as unstructured data (like customer satisfaction forms, emails, documents, social network sentiments, and so forth). With the deluge of information that enterprises face given their global operations and complex business models, as well as the advent of big data technology, it is not surprising that making sense of the large piles of data is of paramount importance. Enterprises must therefore put much greater emphasis on managing and monetizing both structured and unstructured data.</p><p>As Saumya Chaki—an information management expert and consultant with IBM—explains in <em>Enterprise Information Management in Practice</em>, it is now more important than ever before to have an enterprise information strategy that covers the entire life cycle of information and its consumption while providing security controls. </p><p>With Fortune 100 consultant Saumya Chaki as your guide, <em>Enterprise Information Management in Practice </em>covers each of these and the other pillars of EIM in depth, which provide readers with a comprehensive view of the building blocks for EIM. </p><p>Enterprises today deal with complex business environments where information demands take place in real time, are complex, and often serve as the differentiator among competitors. The effective management of information is thus crucial in managing enterprises. Enterprise Information Management (EIM) has evolved as a specialized discipline in the business intelligence and enterprise data warehousing space to address the complex needs of information processing and delivery—and to ensure the enterprise is making the most of its information assets. </p></span></span>",

Unlike traditional databases, cloud data warehouses can address these challenges through their ability to handle both current and historical data and their suitability for ad hoc and exploratory analysis (as well as custom reporting). Join Joyce Avila to learn how to effectively use a cloud data warehouse to analyze data at scale.",

    "description": "<span><span><p>Data modeling is one of the most critical phases in the database\napplication development process, but also the phase most likely to\nfail. A master data modeler must come into any organization,\nunderstand its data requirements, and skillfully model the data for\napplications that most effectively serve organizational needs.</p><p><b><em>Mastering Data Modeling</em></b> is a complete guide to\nbecoming a successful data modeler. Featuring a requirements-driven\napproach, this book clearly explains fundamental concepts,\nintroduces a user-oriented data modeling notation, and describes a\nrigorous, step-by-step process for collecting, modeling, and\ndocumenting the kinds of data that users need.</p><p>Assuming no prior knowledge, <em><b>Mastering Data\nModeling</b></em> sets forth several fundamental problems of data\nmodeling, such as reconciling the software developer's demand for\nrigor with the users' equally valid need to speak their own\n(sometimes vague) natural language. In addition, it describes the\ngood habits that help you respond to these fundamental problems.\nWith these good habits in mind, the book describes the Logical Data\nStructure (LDS) notation and the process of controlled evolution by\nwhich you can create low-cost, user-approved data models that\nresist premature obsolescence. Also included is an encyclopedic\nanalysis of all data shapes that you will encounter. Most notably,\nthe book describes The Flow, a loosely scripted process by which\nyou and the users gradually but continuously improve an LDS until\nit faithfully represents the information needs. Essential\nimplementation and technology issues are also covered.</p><p>You will learn about such vital topics as:</p><li><p>The fundamental problems of data modeling</p></li><li><p>The good habits that help a data modeler be effective and\neconomical</p></li><li><p>LDS notation, which encourages these good habits</p></li><li><p>How to read an LDS aloud--in declarative English sentences</p></li><li><p>How to write a well-formed (syntactically correct) LDS</p></li><li><p>How to get users to name the parts of an LDS with words from\ntheir own business vocabulary</p></li><li><p>How to visualize data for an LDS</p></li><li><p>A catalog of LDS shapes that recur throughout all data\nmodels</p></li><li><p>The Flow--the template for your conversations with users</p></li><li><p>How to document an LDS for users, data modelers, and\ntechnologists</p></li><li><p>How to map an LDS to a relational schema</p></li><li><p>How LDS differs from other notations and why</p></li><p>\"Story interludes\" appear throughout the book, illustrating\nreal-world successes of the LDS notation and controlled evolution\nprocess. Numerous exercises help you master critical skills. In\naddition, two detailed, annotated sample conversations with users\nshow you the process of controlled evolution in action.</p></span></span>",

    "title": "Practical RDF",
    "description": "<span><span><p>The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a structure for describing and interchanging metadata on the Web--anything from library catalogs and worldwide directories to bioinformatics, Mozilla internal data structures, and knowledge bases for artificial intelligence projects. RDF provides a consistent framework and syntax for describing and querying data, making it possible to share website descriptions more easily. RDF's capabilities, however, have long been shrouded by its reputation for complexity and a difficult family of specifications. <i>Practical RDF</i> breaks through this reputation with immediate and solvable problems to help you understand, master, and implement RDF solutions.<i>Practical RDF</i> explains RDF from the ground up, providing real-world examples and descriptions of how the technology is being used in applications like Mozilla, FOAF, and Chandler, as well as infrastructure you can use to build your own applications. This book cuts to the heart of the W3C's often obscure specifications, giving you tools to apply RDF successfully in your own projects.The first part of the book focuses on the RDF specifications. After an introduction to RDF, the book covers the RDF specification documents themselves, including RDF Semantics and Concepts and Abstract Model specifications, RDF constructs, and the RDF Schema. The second section focuses on programming language support, and the tools and utilities that allow developers to review, edit, parse, store, and manipulate RDF/XML. Subsequent sections focus on RDF's data roots, programming and framework support, and practical implementation and use of RDF and RDF/XML.If you want to know how to apply RDF to information processing, <i>Practical RDF</i> is for you. Whether your interests lie in large-scale information aggregation and analysis or in smaller-scale projects like weblog syndication, this book will provide you with a solid foundation for working with RDF.</p></span></span>",

Whether you are a self-taught developer without a formal technical background or you have a degree in Computer Science, this book will provide with the knowledge you need to develop advanced data structures and algorithms in Swift using the latest language features.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Get to know about the basic data structures and how to use the Swift REPL</li><li>Use the Swift Standard Library collections bridging to Objective-C collections, and find out about protocol-oriented programming</li><li>Find out about Swift generators and sequences, and see how to use them to implement advanced data structures such as Stack, StackList, Queue, and LinkedList</li><li>Implement sorting algorithms such as Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort and understand the performance trade-offs between them</li><li>See how to implement various binary trees, B-Tree, and Splay Trees</li><li>Perform advanced searching methods using Red-Black trees, AVL trees, and Trie trees, and take a look at several substring search algorithms</li><li>Get to know about the data structures used in graphs and how to implement graphs such as depth-first search, breadth-first search, directed graphs, spanning tree, and shortest path</li><li>Explore algorithm efficiency and see how to measure it</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Apple's Swift language has expressive features that are familiar to those working with modern functional languages, but also provides backward support for Objective-C and Apple's legacy frameworks. These features are attracting many new developers to start creating applications for OS X and iOS using Swift. </p><p>Designing an application to scale while processing large amounts of data or provide fast and efficient searching can be complex, especially running on mobile devices with limited memory and bandwidth. Learning about best practices and knowing how to select the best data structure and algorithm in Swift is crucial to the success of your application and will help ensure your application is a success. That's what this book will teach you.</p><p>Starting at the beginning, this book will cover the basic data structures and Swift types, and introduce asymptotic analysis. You'll learn about the standard library collections and bridging between Swift and Objective-C collections. You will see how to implement advanced data structures, sort algorithms, work with trees, advanced searching methods, use graphs, and performance and algorithm efficiency. You'll also see how to choose the perfect algorithm for your problem.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This easy-to-follow yet comprehensive guide can either be read from beginning to end, or depending on your current knowledge level, you can jump to the specific chapter that interests you. Each chapter topic starts with an introduction to the topic and algorithm before moving on to the hands-on implementation and analysis.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>A key task that any aspiring data-driven organization needs to learn is data wrangling, the process of converting raw data into something truly useful. This practical guide provides business analysts with an overview of various data wrangling techniques and tools, and puts the practice of data wrangling into context by asking, \"What are you trying to do and why?\"</p><p>Wrangling data consumes roughly 50-80% of an analyst’s time before any kind of analysis is possible. Written by key executives at Trifacta, this book walks you through the wrangling process by exploring several factors—time, granularity, scope, and structure—that you need to consider as you begin to work with data. You’ll learn a shared language and a comprehensive understanding of data wrangling, with an emphasis on recent agile analytic processes used by many of today’s data-driven organizations.</p><p>Appreciate the importance—and the satisfaction—of wrangling data the right way.</p><ul><li>Understand what kind of data is available</li><li>Choose which data to use and at what level of detail</li><li>Meaningfully combine multiple sources of data</li><li>Decide how to distill the results to a size and shape that can drive downstream analysis</li></ul></div></span></span>",

Authors Federico Castanedo and Scott Gidley dive into the specifics of analyzing metadata for keeping track of your data—where it comes from, where it’s located, and how it’s being used—so you can provide safeguards and reduce risk. In the process, you’ll learn about methods for automating metadata capture.</p><p>This report also explains the main features of a data lake architecture, and discusses the pros and cons of several data lake management solutions that support metadata.

    "title": "Practical Financial Optimization: A Library of GAMS Models",
    "description": "<span><span><span><p>In <em>Practical Financial Optimization: A Library of GAMS Models</em>, the authors provide a diverse set of models for portfolio optimization, based on the General Algebraic Modelling System. 'GAMS' consists of a language which allows a high-level, algebraic representation of mathematical models and a set of solvers – numerical algorithms – to solve them. The system was developed in response to the need for powerful and flexible front-end tools to manage large, real-life models.</p><p>The work begins with an overview of the structure of the GAMS language, and discusses issues relating to the management of data in GAMS models. The authors provide models for mean-variance portfolio optimization which address the question of trading off the portfolio expected return against its risk. Fixed income portfolio optimization models perform standard calculations and allow the user to bootstrap a yield curve from bond prices. Dedication models allow for standard portfolio dedication with borrowing and re-investment decisions, and are extended to deal with maximisation of horizon return and to incorporate various practical considerations on the portfolio tradeability. Immunization models provide for the factor immunization of portfolios of treasury and corporate bonds.</p><p>The scenario-based portfolio optimization problem is addressed with mean absolute deviation models, tracking models, regret models, conditional VaR models, expected utility maximization models and put/call efficient frontier models. The authors employ stochastic programming for dynamic portfolio optimization, developing stochastic dedication models as stochastic extensions of the fixed income models discussed in chapter 4. Two-stage and multi-stage stochastic programs extend the scenario models analysed in Chapter 5 to allow dynamic rebalancing of portfolios as time evolves and new information becomes known. Models for structuring index funds and hedging interest rate risk on international portfolios are also provided.</p><p>The final chapter provides a set of 'case studies': models for large-scale applications of portfolio optimization, which can be used as the basis for the development of business support systems to suit any special requirements, including models for the management of participating insurance policies and personal asset allocation.</p><p>The title will be a valuable guide for quantitative developers and analysts, portfolio and asset managers, investment strategists and advanced students of finance.</p></span></span></span>",

Three world-renowned leaders\nin object development have pared object modeling down to the core\nconcepts for all business domains, business rules, and business\nservices. Starting from the first principles of \"object think,\" the\nauthors offer a fully integrated approach to building, validating,\nand critiquing object models. Coverage includes:</p><li><p>Proven principles and techniques for successfully modeling the\nstructure and operations of any business domain.</p></li><li><p>Guidelines for finding and associating objects, assembling\nobject models, and distributing system behavior among objects.</p></li><li><p>Rigorous methods for discovering, organizing, and implementing\nbusiness rules around objects.</p></li><li><p>Twelve all-encompassing \"collaboration patterns\"–what\nthey represent, how they relate, and how to apply them.</p></li><li><p>Five kinds of business rules, three types of services, and six\ncategories of properties completely specify object-oriented\nbusiness requirements</p></li><p>From start to finish, the book makes\nextensive use of examples drawn from real commercial applications.\nTo illustrate how streamlined object modeling flows from analysis\nto code, it also presents a complete case study derived from a\nreal-world application, and implemented in two leading\nobject-oriented languages-Java, and the Squeak implementation of\nSmalltalk.</p></span></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Create good data from the start, rather than fixing it after it is collected. By following the guidelines in this book, you will be able to conduct more effective analyses and produce timely presentations of research data.</p><p>Data analysts are often presented with datasets for exploration and study that are poorly designed, leading to difficulties in interpretation and to delays in producing meaningful results.  Much data analytics training focuses on how to clean and transform datasets before serious analyses can even be started. Inappropriate or confusing representations, unit of measurement choices, coding errors, missing values, outliers, etc., can be avoided by using good dataset design and by understanding how data types determine the kinds of analyses which can be performed.<br/></p><p>This book discusses the principles and best practices of dataset creation, and covers basic data types and their related appropriate statistics and visualizations. A key focus of the book is why certain data types are chosen for representing concepts and measurements, in contrast to the typical discussions of how to analyze a specific data type once it has been selected.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><p></p><ul><li>Be aware of the principles of creating and collecting data</li><li>Know the basic data types and representations</li><li>Select data types, anticipating analysis goals</li><li>Understand dataset structures and practices for analyzing and sharing</li><li>Be guided by examples and use cases (good and bad)</li><li>Use cleaning tools and methods to create good data</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>Researchers who design studies and collect data and subsequently conduct and report the results of their analyses can use the best practices in this book to produce better descriptions and interpretations of their work.

It has become an empire.\"<br/>Garrison traces the roots of the American empire to the very beginnings of the republic, in particular to the historic willingness of United States' to use military might in the defense of two consistent --- if sometimes contradictory --- foreign policy objectives: protection of American commercial interests and promotion of democracy.<br/>How long can the American empire last? Garrison looks at American history within the context of the rise and fall of empires and argues that the U. S. can gain important insights into durability from the Romans. He details the interplay between military power, political institutions, and legal structures that enabled the Roman empire at it's apogee to last for longer than America has as a country.<br/>But the real question is, what kind of empire can and should America be? As the sole superpower, America must lead in shaping a new global order, just as after World War II Roosevelt and Truman took the lead in shaping a new international order. That international order is now crumbling under the pressures of globalization, persistent poverty, terrorism and fundamentalism. Garrison outlines the kinds of cooperative global structures America must promote if its empire is to leave a lasting legacy of greatness. Garrison calls for Americans to consciously see themselves as a transitional empire, one whose task is not to dominate but to catalyze the next generation of global governance mechanisms that would make obsolete the need for empire. If this is done, America could be the final empire.\n  </span>",

You will see the typical data science steps and techniques utilized by data professionals. Next, you will build a simple chatbot so you can get a clear sense of what is involved.</p><p>The next part is an introduction to data science in Python. You will have an opportunity to master Python for data science as each section is followed by an assignment to practice your skills. By the end of the section, you will understand Python fundamentals, decision and looping structures, Python functions, how to work with nested data, and list comprehension. Finally, we will wrap up the two most popular libraries for data science—NumPy and Pandas.</p><p>The last part delves into essential math for data science. You will get the hang of linear algebra along with probability and statistics. Our goal for the linear algebra part is to introduce all necessary concepts and intuition for an in-depth understanding of an often-utilized technique for data fitting called least squares. We will spend a lot of time on probability, both classical and Bayesian, as reasoning about problems is a much more difficult aspect than simply running statistics.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will understand data science methodology and how to use essential math in your real projects.</p><p><b>Audience</b></p><p>This course is designed for people who are new to data science or who are interested in pursuing a career in data science, as well as those who wish to obtain a broad overview before diving into specialized data science topics.</p><p>This course will also benefit students who want to master the fundamental arithmetic for data science or obtain an introduction to data science in Python.</p><p>You need not have any prior experience in data science to take up this course.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span>Get up to speed on the application of machine learning approaches in macroeconomic research. This book brings together economics and data science.<div><br/></div><div>Author Tshepo Chris Nokeri begins by introducing you to covariance analysis, correlation analysis, cross-validation, hyperparameter optimization, regression analysis, and residual analysis. In addition, he presents an approach to contend with multi-collinearity. He then debunks a time series model recognized as the additive model. He reveals a technique for binarizing an economic feature to perform classification analysis using logistic regression. He brings in the Hidden Markov Model, used to discover hidden patterns and growth in the world economy. The author demonstrates unsupervised machine learning techniques such as principal component analysis and cluster analysis. Key deep learning concepts and ways of structuring artificial neural networks are explored along with training them and assessing their performance. The Monte Carlo simulation technique is applied to stimulate the purchasing power of money in an economy. Lastly, the Structural Equation Model (SEM) is considered to integrate correlation analysis, factor analysis, multivariate analysis, causal analysis, and path analysis.<div><br/></div><div>After reading this book, you should be able to recognize the connection between econometrics and data science. You will know how to apply a machine learning approach to modeling complex economic problems and others  beyond this book. You will know how to circumvent and enhance model performance, together with the practical implications of a machine learning approach in  econometrics, and you will be able to deal with pressing economic problems.<br/></div> <div><br/></div><div><br/></div></div><div><b>What You Will Learn</b></div><div><ul><li>Examine complex, multivariate, linear-causal structures through  the path and structural analysis technique, including non-linearity and hidden  states</li><li>Be familiar with practical applications of machine learning and deep learning in econometrics</li><li>Understand theoretical  framework and hypothesis development, and techniques for selecting appropriate  models</li><li>Develop,  test, validate, and improve key supervised (i.e., regression and  classification) and unsupervised (i.e., dimension reduction and cluster  analysis) machine learning models, alongside neural networks, Markov, and SEM  models</li><li>Represent and interpret data and models</li></ul></div><div><p> </p></div><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>Beginning and intermediate data scientists, economists, machine learning engineers, statisticians, and business executives<br/></div><div><br/></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>Though we have in the past depended on traditional data warehouses to drive business intelligence from data, they were generally based on databases and structured data formats and proved insufficient for the challenges that the current data-driven world faces. Enter data lakes, which are optimized for unstructured and semistructured data, can scale to petabytes easily, and allow better integration of a wide range of tools to help businesses get the most out of their data. Data and software professionals are now moving toward a disaggregated architecture, which makes each layer much more independent and allows them to use the perfect tool for each job.</p><p>California State University took a different approach by residing most of their logic within a programming framework that allowed them to build a testable platform. By applying DataOps techniques, they were able to create reusable, scalable, and extensible data architectures.</p><p>Recorded on November 2, 2021.

    "description": "<span><div><p>The information technology revolutions over the past six decades have been astonishing, from mainframes to personal computers to smart and connected economies. But those changes pale in comparison to what’s about to happen. By 2020, seven billion people and roughly 50 billion devices will be connected to the internet, leaving the world awash in data. How do we make sense of it all?</p><p>In this insightful book, Raghunath Nambiar from Cisco examines the role of analytics in enabling digital transformation within the enterprise, including challenges associated with the explosion of data. It embraces the need for analytics at the edge of the network with a local context and analytics at the data center core with a global context. He also explores the differences between the four types of analytics—descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive—including the driving factors behind the need for each of them, as well as the analytical systems required to process them to produce actionable insight.</p><p>Raghu then takes a deep dive into how the explosion in internet connections affects key industries, and how applied analytics will impact our future. Learn how analytics can make a difference in:</p><ul><li><b>Smart cities</b> to manage energy, the environment, traffic, parking, structures, waste, safety, and crowds</li><li><b>Smart energy</b> to enable sustainable and efficient offerings that provide substantial benefits for both providers and customers</li><li><b>Healthcare</b> to address the aging population, growing shortage of physicians,  and rising costs through connected health</li><li><b>Manufacturing</b> for producing higher quality products, creating new lines of business, reducing time-to-market, and increasing revenue growth</li><li><b>Transportation</b> to address the increasing demand through collaborative consumption, connected cars, and the potential for autonomous vehicles</li></ul></div></span>",

Languages such as R, Python, Java, and so on are mostly used for data science. It is particularly good at analyzing large sets of data without any significant impact on performance and thus Scala is being adopted by many developers and data scientists. Data scientists might be aware that building applications that are truly scalable is hard. Scala, with its powerful functional libraries for interacting with databases and building scalable frameworks will give you the tools to construct robust data pipelines.</p><p>This book will introduce you to the libraries for ingesting, storing, manipulating, processing, and visualizing data in Scala.</p><p>Packed with real-world examples and interesting data sets, this book will teach you to ingest data from flat files and web APIs and store it in a SQL or NoSQL database. It will show you how to design scalable architectures to process and modelling your data, starting from simple concurrency constructs such as parallel collections and futures, through to actor systems and Apache Spark. As well as Scala's emphasis on functional structures and immutability, you will learn how to use the right parallel construct for the job at hand, minimizing development time without compromising scalability. Finally, you will learn how to build beautiful interactive visualizations using web frameworks.</p><p>This book gives tutorials on some of the most common Scala libraries for data science, allowing you to quickly get up to speed with building data science and data engineering solutions.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>A tutorial with complete examples, this book will give you the tools to start building useful data engineering and data science solutions straightaway</p></span>",

This session provides an overview of the latest improvements in deep learning across various research labs since the initial inception.</p><p><b>On the Computational and Statistical Interface and \"Big Data\"</b><br/><i>Michael Jordan, Professor, UC Berkeley</i><br/>How does statistical decision theory provide a mathematical point of departure for achieving such a blending? In this session, you’ll learn theoretical tradeoffs between statistical risk, amount of data, and “externalities” such as computation, communication, and privacy.</p><p><b>Interpretable Machine Learning in Practice</b><br/><i>Maya Gupta, Research and Development Manager, Google</i><br/>What makes a large machine learning system more interpretable and robust in practice? This session discusses the importance of monotonicity, smoothness, semantically meaningful inputs and outputs, and designing algorithms that are easy to debug.</p><p><b>Visual Understanding Beyond Naming</b><br/><i>Alyosha Efros, Associate Professor, UC Berkeley</i><br/>This session describes some of the efforts to bypass the “language bottleneck” and other information to help in visual understanding and visual data mining.</p><p><b>Finding Repeated Structure in Time Series Data: Commercial and Scientific Opportunities</b><br/><i>Eamonn Keogh, Professor, University of California - Riverside</i><br/>In this session, Eamonn argues that, relative to other types of data (text, social networks, etc.), time series data is relatively underexploited, and that many opportunities are available for novel commercial applications and scientific discoveries.</p><p><b>Tensor Methods for Large-scale Unsupervised Learning: Applications to Topic and Community Modeling</b><br/><i>Anima Anandkumar, Faculty member, UC Irvine</i><br/>Understand how to exploit tensor methods for learning. Tensors are higher order generalizations of matrices, and are useful for representing rich information structures. Tensor factorization involves finding a compact representation of the tensor using simple linear and multilinear algebra.</p><p><b>High Performance Machine Learning through Codesign and Rooflining</b><br/><i>John Canny, Professor, UC Berkeley</i><br/>How fast can machine learning (ML) and graph algorithms be? BIDMach is a toolkit for machine learning that uses rooflined design and GPUs to achieve one-to-three orders of magnitude improvements over other toolkits on single machines—larger than have been reported for cluster systems running on hundreds of nodes for common ML tasks.</p><p><b>A Quest for Visual Intelligence in Computers</b><br/><i>Fei-Fei Li (Stanford University)</i><br/>Look into computer vision technology, including ongoing projects in large-scale object recognition and visual scene story telling from Stanford Vision Lab.</p><p><b>Graph mining for log data</b><br/><i>David Andrzejewski, Lead Data Sciences Engineer, Sumo Logic</i><br/>Many of the millions of events logged inside a given software system are not isolated occurrences, but rather links in richly interconnected causal chains. This session reveals how graph-mining techniques can surface high-value insights from the relationships between logged events.</p><p><b>Why Julia is Important for Data Science</b><br/><i>John Myles White, Data Scientist, Facebook</i><br/>In this session, you’ll learn the ways in which Julia improves upon the current generation of languages used for data science.</p><p><b>Drugs, DNA, and Dinosaurs: Building High Quality Knowledge Bases with DeepDive</b><br/><i>Chris Re, Assistant Professor, Stanford University</i><br/>Learn how DeepDive is used in a range of tasks from diagnosing rare diseases to drug purposing to filling out the tree of life. DeepDive helps to create knowledge bases that meet—and sometimes exceed—human-level quality and to perform predictive analytics on top of this data.</p></div></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Market Basket Analysis (MBA) provides the ability to continually monitor the affinities of a business and can help an organization achieve a key competitive advantage. Time Variant data enables data warehouses to directly associate events in the past with the participants in each individual event. In the past however, the use of these powerful tools in tandem led to performance degradation and resulted in unactionable and even damaging information. Data Warehouse Designs: Achieving ROI with Market Basket Analysis and Time Variance presents an innovative, soup-to-nuts approach that successfully combines what was previously incompatible, without degradation, and uses the relational architecture already in place. Built around two main chapters, Market Basket Solution Definition and Time Variant Solution Definition, it provides a tangible how-to design that can be used to facilitate MBA within the context of a data warehouse. Presents a solution for creating home-grown MBA data marts Includes database design solutions in the context of Oracle, DB2, SQL Server, and Teradata relational database management systems (RDBMS) Explains how to extract, transform, and load data used in MBA and Time Variant solutions The book uses standard RDBMS platforms, proven database structures, standard SQL and hardware, and software and practices already accepted and used in the data warehousing community to fill the gaps left by most conceptual discussions of MBA. It employs a form and language intended for a data warehousing audience to explain the practicality of how data is delivered, stored, and viewed. Offering a comprehensive explanation of the applications that provide, store, and use MBA data, Data Warehouse Designs provides you with the language and concepts needed to require and receive information that is relevant and actionable.</p></span>",

I also enjoyed the author’s style and his technical expertise shone through,\" Christopher Wright, Wright CandA Consulting Ltd.<p/>\n\n<p/>Protecting critical information infrastructure (CII) is not an easy process. Risks need to be minimised and systems adequately protected. It is an endless balancing act, where one side is constantly on the defensive and the other on the offensive. Lessons Learned: Critical Information Infrastructure Protection aims to help you be as successful as possible in protecting your CII, and do so quickly with minimum effort, irrespective of whether you work for a critical infrastructure service provider, a company that organises the provision of critical infrastructure services, or a company that serves critical service providers.\n\n<p/> Drawing on more than 20 years of experience in the IT and cyber security sectors, the author defines critical infrastructure services and provides structured lessons for each chapter, summarising each with key takeaways, including how to:<p/>\n<ul><li>Describe the critical infrastructure service and determine its service level;</li><li>Identify and analyse the interconnections and dependencies of information systems;</li><li>Create a functioning organisation to protect CII; and</li><li>Train people to make sure they are aware of cyber threats and know the correct behaviour.</li><li>The key message – organisations must be prepared to provide critical infrastructure services without IT systems – is reinforced in the final chapter: “We must have some way of continuing to work even if computers fail”, writes Mikko Hypponen. </li></ul>\n<p/> <b>Understand how you can protect your organisation's critical information infrastructure. <b/></b>\n  </span>",

It focuses on similarity search queries, showing how to use distance functions to measure the notion of dissimilarity.</p><p/><p>After defining database queries and similarity search queries, the book organizes the most common and representative index structures according to their characteristics. The author first describes low-dimensional index structures, memory-based index structures, and hierarchical disk-based index structures. He then outlines useful distance measures and index structures that use the distance information to efficiently solve similarity search queries. Focusing on the difficult dimensionality phenomenon, he also presents several indexing methods that specifically deal with high-dimensional spaces. In addition, the book covers data reduction techniques, including embedding, various data transforms, and histograms.</p><p/><p>Through numerous real-world examples, this book explores how to effectively index and search for information in large collections of data. Requiring only a basic computer science background, it is accessible to practitioners and advanced undergraduate students.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "At first glance, deploying data in a data lake may seem like a one-step process: you simply add the dataset to the production location in the object store. What else is there to do? It turns out that there is more you should do, and blindly writing new data introduces a host of potential problems. For example, how do you know the data you write is accurate and conforms to best practices such as format and schema? The truth is, once you’ve written data to the production location of your lake, consumers can use it. In a sense, it’s already too late. Einat Orr presents a new strategy for data deployment, one where new data can be added in isolation, then tested and validated, before “going live” in a production table. She'll also demonstrate how data versioning tools like lakeFS and Project Nessie can support this deployment method in a seamless way with zero copy operations.",

    "description": "<span><p>Quality public education, modern highway systems, and reasonably priced housing—these are just some of the qualities that once made California one of the most desirable places to live. Just a few decades later, the state finds itself with an education system that is failing its citizens, one of the highest unemployment rates in the nation, and a quickly evaporating dream of home ownership. </p><p>Illustrating each step of the breakdown that led to its current state of dysfunction, <strong>Not So Golden After All: The Rise and Fall of California</strong> provides insight into a system gone amuck. It addresses complicated topics in an engaging manner to help the public and leaders alike understand how to make policies that balance expectations with outcomes. Key political themes covered include disconnected institutions, perpetually unbalanced budgets, immigration, voter ignorance, interest group influence, and dysfunctional institutions. Investigating the gridlock that has become all too common within the state’s legislature, the book:</p><ul><p>\n</p><li>Demonstrates the impact of the state’s inability to generate sufficient revenue, particularly for public education and an under-trained workforce</li><li>Highlights the problems created by poor land use planning —from suburban sprawl and government waste to inefficient use of agricultural land</li><li>Examines how interest groups have been able to wrest control of the processes that were created to keep them in line</li><li>Identifies the duplication of efforts and other inefficiencies at the state and local levels</li><p/></ul><p>Author Larry Gerston leaves no stone unturned in his discussion of California's economy, position on the Pacific Rim, cultural diversity, land and water issues, and its relationship with the federal government. He examines the state’s infrastructure, natural resources, immigration issues, education, finance, healthcare, civil rights, planning and development, security, laws, political parties, and power structures to provide civic leaders and policy makers with the understanding required to restore the sheen to this once glistening paradise.</p>The Contra Costa Times discussed Larry Gerston's recent Commonwealth Club lecture in a May 17, 2012 article.\n\nRead an interview with Larry Gerston in The Mercury News.\n\n  </span>",

    "description": "<span><p>With healthcare making the transition from volume-based reimbursement programs to value-based approaches, understanding performance measurement is vital to optimize payment and quality outcomes. <strong>Performance-Based Medicine: Creating the High Performance Network to Optimize Managed Care Relationships</strong> guides readers through the maze of definitions and discussions related to value-based purchasing, healthcare delivery, and pricing. It tackles the question of how hospitals, HMOs, physician groups, and employers can arrive at an optimized reimbursement cost and coverage access decision that is attractive to consumers yet fulfills the need for a working margin.</p><p/><p>The book begins by looking at HMOs and the three key factors—reimbursement, coordination, and performance—that have led toward performance-based contracting. Laying the foundation for clearer communication between physician hospitals and purchasers, the author defines important concepts in the discussion, from efficiency and cost effectiveness to quality. He focuses on key issues of organizational structure, management, and measuring the outcomes of quality.</p><p/><p>Discussing pay-for-performance, the book examines programs in the US and offers case studies of countries succeeding in the development of care management. It explores options for reengineering the healthcare delivery system, among them transitional case management programs and specialist data sharing. It also covers the use of information technology in healthcare delivery.</p><p/><p>This timely book will be of interest to managers, vendors, employers, and insurers who have tried everything to lower cost but are discovering that all care is not equal and that matching the right doctor with the right service for the right patient can be done. Helping readers build a path between where they are and where they want to be, it offers an outline of tasks to move from a disorganized collection of care components to a seamless arrangement of high-performance care-givers.</p><p/><p>The book is directed at the senior management level for those who are learning metrics and are trying to define performance to become more sophisticated in monitoring and leveraging this vital data in a complex marketplace of contradictory terms and ill-defined outcomes.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>In a business world of uncertain budgets, relentless technology changes, scarce management talent, and intense production demands, theory is good, but practice sells. The Effective CIO: How to Achieve Outstanding Success through Strategic Alignment, Financial Management, and IT Governance is all about practice, successfully delivering the nuts-and-bolts for effective governance execution. It helps to dissolve the negative image many CIOs have as remote, purely rational decision machines, while demonstrating how to improve quality and throughput in your business.</p><p>This authoritative text includes governance checklists, sample IT controls, merger and acquisition recommendations, and a detailed framework for IT policies. Authored by two highly regarded IT management experts, the book provides not only a survey of existing strategies, but also includes detailed problem-solving ideas, such as how to structure optimal IT and telecom contracts with suppliers, the implications of SOP-98, and accounting for software costs. </p><p>The book seamlessly brings together two perspectives - that of a working CIO who must cope with day-to-day pressures for results, and that of an IT audit consultant with a special focus on governance and internal control. Unlike many other CIO-related books that merely discuss strategies, The Effective CIO includes easy-to-follow guidelines and governance principles that can be implemented immediately.</p></span>",

    "description": "Data science is still fundamentally “curiosity driven.” In today's world, what sets apart a good data scientist is the number of insights they can generate in a given unit of time. The one inelastic quantity in all of this is the data scientist’s time. A curious data scientist ideally needs to be able to ask as many questions and identify as many useful insights within their day as possible. So what's preventing them? Unfortunately most of their time is spent preparing to ask questions (assembling tools, data, etc.). Data science needs to focus on the experimentation loop: going from question to an answer and the next question as quickly as possible. In order to do this, the entire workflow (not just the user-facing part) must be brought to the data scientist. This means empowering them with a fully integrated set of tools and the necessary supporting infrastructure at an individual level. The big need to support productivity at scale is to be able to raise the bar on performance at scale for analytic infrastructure. Join Venkat Krishnamurthy and Alex Baden to learn how Intel AI and OmniSci are working together to give data scientists access to incredible, open tools, a variety of techniques—and no shortages.",

    "description": "<span><p>The WWW era made billions of people dramatically dependent on the progress of data technologies, out of which Internet search and Big Data are arguably the most notable. Structured Search paradigm connects them via a fundamental concept of key-objects evolving out of keywords as the units of search. The key-object data model and KeySQL revamp the data independence principle making it applicable for Big Data and complement NoSQL with full-blown structured querying functionality. The ultimate goal is extracting Big Information from the Big Data.</p><p>As a Big Data Consultant, Mikhail Gilula combines academic background with 20 years of industry experience in the database and data warehousing technologies working as a Sr. Data Architect for Teradata, Alcatel-Lucent, and PayPal, among others. He has authored three books, including <i>The Set Model for Database and Information Systems</i> and holds four US Patents in Structured Search and Data Integration.</p><ul><li>Conceptualizes structured search as a technology for querying multiple data sources in an independent and scalable manner.</li><li>Explains how NoSQL and KeySQL complement each other and serve different needs with respect to big data</li><li>Shows the place of structured search in the internet evolution and describes its implementations including the real-time structured internet search</li></ul></span>",

This book teaches you to use Python scripts to crawl through websites at scale and scrape data from HTML and JavaScript-enabled pages and convert it into structured data formats such as CSV, Excel, JSON, or load it into a SQL database of your choice. </p><p>This book goes beyond the basics of web scraping and covers advanced topics such as natural language processing (NLP) and text analytics to extract names of people, places, email addresses, contact details, etc., from a page at production scale using distributed big data techniques on an Amazon Web Services (AWS)-based cloud infrastructure. It book covers developing a robust data processing and ingestion pipeline on the Common Crawl corpus, containing petabytes of data publicly available and a web crawl data set available on AWS's registry of open data.<br/></p><div><b><i>Getting Structured Data from the Internet</i></b> also includes a step-by-step tutorial on deploying your own crawlers using a production web scraping framework (such as Scrapy) and dealing with real-world issues (such as breaking Captcha, proxy IP rotation, and more). Code used in the book is provided to help you understand the concepts in practice and write your own web crawler to power your business ideas.<br/></div><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><p></p><ul><li>Understand web scraping, its applications/uses, and how to avoid web scraping by hitting publicly available rest API endpoints to directly get data</li><li>Develop a web scraper and crawler from scratch using lxml and BeautifulSoup library, and learn about scraping from JavaScript-enabled pages using Selenium</li><li>Use AWS-based cloud computing with EC2, S3, Athena, SQS, and SNS to analyze, extract, and store useful insights from crawled pages</li><li>Use SQL language on PostgreSQL running on Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) and SQLite using SQLalchemy</li><li>Review sci-kit learn, Gensim, and spaCy to perform NLP tasks on scraped web pages such as name entity recognition, topic clustering (Kmeans, Agglomerative Clustering), topic modeling (LDA, NMF, LSI), topic classification (naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting Classifier) and text similarity (cosine distance-based nearest neighbors)</li><li>Handle web archival file formats and explore Common Crawl open data on AWS</li><li>Illustrate practical applications for web crawl data by building a similar website tool and a technology profiler similar to builtwith.com</li><li>Write scripts to create a backlinks database on a web scale similar to Ahrefs.com, Moz.com, Majestic.com, etc., for search engine optimization (SEO), competitor research, and determining website domain authority and ranking</li><li>Use web crawl data to build a news sentiment analysis system or alternative financial analysis covering stock market trading signals</li><li>Write a production-ready crawler in Python using Scrapy framework and deal with practical workarounds for Captchas, IP rotation, and more</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p>Primary audience: data analysts and scientists with little to no exposure to real-world data processing challenges, secondary: experienced software developers doing web-heavy data processing who need a primer, tertiary: business owners and startup founders who need to know more about implementation to better direct their technical team<p></p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><b>Jump-start your career as a data scientist—l</b><b>earn to develop datasets for exploration, analysis, and machine learning</b></p><p><i>SQL for Data Scientists:</i><i>A Beginner's Guide for Building Datasets for Analysis</i> is a resource that’s dedicated to the Structured Query Language (SQL) and dataset design skills that data scientists use most. Aspiring data scientists will learn how to how to construct datasets for exploration, analysis, and machine learning. You can also discover how to approach query design and develop SQL code to extract data insights while avoiding common pitfalls.</p><p>You may be one of many people who are entering the field of Data Science from a range of professions and educational backgrounds, such as business analytics, social science, physics, economics, and computer science. Like many of them, you may have conducted analyses using spreadsheets as data sources, but never retrieved and engineered datasets from a relational database using SQL, which is a programming language designed for managing databases and extracting data.</p><p>This guide for data scientists differs from other instructional guides on the subject. It doesn’t cover SQL broadly. Instead, you’ll learn the subset of SQL skills that data analysts and data scientists use frequently. You’ll also gain practical advice and direction on \"how to think about constructing your dataset.\"</p><ul><li>Gain an understanding of relational database structure, query design, and SQL syntax</li><li>Develop queries to construct datasets for use in applications like interactive reports and machine learning algorithms</li><li>Review strategies and approaches so you can design analytical datasets</li><li>Practice your techniques with the provided database and SQL code</li></ul><p>In this book, author Renee Teate shares knowledge gained during a 15-year career working with data, in roles ranging from database developer to data analyst to data scientist. She guides you through SQL code and dataset design concepts from an industry practitioner’s perspective, moving your data scientist career forward!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p/><p>\"I am sure practitioners, auditors, and regulators will find the content of Mr Shaik's book of value. The accessible style is also welcome. All in all, a worthwhile addition to the finance literature and one that hopefully helps plug the knowledge gap in this field.\" — from the foreword by Professor Moorad Choudhry, Brunel University</p><p><em>Managing Derivatives Contracts</em> is a comprehensive and practical treatment of the end-to-end management of the derivatives contract operations, systems, and platforms that support the trading and business of derivative products. This book focuses on the processes and systems in the derivatives contract life cycle that underlie and implement the activities of derivatives trading, pricing, and risk management.</p><p>Khader Shaik, a Wall Street derivatives platform implementation expert, lays out all the fundamentals needed to understand, conduct, and manage derivatives operations. In particular, he provides both introductory and in-depth treatment of the following topics: derivative product classes; the market structure, mechanics, and players of derivatives markets; types of derivative contracts and life cycle management; derivatives technology platforms, software systems, and protocols; derivatives contracts management; and the new regulatory landscape as shaped by reforms such as Dodd-Frank Title VII and EMIR. <em>Managing Derivatives Contracts</em> focuses on the operational processes and market environment of the derivatives life cycle; it does not address the mathematics or finance of derivatives trading, which are abundantly treated in the standard literature.</p><p><em>Managing Derivatives Contracts</em> is divided into four parts. The first part provides a structural overview of the derivatives markets and product classes. The second part examines the roles of derivatives market players, the organization of buy-side and sell-side firms, critical data elements, and the Dodd-Frank reforms. Within the framework of total market flow and straight-through processing as constrained by regulatory compliance, the core of the book details the contract life cycle from origination to expiration for each of the major derivatives product classes, including listed futures and options, cleared and bilateral OTC swaps, and credit derivatives. The final part of the book explores the underlying information technology platform, software systems, and protocols that drive the end-to-end business of derivatives. In particular, it supplies actionable guidelines on how to build a platform using vendor products, in-house development, or a hybrid approach.</p></span></span>",

Add to that\nthe issue of ever-changing user requirements and the vagaries of\nsoftware project management and \"quality\" can easily become a mere\nword on a distant horizon. This highly acclaimed book demonstrates\nhow the Unified Modeling Language (UML) can be used within a\nprocess framework to help reduce complexity, clarify requirements,\nand add structure to project management in order to yield software\nquality here and now.</p><p><b>Process Quality Assurance for UML-Based Projects</b> focuses\non the crucial process aspect of software quality. In an easy,\nentertaining way, the author outlines common-sense strategies for\ndetermining the applicability of UML to a project, creating and\nmanaging project teams, identifying levels of quality standards,\napplying quality techniques, and estimating and testing in\nUML-based projects.</p><p>With this book you will be able to:</p><li><p>Understand the elusive nature of software quality, the\npressures on software quality, and the importance of processes and\nmodeling in enhancing software quality</p></li><li><p>Divide modeling into three distinct but related\nspaces--problem, solution, and background space--and correlate the\nroles of business analyst, system designer, and system architect to\nthese modeling spaces respectively</p></li><li><p>Understand quality discussions applicable to small, medium, and\nlarge projects</p></li><li><p>Appreciate the sociological aspect of quality management in\nsoftware projects, including the value of transactional analysis\n(TA) in team formation and motivation</p></li><li><p>Relate to an iterative and incremental process based on the\nconcepts of process-components and related activities, tasks,\nroles, and deliverables</p></li><li><p>Move your organization forward in terms of CMM process\nmaturity</p></li><li><p>Gain valuable and practical insights into process and project\nmetrics, measurements, and estimations</p></li><li><p>Appreciate the strategic aspect of testing as it relates to\nquality assurance</p></li><li><p>Understand quality discussions applicable to new developments,\nintegration, package implementation, outsourcing, data warehousing,\nand educational projects</p></li><li><p>Access extremely well-referenced work by leading practitioners,\nresearchers, and academicians</p></li><li><p>Estimate and refine process and project metrics</p></li><p>At the end of each chapter, key points are encapsulated in FAQs\nand exercises for easy referencing and team training.</p><p><br/><br/>\n0201758210B08132002</p></span></span></span>",

These operators allow domain expert users to specify ML models via noisy operators over training data, leading to applications that can be built in hours or days rather than months or years. Alex explores recent work on modeling the noise and imprecision inherent in these operators and using these approaches to train ML models that solve real-world problems, including a recent state-of-the-art result on the SuperGLUE natural language processing benchmark task.\n            </p><p><b>Prerequisite knowledge</b></p><ul><li>A basic understanding of machine learning</li></ul><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><ul><li>\n                    Discover learning techniques for building, managing, and iterating on training datasets and modeling pipelines for ML in general and using the Snorkel framework\n                </li></ul><p>\n                This session is from the 2019 O'Reilly Artificial Intelligence Conference in San Jose, CA.\n            </p></div></span></span>",

    "title": "Understand, Manage, and Prevent Algorithmic Bias: A Guide for Business Users and Data Scientists",
    "description": "<span><p>Are algorithms friend or foe?</p><p>The human mind is evolutionarily designed to take shortcuts in order to survive. We jump to conclusions because our brains want to keep us safe. A majority of our biases work in our favor, such as when we feel a car speeding in our direction is dangerous and we instantly move, or when we decide not take a bite of food that appears to have gone bad. However, inherent bias negatively affects work environments and the decision-making surrounding our communities. While the creation of algorithms and machine learning attempts to eliminate bias, they are, after all, created by human beings, and thus are susceptible to what we call <i>algorithmic bias</i>.</p><p>In <i><b>Understand, Manage, and Prevent Algorithmic Bias</b></i>, author Tobias Baer helps you understand where algorithmic bias comes from, how to manage it as a business user or regulator, and how data science can prevent bias from entering statistical algorithms. Baer expertly addresses some of the 100+ varieties of natural bias such as confirmation bias, stability bias, pattern-recognition bias, and many others. Algorithmic bias mirrors—and originates in—these human tendencies. Baer dives into topics as diverse as anomaly detection, hybrid model structures, and self-improving machine learning.</p><p> </p><p>While most writings on algorithmic bias focus on the dangers, the core of this positive, fun book points toward a path where bias is kept at bay and even eliminated. You’ll come away with managerial techniques to develop unbiased algorithms, the ability to detect bias more quickly, and knowledge to create unbiased data. <i><b>Understand, Manage, and Prevent Algorithmic Bias</b></i> is an innovative, timely, and important book that belongs on your shelf. Whether you are a seasoned business executive, a data scientist, or simply an enthusiast, now is a crucial time to be educated about the impact of algorithmic bias on society and take an active role in fighting bias.</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What You'll Learn</b></p><p></p><ul><li>Study the many sources of algorithmic bias, including cognitive biases in the real world, biased data, and statistical artifact<br/></li><li>Understand the risks of algorithmic biases, how to detect them, and managerial techniques to prevent or manage them<br/></li><li>Appreciate how machine learning both introduces new sources of algorithmic bias and can be a part of a solution</li><li>Be familiar with specific statistical techniques a data scientist can use to detect and overcome algorithmic bias<br/></li></ul><p></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Who This Book is For</b></p><p>Business executives of companies using algorithms in daily operations; data scientists (from students to seasoned practitioners) developing algorithms; compliance officials concerned about algorithmic bias; politicians, journalists, and philosophers thinking about algorithmic bias in terms of its impact on society and possible regulatory responses; and consumers concerned about how they might be affected by algorithmic bias</p></span>",
