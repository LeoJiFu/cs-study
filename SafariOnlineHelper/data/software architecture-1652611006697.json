    "description": "<span><span><div><p>In this anticipated video series, Neal Ford and Mark Richards examine the responsibilities of a software architect, specifically the knowledge and skills you need to be effective in that role.</p><p>The first video in the series, <b><i>Software Architecture Fundamentals Understanding the Basics</i></b>, not only introduces development techniques, but also pinpoints the skills you need to be a successful team leader. You’ll learn about the four main aspects of a software architect, and quickly discover the difference between architecture decisions and technology decisions. In this video, you’ll explore:</p><p><b>Soft Skills:</b></p><ul><li>Investigate techniques for communicating effectively as a team leader</li><li>Measure your technical knowledge, including technical depth vs. technical breadth, and multi-platform skills</li><li>Discover how to increase your expertise of business domains</li><li>Learn how ensure a successful implementation by matching methodology with architecture</li></ul><b>Architectural Techniques:</b><ul><li>Make your architecture more adaptable to changes in business and technology</li><li>Explore various techniques and patterns for integrating multiple applications and databases</li><li>Get a true understanding of enterprise architecture by examining the context and goals of an EA implementation</li></ul><p>The topics in this video set the stage necessary to understand the enterprise architecture approaches and strategies demonstrated in the series’ next video: <i>Software Architecture Fundamentals Beyond the Basics</i>.</p><p><b>About the presenters</b></p><p>Neal Ford is Director, Software Architect, and Meme Wrangler at ThoughtWorks, a global IT consultancy. Proficient in a variety of languages, paradigms, and architectural styles, his primary consulting focus is the design and construction of large-scale enterprise applications.</p><p>Mark Richards is an experienced hands-on software architect involved in the architecture, design, and implementation of microservices architectures, service oriented architectures, and distributed systems in J2EE and other technologies.</p><p><i>Clearing a path from developer to architect and enriching that path once you arrive.</i></p><p>Software architecture is a fast-moving, multidisciplinary subject where entire suites of \"best practices\" become obsolete practically overnight. No single path or curriculum exists, and different types of architecture—application, integration, enterprise—require different subject emphasis.

Eric thinks that learning about your problem domain is as\nlikely to happen at the end of your project as at the beginning,\nand so refactoring is a big part of his technique.</p><p>“The book is a fun read. Eric has lots\nof interesting stories, and he has a way with words. I see this\nbook as essential reading for software developers—it is a\nfuture classic.”</p><p>—<b>Ralph Johnson</b>, author of\n<em>Design Patterns</em></p><p>“If you don’t think you are\ngetting value from your investment in object-oriented programming,\nthis book will tell you what you’ve forgotten to do.</p><p>“Eric Evans convincingly argues for\nthe importance of domain modeling as the central focus of\ndevelopment and provides a solid framework and set of techniques\nfor accomplishing it. This is timeless wisdom, and will hold up\nlong after the methodologies du jour have gone out of\nfashion.”</p><p>—<b>Dave Collins</b>, author of\n<em>Designing Object-Oriented User Interfaces</em></p><p>“Eric weaves real-world experience\nmodeling—and building—business applications into a\npractical, useful book. Written from the perspective of a trusted\npractitioner, Eric’s descriptions of ubiquitous language, the\nbenefits of sharing models with users, object life-cycle\nmanagement, logical and physical application structuring, and the\nprocess and results of deep refactoring are major contributions to\nour field.”</p><p>—<b>Luke Hohmann</b>, author of\n<em>Beyond Software Architecture</em></p><p>“This book belongs on the shelf of\nevery thoughtful software developer.”</p><p>—<b>Kent Beck</b></p><p>“What Eric has managed to capture is a\npart of the design process that experienced object designers have\nalways used, but that we have been singularly unsuccessful as a\ngroup in conveying to the rest of the industry. We've given away\nbits and pieces of this knowledge...but we've never organized and\nsystematized the principles of building domain logic. This book is\nimportant.”</p><p>—<b>Kyle Brown</b>, author of\n<em>Enterprise Java™ Programming with IBM<sup>®</sup>\nWebSphere<sup>®</sup></em></p><p>The software development community widely\nacknowledges that domain modeling is central to software design.\nThrough domain models, software developers are able to express rich\nfunctionality and translate it into a software implementation that\ntruly serves the needs of its users. But despite its obvious\nimportance, there are few practical resources that explain how to\nincorporate effective domain modeling into the software development\nprocess.</p><p><b><em>Domain-Driven Design</em></b> fills\nthat need. This is not a book about specific technologies. It\noffers readers a systematic approach to domain-driven design,\npresenting an extensive set of design best practices,\nexperience-based techniques, and fundamental principles that\nfacilitate the development of software projects facing complex\ndomains. Intertwining design and development practice, this book\nincorporates numerous examples based on actual projects to\nillustrate the application of domain-driven design to real-world\nsoftware development.</p><p>Readers learn how to use a domain model to\nmake a complex development effort more focused and dynamic. A core\nof best practices and standard patterns provides a common language\nfor the development team. A shift in emphasis—refactoring not\njust the code but the model underlying the code—in\ncombination with the frequent iterations of Agile development leads\nto deeper insight into domains and enhanced communication between\ndomain expert and programmer. <b><em>Domain-Driven Design</em></b>\nthen builds on this foundation, and addresses modeling and design\nfor complex systems and larger organizations.Specific topics\ncovered include:</p><li><p>Getting all team members to speak the same language</p></li><li><p>Connecting model and implementation more deeply</p></li><li><p>Sharpening key distinctions in a model</p></li><li><p>Managing the lifecycle of a domain object</p></li><li><p>Writing domain code that is safe to combine in elaborate\nways</p></li><li><p>Making complex code obvious and predictable</p></li><li><p>Formulating a domain vision statement</p></li><li><p>Distilling the core of a complex domain</p></li><li><p>Digging out implicit concepts needed in the model</p></li><li><p>Applying analysis patterns</p></li><li><p>Relating design patterns to the model</p></li><li><p>Maintaining model integrity in a large system</p></li><li><p>Dealing with coexisting models on the same project</p></li><li><p>Organizing systems with large-scale structures</p></li><li><p>Recognizing and responding to modeling breakthroughs</p></li><p>With this book in hand, object-oriented\ndevelopers, system analysts, and designers will have the guidance\nthey need to organize and focus their work, create rich and useful\ndomain models, and leverage those models into quality, long-lasting\nsoftware implementations.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>In this anticipated video series, Neal Ford and Mark Richards examine the responsibilities of a software architect, specifically the knowledge and skills you need to be effective in that role.</p><p>The second video in the series, <b><i>Software Architecture Fundamentals Beyond the Basics</i></b>, advances the discussion from Developer to Architect by covering application, integration, and enterprise architecture. You’ll evaluate architectures (including making formal processes like ATAM more agile and effective) and various architectural frameworks:</p><ul><li><b>Application architecture:</b> Understand the impact that modern engineering practices like Continuous Delivery have on architectural decisions. You’ll learn about different abstractions, their pros and cons, and how to effectively choose between them.</li><li><b>Integration architecture:</b> Examine the pros and cons of SOAP vs REST, as well as integration hubs like ESBs as an architectural pattern, and some common integration patterns.</li><li><b>Enterprise architecture:</b> Delve into centralized and decentralized approaches, 4 types of strategies for decision making, and evolutionary architecture and emergent design.</li></ul><p>Discussion augments the material throughout, providing differing opinions and contexts on many subjects.</p><p><b>About the presenters</b></p><p>Neal is Director, Software Architect, and Meme Wrangler at ThoughtWorks, a global IT consultancy with an exclusive focus on end-to-end software development and delivery. Before joining ThoughtWorks, Neal was the Chief Technology Officer at The DSW Group, Ltd., a nationally recognized training and development firm.</p><p>Mark Richards is an experienced hands-on software architect involved in the architecture, design, and implementation of microservices architectures, service oriented architectures, and distributed systems in J2EE and other technologies.</p><p><i>Clearing a path from developer to architect and enriching that path once you arrive.</i></p><p>Software architecture is a fast-moving, multidisciplinary subject where entire suites of \"best practices\" become obsolete practically overnight. No single path or curriculum exists, and different types of architecture—application, integration, enterprise—require different subject emphasis. Whether you’re at the outset of a career as an architect or in the midst of such a career, series editor Neal Ford has curated this collection of tools and guides for aspiring and seasoned architects alike.</p></div></span></span>",

This one's a\nkeeper.”</em> --Robert C. Martin</p><p><em>“If you want to be an expert in the state of the art in\nTDD, you need to understand the ideas in this\nbook.”--</em>Michael Feathers</p><p>Test-Driven Development (TDD) is now an\nestablished technique for delivering better software faster. TDD is\nbased on a simple idea: Write tests for your code before you write\nthe code itself. However, this \"simple\" idea takes skill and\njudgment to do well. Now there's a practical guide to TDD that\ntakes you beyond the basic concepts. Drawing on a decade of\nexperience building real-world systems, two TDD pioneers show how\nto let tests guide your development and “grow” software\nthat is coherent, reliable, and maintainable.</p><p>Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce describe the\nprocesses they use, the design principles they strive to achieve,\nand some of the tools that help them get the job done. Through an\nextended worked example, you’ll learn how TDD works at\nmultiple levels, using tests to drive the features and the\nobject-oriented structure of the code, and using Mock Objects to\ndiscover and then describe relationships between objects. Along the\nway, the book systematically addresses challenges that development\nteams encounter with TDD--from integrating TDD into your processes\nto testing your most difficult features. Coverage includes</p><p>•   Implementing TDD\neffectively: getting started, and maintaining your momentum</p><p>    throughout the\nproject</p><p>•   Creating cleaner, more\nexpressive, more sustainable code</p><p>•   Using tests to stay\nrelentlessly focused on sustaining quality</p><p>•   Understanding how TDD,\nMock Objects, and Object-Oriented Design come together</p><p>    in the context of a real\nsoftware development project</p><p>•   Using Mock Objects to\nguide object-oriented designs</p><p>•   Succeeding where TDD is\ndifficult: managing complex test data, and testing persistence</p><p>    and concurrency</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>The practice of enterprise application development has benefited from the emergence of many new enabling technologies. Multi-tiered object-oriented platforms, such as Java and .NET, have become commonplace. These new tools and technologies are capable of building powerful applications, but they are not easily implemented. Common failures in enterprise applications often occur because their developers do not understand the architectural lessons that experienced object developers have learned.</p><p><strong><em>Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</em></strong> is written in direct response to the stiff challenges that face enterprise application developers. The author, noted object-oriented designer Martin Fowler, noticed that despite changes in technology--from Smalltalk to CORBA to Java to .NET--the same basic design ideas can be adapted and applied to solve common problems. With the help of an expert group of contributors, Martin distills over forty recurring solutions into patterns. The result is an indispensable handbook of solutions that are applicable to any enterprise application platform.</p><p>This book is actually two books in one. The first section is a short tutorial on developing enterprise applications, which you can read from start to finish to understand the scope of the book's lessons. The next section, the bulk of the book, is a detailed reference to the patterns themselves. Each pattern provides usage and implementation information, as well as detailed code examples in Java or C#. The entire book is also richly illustrated with UML diagrams to further explain the concepts.</p><p>Armed with this book, you will have the knowledge necessary to make important architectural decisions about building an enterprise application and the proven patterns for use when building them.</p><p>The topics covered include</p><p>· Dividing an enterprise application into layers</p><p>· The major approaches to organizing business logic</p><p>· An in-depth treatment of mapping between objects and relational databases</p><p>· Using Model-View-Controller to organize a Web presentation</p><p>· Handling concurrency for data that spans multiple transactions</p><p>· Designing distributed object interfaces</p></div></span>",

    "title": "Architecture Patterns with Python",
    "description": "<span><div><p>As Python continues to grow in popularity, projects are becoming larger and more complex. Many Python developers are taking an interest in high-level software design patterns such as hexagonal/clean architecture, event-driven architecture, and the strategic patterns prescribed by domain-driven design (DDD). But translating those patterns into Python isn’t always straightforward.<br/><br/>With this hands-on guide, Harry Percival and Bob Gregory from MADE.com introduce proven architectural design patterns to help Python developers manage application complexity—and get the most value out of their test suites. <br/><br/>Each pattern is illustrated with concrete examples in beautiful, idiomatic Python, avoiding some of the verbosity of Java and C# syntax. Patterns include:</p><ul><li>Dependency inversion and its links to ports and adapters (hexagonal/clean architecture)</li><li>Domain-driven design’s distinction between Entities, Value Objects, and Aggregates </li><li>Repository and Unit of Work patterns for persistent storage</li><li>Events, commands, and the message bus</li><li>Command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS)</li><li>Event-driven architecture and reactive microservices</li></ul></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p><strong>Concise, One-Hour Video Introduction to Microservice Architecture</strong></p><p>Agile practices and techniques, such as continuous delivery, are about being able to react to changes rapidly. However, putting them into practice when you have a big monolith application can be difficult. A microservice architecture offers one solution.</p><p>Breaking the monolith and moving toward a microservice architecture can offer significant advantages to organizations, in terms of improving team autonomy and increasing frequency of change. These benefits, however, come at a cost. Teams are not always aware of the additional complexity associated with distributed systems and the level of maturity and investment that organizations require to succeed with them.</p><p>In <em><strong>Moving to Microservices LiveLessons,</strong></em> Maria Gomez, a lead consultant at Thoughtworks, introduces considerations and best practices for moving to microservices. Gomez first defines the prerequisites for moving into a microservice architecture. She helps you understand the relative cost of the changes involved so that you can decide whether they are worth it for your organization. With step-by-step examples using domain-driven design (DDD) and other extreme programming (XP) techniques, she then demonstrates how to break down your existing monolith into independent, cooperating entities.</p><p><strong>About the Instructor</strong></p><p>Maria Gomez is a tech lead and lead consultant at ThoughtWorks.

    "description": "<span><div><p>You want increased customer satisfaction, faster development cycles, and less wasted work. Domain-driven design (DDD) combined with functional programming is the innovative combo that will get you there. In this pragmatic, down-to-earth guide, you'll see how applying the core principles of functional programming can result in software designs that model real-world requirements both elegantly and concisely - often more so than an object-oriented approach. Practical examples in the open-source F# functional language, and examples from familiar business domains, show you how to apply these techniques to build software that is business-focused, flexible, and high quality.</p><p>Domain-driven design is a well-established approach to designing software that ensures that domain experts and developers work together effectively to create high-quality software. This book is the first to combine DDD with techniques from statically typed functional programming. This book is perfect for newcomers to DDD or functional programming - all the techniques you need will be introduced and explained.</p><p>Model a complex domain accurately using the F# type system, creating compilable code that is also readable documentation---ensuring that the code and design never get out of sync. Encode business rules in the design so that you have \"compile-time unit tests,\" and eliminate many potential bugs by making illegal states unrepresentable. Assemble a series of small, testable functions into a complete use case, and compose these individual scenarios into a large-scale design. Discover why the combination of functional programming and DDD leads naturally to service-oriented and hexagonal architectures. Finally, create a functional domain model that works with traditional databases, NoSQL, and event stores, and safely expose your domain via a website or API.</p><p>Solve real problems by focusing on real-world requirements for your software.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>The code in this book is designed to be run interactively on Windows, Mac and Linux.You will need a recent version of F# (4.0 or greater), and the appropriate .NET runtime for your platform.Full installation instructions for all platforms at fsharp.org.</p></div></span>",

By describing the overall characteristics of the architecture, these patterns not only guide designers and developers on how to design components, but also determine the ways in which those components should interact.</p><p>This O’Reilly report takes a deep dive into many common software architecture patterns. Each pattern includes a full explanation of how it works, explains the pattern’s benefits and considerations, and describes the circumstances and conditions it was designed to address. The report also includes an analysis and scorecard for each pattern based on several architecture and software development quality attributes.</p><p>Patterns include:</p><ul><li>Layered architecture</li><li>Event-driven architecture</li><li>Microkernel architecture</li><li>Microservices architecture</li><li>Space-based architecture</li></ul><p>In addition to these specific patterns, you’ll also learn about the Architecture by Implication anti-pattern and the causes and effects of not using architecture patterns.</p></div></span>",

Now, for the first time, there’s an accessible guide to the basics of DDD: What it is, what problems it solves, how it works, and how to quickly gain value from it.</p><p>Concise, readable, and actionable, <b><i>Domain-Driven Design Distilled</i></b> never buries you in detail–it focuses on what you need to know to get results. Vaughn Vernon, author of the best-selling <i>Implementing Domain-Driven Design,</i> draws on his twenty years of experience applying DDD principles to real-world situations. He is uniquely well-qualified to demystify its complexities, illuminate its subtleties, and help you solve the problems you might encounter.</p><p>Vernon guides you through each core DDD technique for building better software. You’ll learn how to segregate domain models using the powerful Bounded Contexts pattern, to develop a Ubiquitous Language within an explicitly bounded context, and to help domain experts and developers work together to create that language. Vernon shows how to use Subdomains to handle legacy systems and to integrate multiple Bounded Contexts to define both team relationships and technical mechanisms.</p><p><b><i>Domain-Driven Design Distilled</i></b> brings DDD to life. Whether you’re a developer, architect, analyst, consultant, or customer, Vernon helps you truly understand it so you can benefit from its remarkable power.</p><p>Coverage includes</p><ul><li>What DDD can do for you and your organization–and why it’s so important</li><li>The cornerstones of strategic design with DDD: Bounded Contexts and Ubiquitous Language</li><li>Strategic design with Subdomains</li><li>Context Mapping: helping teams work together and integrate software more strategically</li><li>Tactical design with Aggregates and Domain Events</li><li>Using project acceleration and management tools to establish and maintain team cadence</li></ul></span>",

But, unreasonable deadlines and shortcuts make it very hard to create such an architecture.\n</p><p>Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean Architecture starts with a discussion about the conventional layered architecture style and its disadvantages. It also talks about the advantages of the domain-centric architecture styles of Robert C. Martin's Clean Architecture and Alistair Cockburn's Hexagonal Architecture. Then, the book dives into hands-on chapters that show you how to manifest a hexagonal architecture in actual code. You'll learn in detail about different mapping strategies between the layers of a hexagonal architecture and see how to assemble the architecture elements into an application. The later chapters demonstrate how to enforce architecture boundaries. You'll also learn what shortcuts produce what types of technical debt and how, sometimes, it is a good idea to willingly take on those debts.\n</p><p>After reading this book, you'll have all the knowledge you need to create applications using the hexagonal architecture style of web development.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Identify potential shortcomings of using a layered architecture\n</li><li>Apply methods to enforce architecture boundaries\n</li><li>Find out how potential shortcuts can affect the software architecture\n</li><li>Produce arguments for when to use which style of architecture\n</li><li>Structure your code according to the architecture\n</li><li>Apply various types of tests that will cover each element of the architecture</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book is for you if you care about the architecture of the software you are building. To get the most out of this book, you must have some experience with web development. The code examples in this book are in Java. If you are not a Java programmer but can read object-oriented code in other languages, you will be fine. In the few places where Java or framework specifics are needed, they are thoroughly explained.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p><em>“This new edition is brighter, shinier, more complete,\nmore pragmatic, more focused than the previous one, and I\nwouldn’t have thought it possible to improve on the original.\nAs the field of software architecture has grown over these past\ndecades, there is much more to be said, much more that we know, and\nmuch more that we can reflect upon of what’s worked and what\nhasn’t—and the authors here do all that, and\nmore.”</em></p><p>—From the Foreword by Grady Booch,\nIBM Fellow</p><p>Software architecture—the conceptual glue that holds every\nphase of a project together for its many stakeholders—is\nwidely recognized as a critical element in modern software\ndevelopment. Practitioners have increasingly discovered that close\nattention to a software system’s architecture pays valuable\ndividends. Without an architecture that is appropriate for the\nproblem being solved, a project will stumble along or, most likely,\nfail. Even with a superb architecture, if that architecture is not\nwell understood or well communicated the project is unlikely to\nsucceed.</p><p><b><em>Documenting Software Architectures,\nSecond Edition,</em></b> provides the most complete and current\nguidance, independent of language or notation, on how to capture an\narchitecture in a commonly understandable form. Drawing on their\nextensive experience, the authors first help you decide what\ninformation to document, and then, with guidelines and examples (in\nvarious notations, including UML), show you how to express an\narchitecture so that others can successfully build, use, and\nmaintain a system from it. The book features rules for sound\ndocumentation, the goals and strategies of documentation,\narchitectural views and styles, documentation for software\ninterfaces and software behavior, and templates for capturing and\norganizing information to generate a coherent package. New and\nimproved in this second edition:</p><li><p>Coverage of architectural styles such as service-oriented\narchitectures, multi-tier architectures, and data models</p></li><li><p>Guidance for documentation in an Agile development\nenvironment</p></li><li><p>Deeper treatment of documentation of rationale, reflecting best\nindustrial practices</p></li><li><p>Improved templates, reflecting years of use and feedback, and\nmore documentation layout options</p></li><li><p>A new, comprehensive example (available online), featuring\ndocumentation of a Web-based service-oriented system</p></li><li><p>Reference guides for three important architecture documentation\nlanguages: UML, AADL, and SySML</p></li></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><span><span><p>Just as developers use design patterns in software development, architects use well-defined architecture patterns to define the characteristics and shape of the architecture. Using the wrong architecture pattern (or no pattern at all) can sometimes be a very costly mistake resulting in an architecture that doesn't work. It is therefore vital that architects are aware of and understand the various architecture patterns available. During this webcast I will discuss several common architecture patterns, including the traditional layered architecture, microservices architecture, space-based architecture, event-driven architecture, and microkernel architecture. Along the way I will show real-world examples to demonstrate how the patterns work, as well as describe the pros and cons of each pattern. I will also discuss how requirements and operational aspects can drive which patterns to use. Using the right architecture pattern for your system is critical, because as we all know, once in place the architecture is very hard to change.</p></span></span></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p><strong>Right Your Software and Transform Your Career</strong></p><p><em><strong>Righting Software</strong></em> presents the proven, structured, and highly engineered approach to software design that renowned architect Juval Löwy has practiced and taught around the world. Although companies of every kind have successfully implemented his original design ideas across hundreds of systems, these insights have never before appeared in print.</p><p>Based on first principles in software engineering and a comprehensive set of matching tools and techniques, Löwy’s methodology integrates system design and project design. First, he describes the primary area where many software architects fail and shows how to decompose a system into smaller building blocks or services, based on volatility. Next, he shows how to flow an effective project design from the system design; how to accurately calculate the project duration, cost, and risk; and how to devise multiple execution options.</p><p>The method and principles in <em><strong>Righting Software</strong></em> apply regardless of your project and company size, technology, platform, or industry. Löwy starts the reader on a journey that addresses the critical challenges of software development today by righting software systems and projects as well as careers–and possibly the software industry as a whole. Software professionals, architects, project leads, or managers at any stage of their career will benefit greatly from this book, which provides guidance and knowledge that would otherwise take decades and many projects to acquire.</p><p><em>Register your book for convenient access to downloads, updates, and/or corrections as they become available.

We then look at the requirements\n(quality attributes) that drive architecture-things like\nperformance, modifiability, security, and so forth. We learn how to\nelicit, prioritize, and characterize these quality attributes\nprecisely and unambiguously. Then we will talk about the\nbuilding-blocks of architecture: patterns and tactics. Using this\nknowledge we will go over a method for architecture design called\nADD (Attribute Driven Design). Having designed (or inherited) an\narchitecture, you may want to analyze it, to understand its\nstrengths and weaknesses. To achieve this we present a method\ncalled the ATAM (Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method). Finally we\nfinish up with some practical advice for practicing architects such\nas: how to blend architect activities with agile methodologies, and\nhow to be an agent for change in an organization.</p><p><b>Skill Level</b></p><ul><li>Intermediate</li><li>Advanced</li></ul><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>What is Software Architecture</li><li>Architectural Requirements: Quality Attributes</li><li>Architectural Patterns and Tactics</li><li>Architecture Design</li><li>Architecture Analysis</li><li>Architecture in Agile Projects</li></ul><p><b>Who Should Take This Course</b></p><ul><li>Developers looking \"go to the next level\" in their organization\nand become architects and leaders.</li></ul><p><b>Course Requirements</b></p><ul><li>Basic understanding of programming and development</li><li>Basic understanding of the software engineering lifecycle and\nproject activities</li></ul><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><p><b>Lesson 1: Course Intro/What is Software Architecture</b></p><p><p>1.1 Define software architecture \n<br/>1.2 Explain why software architecture is important\n<br/>1.3 Document an architecture\n<br/>1.4 Understand the importance of architectural patterns and\nreference architectures\n<br/>1.5 Distinguish a good architecture</p></p><p><b>Lesson 2: Architecture Requirements: Quality Attributes</b></p><p><p>2.1 Distinguish functionality from Quality Attributes (QAs)\n<br/>2.2 Specify quality attribute requirements\n<br/>2.3 Recognize other requirements that drive an\narchitecture</p></p><p><b>Lesson 3: Gathering Architectural Requirements</b></p><p><p>3.1 Identify problems in eliciting actionable architectural\nrequirements\n<br/>3.2 Use the Quality Attribute Workshop (QAW)\n<br/>3.3 Use the Quality Attribute Utility Tree</p></p><p><b>Lesson 4: Architectural Patterns and Tactics</b></p><p><p>4.1 Use architectural patterns\n<br/>4.2 Use architectural tactics\n<br/>4.3 Understand how tactics interact with patterns</p></p><p><b>Lesson 5: Creating the Architecture Tactics</b></p><p><p>5.1 Design an architecture\n<br/>5.2 Understand a model design problem\n<br/>5.3 Follow the steps of ADD</p></p><p><b>Lesson 6: Architecture Evaluation</b></p><p><p>6.1 Understand the forms of arcitecture evaluation\n<br/>6.2 Follow the steps of the ATAM\n<br/>6.3 Use thelLightweight ATAM</p></p><p><b>Lesson 7: Architectures in Agile Projects</b></p><p><p>7.1 Understand the concepts of Agile \n<br/>7.2 See the relationship between agility and architecture\n<br/>7.3 Follow guidelines for Agile architects</p></p><p><b>Lesson 8: Epilogue</b></p><p><p>8.1 The Value of Architecture</p></p><p><b>Summary</b></p><p> </p><p><b>About LiveLessons Video Training</b><b><br/></b>LiveLessons Video Training series publishes hundreds of\nhands-on, expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of\ntechnology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to\nsucceed.

Traditionally virtual machines and containers were the main options for deploying microservices but they involve a lot of operational effort, configuration, and maintenance. More recently, there has been a growing interest in Serverless computing due to the increase in developer productivity, built in auto-scaling abilities, and reduced operational costs. In combining both microservices and serverless computing, organizations will benefit from having the servers and capacity planning managed by the cloud provider, making them much easier to deploy and run at scale.</p><p>In this course we show you how to build an end-to-end serverless application for your organization. We have selected a data API use case that could reduce costs and give you more flexibility in how you and your clients consume or present your application, metrics and insight data. We make use of the latest serverless deployment and build framework, share our experience on testing, and provide best practices for running a serverless stack in a production environment.</p></span>",

Through practical exercises and code examples, you will learn how end-to-end tracing can be used as a powerful application performance management and comprehension tool. \n</p><p>The rise of Internet-scale companies, like Google and Amazon, ushered in a new era of distributed systems operating on thousands of nodes across multiple data centers. Microservices increased that complexity, often exponentially. It is harder to debug these systems, track down failures, detect bottlenecks, or even simply understand what is going on. Distributed tracing focuses on solving these problems for complex distributed systems. Today, tracing standards have developed and we have much faster systems, making instrumentation less intrusive and data more valuable.\n</p><p>Yuri Shkuro, the creator of Jaeger, a popular open-source distributed tracing system, delivers end-to-end coverage of the field in Mastering Distributed Tracing. Review the history and theoretical foundations of tracing; solve the data gathering problem through code instrumentation, with open standards like OpenTracing, W3C Trace Context, and OpenCensus; and discuss the benefits and applications of a distributed tracing infrastructure for understanding, and profiling, complex systems.\n</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>How to get started with using a distributed tracing system\n</li><li>How to get the most value out of end-to-end tracing\n</li><li>Learn about open standards in the space\n</li><li>Learn about code instrumentation and operating a tracing infrastructure\n</li><li>Learn where distributed tracing fits into microservices as a core function</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>Any developer interested in testing large systems will find this book very revealing and in places, surprising. Every microservice architect and developer should have an insight into distributed tracing, and the book will help them on their way. System administrators with some development skills will also benefit. No particular programming language skills are required, although an ability to read Java, while non-essential, will help with the core chapters.</p></span>",

This third edition of Python 3 Object-Oriented Programming fully explains classes, data encapsulation, and exceptions with an emphasis on when you can use each principle to develop well-designed software.</p><p>Starting with a detailed analysis of object-oriented programming, you will use the Python programming language to clearly grasp key concepts from the object-oriented paradigm. You will learn how to create maintainable applications by studying higher level design patterns. The book will show you the complexities of string and file manipulation, and how Python distinguishes between binary and textual data. Not one, but two very powerful automated testing systems, unittest and pytest, will be introduced in this book. You'll get a comprehensive introduction to Python's concurrent programming ecosystem.</p><p>By the end of the book, you will have thoroughly learned object-oriented principles using Python syntax and be able to create robust and reliable programs confidently.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Implement objects in Python by creating classes and defining methods</li><li>Grasp common concurrency techniques and pitfalls in Python 3</li><li>Extend class functionality using inheritance</li><li>Understand when to use object-oriented features, and more importantly when not to use them</li><li>Discover what design patterns are and why they are different in Python</li><li>Uncover the simplicity of unit testing and why it's so important in Python</li><li>Explore concurrent object-oriented programming</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>If you're new to object-oriented programming techniques, or if you have basic Python skills and wish to learn in depth how and when to correctly apply OOP in Python, this is the book for you. If you are an object-oriented programmer for other languages or seeking a leg up in the new world of Python 3.8, you too will find this book a useful introduction to Python.

    "description": "<span><p>The Complete Guide to Writing Maintainable, Manageable, Pleasing, and Powerful Object-Oriented Applications</p><p>Object-oriented programming languages have a point of view about how best to model the world. They exist to help you create beautiful, straightforward applications that are easy to change and simple to extend. Unfortunately, the world is awash with object-oriented (OO) applications that are difficult to understand and expensive to change. Even though they’re written in OO languages, these applications fail to achieve the promise of OO because their code doesn’t reflect the right mindset. The purpose of <i><b>Practical Object-Oriented Design, Second Edition,</b></i> is to solve that problem by immersing you in an OO mindset. It teaches powerful, real-world, object-oriented design techniques using simple and practical examples. It will change the way you think about code.</p><p>Sandi Metz has distilled a lifetime of conversations and presentations about object-oriented design into a proven set of OO practices for crafting manageable, extensible, and pleasing code. She demonstrates how to build new applications that can “survive success” and how to repair those that have become impossible to change. Each technique is illustrated with extended examples in the easy-to-understand Ruby programming language, all downloadable from the companion website, <a href=\"http://poodr.com\">poodr.com</a>. Fully updated for Ruby 2.5, this guide shows how to:</p><ul><li>Decide what belongs in a single class</li><li>Avoid entangling objects that should be kept separate</li><li>Define flexible interfaces among objects</li><li>Reduce programming overhead costs with duck typing</li><li>Successfully apply inheritance</li><li>Build objects via composition</li><li>Design cost-effective tests</li><li>Solve common problems associated with poorly designed object-oriented code</li></ul><p>Whatever your previous object-oriented experience, this concise guide will help you achieve the superior outcomes you’re looking for.</p></span>",

The aim throughout this course is not to give you just cookie cutter examples but instead to give you a thorough understanding of the Lambda platform and programming model, so you’ll have confidence building your own Serverless applications.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Description<br/>\n</strong>Serverless is a new cloud computing approach to architecting and building applications. It enables faster delivery of business value and reduced operational cost and complexity, together with virtually limitless and effortless scaling. The core technology class of a Serverless architecture is Functions-as-a-Service, and the most mature Functions-as-a-Service product is Lambda, from Amazon Web Services. AWS Lambda LiveLessons is designed to give you a thorough understanding of the Lambda platform and programming model, so you’ll have confidence building your own Serverless applications.<br/>\n<br/>\n \n Although AWS Lambda natively supports several languages, including Javascript, Python and C#, this video tutorial uses Java and its Java Virtual Machine as the development language and runtime for all examples.<br/>\n<br/>\n \n The video starts off by introducing Serverless and answering the question, “What is Lambda?” It explains Serverless fundamentals and compares the different Serverless technology classes of Backend-as-a-Service and Functions-as-a-Service, as well as the benefits and limitations of Serverless.<br/>\n<br/>\n \n Next, Roberts and Chapin review the necessary environment prerequisites before showing you how to code and execute your first Lambda function. They then drill down into some details of the Lambda model and show you how to build a Lambda-backed web application using API Gateway.<br/>\n<br/>\n \n Finally, the course covers some additional theory to give you a more advanced understanding of AWS Lambda. Roberts and Chapin close by looking more holistically at Serverless architectures and providing a detailed overview of Serverless technology beyond AWS Lambda, including a range of examples of how Serverless architectures are built in the real world.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>AWS Lambda LiveLessons</em> consists of seven lessons totaling more than 4 hours of instruction. The videos feature easy-to-understand explanations of key concepts, realistic examples, and demonstrations of industrial-grade deployments.</p><p>View the link resources compiled for this LiveLesson at <a href=\"http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/imprint_downloads/informit/bookreg/9780134840918/aws_lambda_livelesson_resources.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/imprint_downloads/informit/bookreg/9780134840918/aws_lambda_livelesson_resources.pdf</a>.</p><p><strong>About the Instructors</strong></p><strong>Mike Roberts</strong> is an engineering leader and cofounder of Symphonia, a Serverless and cloud technology consultancy based in New York City.

Attractive features and high utility breed success, which brings more requests to handle and more data to manage. But organizations reach a tipping point when design decisions that made sense under light loads suddenly become technical debt. This practical book covers design approaches and technologies that make it possible to scale an application quickly and cost-effectively.</p><p>Author Ian Gorton takes software architects and developers through the principles of foundational distributed systems. You'll explore the essential ingredients of scalable solutions, including replication, state management, load balancing, and caching. Specific chapters focus on the implications of scalability for databases, microservices, and event-based streaming systems.</p><p>You will focus on:</p><ul><li><b>Foundations of scalable systems:</b> Learn basic design principles of scalability, its costs, and architectural tradeoffs</li><li><b>Designing scalable services:</b> Dive into service design, caching, asynchronous messaging, serverless processing, and microservices</li><li><b>Designing scalable data systems:</b> Learn data system fundamentals, NoSQL databases, and eventual consistency versus strong consistency</li><li><b>Designing scalable streaming systems:</b> Explore stream processing systems and scalable event-driven processing</li></ul></div></span>",

Programming and technology is only one side of a software architect’s skillset. Along with being an excellent developer, you also have to be a communicator and a leader. People skills help you work well within a larger corporate structure, manage teams, and ensure that technology is a first-level concern at your company.</p><p>In this video, you’ll learn how to:</p><ul><li> Control various types of architecture boundaries and the personalities that form them</li><li> Work with members of your architecture team by using techniques and best practices</li><li> Cope with meetings imposed on you and meetings you impose on others</li><li> Become an effective technical leader by honing your skills</li><li> Delve into the relationship between software architecture, team structure, and the impact of Conway’s Law when designing systems</li><li> Use negotiating skills to drive consensus and understand tradeoffs with stakeholders, technologists, and team members</li><li> Build your personal technology radar as a way to investigate new technologies in a structured way</li><li> Crowd-source technology decisions within your organization by building a companywide technology radar</li></ul><p><strong>About the presenters</strong></p><p>Neal is Director, Software Architect, and Meme Wrangler at ThoughtWorks, a global IT consultancy with an exclusive focus on end-to-end software development and delivery. Before joining ThoughtWorks, Neal was the Chief Technology Officer at The DSW Group, Ltd., a nationally recognized training and development firm.</p><p>Mark Richards is an experienced hands-on software architect involved in the architecture, design, and implementation of microservices architectures, service oriented architectures, and distributed systems in J2EE and other technologies.<i>Clearing a path from developer to architect and enriching that path once you arrive.</i></p><p>Software architecture is a fast-moving, multidisciplinary subject where entire suites of \"best practices\" become obsolete practically overnight. No single path or curriculum exists, and different types of architecture—application, integration, enterprise—require different subject emphasis. Whether you’re at the outset of a career as an architect or in the midst of such a career, series editor Neal Ford has curated this collection of tools and guides for aspiring and seasoned architects alike.</p></div></span></span></span>",

Juval will contrast it with the most common mistake done in architecture, using functionality to identify services. These are universal design principles, and Juval will use examples from software and non-software systems alike. You will also see how to overcome the real hurdles architects face perusing volatility-based decomposing, simple and practical techniques for identifying areas of volatility, common telltale signs or \"smells\" when your design is still functional when using the Method, IDesign's approach for system architecture.</p></span></span></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>This award-winning book, substantially updated to reflect the\nlatest developments in the field, introduces the concepts and best\npractices of software architecture--how a software system is\nstructured and how that system's elements are meant to interact.\nDistinct from the details of implementation, algorithm, and data\nrepresentation, an architecture holds the key to achieving system\nquality, is a reusable asset that can be applied to subsequent\nsystems, and is crucial to a software organization's business\nstrategy.</p><p>Drawing on their own extensive experience, the authors cover the\nessential technical topics for designing, specifying, and\nvalidating a system. They also emphasize the importance of the\nbusiness context in which large systems are designed. Their aim is\nto present software architecture in a real-world setting,\nreflecting both the opportunities and constraints that companies\nencounter. To that end, case studies that describe successful\narchitectures illustrate key points of both technical and\norganizational discussions.</p><p>Topics new to this edition include:</p><li><p>Architecture design and analysis, including the Architecture\nTradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM)</p></li><li><p>Capturing quality requirements and achieving them through\nquality scenarios and tactics</p></li><li><p>Using architecture reconstruction to recover undocumented\narchitectures</p></li><li><p>Documenting architectures using the Unified Modeling Language\n(UML)</p></li><li><p>New case studies, including Web-based examples and a wireless\nEnterprise JavaBeans™ (EJB) system designed to support\nwearable computers</p></li><li><p>The financial aspects of architectures, including use of the\nCost Benefit Analysis Method (CBAM) to make decisions</p></li><p>If you design, develop, or manage the building of large software\nsystems (or plan to do so), or if you are interested in acquiring\nsuch systems for your corporation or government agency, use\n<em><b>Software Architecture in Practice, Second Edition,</b></em> to\nget up to speed on the current state of software architecture.</p></span></span>",

Hence the text details not only modeling techniques, but design, implementation, deployment, and system adaptation -- as well as a host of other topics -- putting the elements in context and comparing and contrasting them with one another. Rather than focusing on one method, notation, tool, or process, this new text/reference widely surveys software architecture techniques, enabling the instructor and practitioner to choose the right tool for the job at hand.

    "description": "<span><div>Implement successful and cost-effective enterprise architecture projects. This book provides a new approach to developing enterprise architecture based on the idea of emergent behaviors—where instead of micromanaging system implementation, the enterprise architecture effort establishes clear goals and leaves the details to the implementation teams. System development efforts are measured based on their contribution to achieving business goals instead of implementing specific (possibly outdated) requirements.</div><div><p></p>\n\nMost enterprise architecture initiatives employ one of the existing system architecture frameworks such as Zachman or The Open Group Architecture Framework, but these are not well-suited for enterprise architecture in a modern, agile organization. The new approach presented in this book is based on the author’s experience with large enterprise architecture efforts. The approach leverages research into complex adaptive systems and emergent behaviors, where a few simple rules result in complex and efficient enterprise behaviors.<p></p>\n<p>Simplifying the task of establishing and maintaining the enterprise architecture cuts the costs of building and maintaining the architecture and frees up those resources for more productive pursuits. System implementers are given the freedom to rapidly adapt to changing user needs without the blessing of the enterprise modeling priesthood, and the architecture is transformed from a static pile of obscure models and documents into an operational framework that can be actively used to manage an enterprise’s resources to better achieve business goals. The enterprise architect is free to stop focusing on building and maintaining models and start focusing on achieving business goals.</p>\n<p><b> </b></p>\n<b>What You’ll Learn</b><p></p>\n<p></p><ul><li>Refocus enterprise architecture on business needs by eliminating most of the enterprise-level models<br/></li><li>Delegate tasks to the development teams who do system implementation<br/></li><li>Document business goals, establish strategies for achieving those goals, and measure progress toward those goals<br/></li><li>Measure the results and gauge whether the enterprise architecture is achieving its goals<br/></li><li>Utilize appropriate modeling techniques that can be effectively used in an enterprise architecture</li></ul><p></p>\n<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p>Architecture practitioners and architecture managers: Practitioners are experienced architects who have used existing frameworks such as Zachman, and have experience with formal architecture modeling and/or model-based system engineering; managers are responsible for managing an enterprise architecture project and either have experience with enterprise architecture projects that were ineffective or are looking for a different approach that will be more cost-effective and allow for more organizational agility. Government program managers looking for a different approach to make enterprise architecture more relevant and easier to implement will also find this book of value.</div></span>",

Basic knowledge of programming and serverless computing concepts are assumed.</p><b>What You Will Learn</b><ul><li>Comprehend the popular design patterns currently being used with serverless architectures</li><li>Understand the various design options and corresponding implementations for serverless web application APIs</li><li>Learn multiple patterns for data-intensive serverless systems and pipelines, including MapReduce and Lambda Architecture</li><li>Learn how to leverage hosted databases, queues, streams, storage services, and notification services</li><li>Understand error handling and system monitoring in a serverless architecture a serverless architecture</li><li>Learn how to set up a serverless application for continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment</li></ul><b>In Detail</b><p>Serverless applications handle many problems that developers face when running systems and servers. The serverless pay-per-invocation model can also result in drastic cost savings, contributing to its popularity. While it's simple to create a basic serverless application, it's critical to structure your software correctly to ensure it continues to succeed as it grows. Serverless Design Patterns and Best Practices presents patterns that can be adapted to run in a serverless environment. You will learn how to develop applications that are scalable, fault tolerant, and well-tested.</p><p>The book begins with an introduction to the different design pattern categories available for serverless applications. You will learn the trade-offs between GraphQL and REST and how they fare regarding overall application design in a serverless ecosystem. The book will also show you how to migrate an existing API to a serverless backend using AWS API Gateway. You will learn how to build event-driven applications using queuing and streaming systems, such as AWS Simple Queuing Service (SQS) and AWS Kinesis. Patterns for data-intensive serverless application are also explained, including the lambda architecture and MapReduce.</p><p>This book will equip you with the knowledge and skills you need to develop scalable and resilient serverless applications confidently.</p><b>Style and approach</b><p>Readers will be taken through a set of specific software patterns and learn, in detail, how to apply these patterns and build working software on top of a serverless system.  At each step along the way, the reader will learn about the subcomponents and subsystems which comprise the larger system and which may be used in the future to solve different types of challenges.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book You can download the example code files for all Packt books you have purchased from your account at http://www.PacktPub.com.

For the first time we are provided with a practical guide on defining service characteristics and service design principles for SOA from a vendor-agnostic viewpoint. It’s a great reference for SOA discovery, adoptions, and implementation projects.”</p><p><i>–Canyang Kevin Liu, Principal Enterprise Architect, SAP Americas, Inc.</i></p><p>“I liked this book. It contains extremely important material for those who need to design services.”</p><p><i>–Farzin Yashar, IBM SOA Advanced Technologies</i></p><p>“This book does a great job laying out benefits, key ideas and design principles behind successfully adopting service-oriented computing. At the same time, the book openly addresses challenges, risks and trade-offs that are in the way of adopting SOA in the real-world today. It moves away from ivory-tower views of service orientation, but still lays out a strong vision for SOA and outlines the changes necessary to realize the full potential.”</p><p><i>–Christoph Schittko, Senior Architect, Microsoft</i></p><p>“I recommend this book to any SOA practitioner who wishes to empower themselves in making service design real…gives readers the 360º view into service design [and] gives SOA practitioners the depth and understanding needed into the principles of SOA to assist in the design of a mature and successful SOA program.”</p><p><i>–Stephen G. Bennett, Americas SOA Practice Lead, BEA Systems</i></p><p>“SOA projects are most successful when they are based on a solid technical foundation. Well accepted and established design principles are part of this foundation. This book takes a very structured approach at defining the core design principles for SOA, thus allowing the reader to immediately applying them to a project. Each principle is formally introduced and explained, and examples are given for how to apply it to a real design problem. A ‘must read’ for any architect, designer or developer of service oriented solutions”.</p><p><i>–Andre Tost, Senior Technical Staff Member, IBM Software Group</i></p><p>“There are few references for SOA that give you the nuts and bolts and this one is at the top of the list.

Both seasoned SOA practitioners and those endeavoring to realize services can benefit from reading this book.”</p><p><i>–Bill Draven, Enterprise Architect, Intel Corporation</i></p><p>“There are very few who understand SOA like Thomas Erl does! The principle centric description of service orientation from Thomas canonizes the underpinnings of this important paradigm shift in creating agile and reusable software capabilities. The principles, so eloquently explained, leave little room for any ambiguity attached to the greater purpose of SOA. Most organizations today are creating services in a bottoms-up approach, realizing composition and reuse organically. The time is ripe for a book like this that prepares architects for a principle centric approach to SOA.”</p><p><i>–Hanu Kommalapati, Architect, Microsoft Corporation</i></p><p>“Outstanding SOA literature uniquely focused on the fundamental services design with thorough and in-depth study on all practical aspects from design principles to methodologies. This book provides a systematic approach for SOA adoption essential for both IT management and professionals.”</p><p><i>–Robin Chen, PhD, Google, Inc.</i></p><p>“Thomas Erl’s books are always densely filled with information that’s well structured. This book is especially insightful for Enterprise Architects because it provide s great context and practical examples. Part 1 of the book alone is worth getting the book for.”</p><p><i>–Markus Zirn, Senior Director, Product Management, Oracle Fusion Middleware, Oracle Corporation</i></p><p>“A very clear discussion of the subject matter. Provides a good structure that facilitates understanding and readily highlights key points.”</p><p><i>–Kareem Yusuf, Director of SOA Strategy and Planning, IBM Software Group</i></p><p>“I am very impressed. Comprehensive. Educative. This book helped me to step back and look at the SOA principles from broader perspective. I’d say this is a must-read book for SOA stakeholders.”</p><p><i>–Radovan Janecek, Director R&amp;D, SOA Center, Hewlett-Packard</i></p><p>“Very valuable guidance for understanding and applying SOA service design principles with concrete examples.

By adhering to hexagonal principles, you can structure your software in a way that reduces the effort required to understand and maintain the code.</p><p>This book starts with an in-depth analysis of hexagonal architecture's building blocks, such as entities, use cases, ports, and adapters. You'll learn how to assemble business code in the Domain hexagon, create features by using ports and use cases in the Application hexagon, and make your software compatible with different technologies by employing adapters in the Framework hexagon. Moving on, you'll get your hands dirty developing a system based on a real-world scenario applying all the hexagonal architecture's building blocks. By creating a hexagonal system, you'll also understand how you can use Java modules to reinforce dependency inversion and ensure the isolation of each hexagon in the architecture. Finally, you'll get to grips with using Quarkus to turn your hexagonal application into a cloud-native system.</p><p>By the end of this hexagonal architecture book, you'll be able to bring order and sanity to the development of complex and long-lasting applications.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Find out how to assemble business rules algorithms using the specification design pattern</li><li>Combine domain-driven design techniques with hexagonal principles to create powerful domain models</li><li>Employ adapters to make the system support different protocols such as REST, gRPC, and WebSocket</li><li>Create a module and package structure based on hexagonal principles</li><li>Use Java modules to enforce dependency inversion and ensure isolation between software components</li><li>Implement Quarkus DI to manage the life cycle of input and output ports</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book is for software architects and Java developers who want to improve code maintainability and enhance productivity with an architecture that allows changes in technology without compromising business logic, which is precisely what hexagonal architecture does. Intermediate knowledge of the Java programming language and familiarity with Jakarta EE will help you to get the most out of this book.</p></span>",

This is difficult but crucial: Failure to achieve this\nbalance often leads directly to poor systems design and\nimplementation. Now, pioneering IBM Distinguished Engineer and\nChief Technology Officer Tilak Mitra offers the first complete\nguide to developing end-to-end solution architectures that are\n“just enough”--identifying and capturing the most\nimportant artifacts, without over-engineering or excessive\ndocumentation, and providing a practical approach to consistent and\nrepeated success in defining software architectures.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Practical Software Architecture</em> provides detailed\nprescriptive and pragmatic guidance for architecting any real-world\nIT project, regardless of system, methodology, or environment.\nMitra specifically identifies the artifacts that require emphasis\nand shows how to communicate evolving solutions with stakeholders,\nbridging the gap between architecture and implementation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThrough a real-world case study, Mitra guides you iteratively\nthrough building an end-to-end solution architecture. Step by step,\nhe addresses key topics in developing system contexts, architecture\noverviews, architecture decisions, functional models, operational\nmodels, integration patterns for systems design, infrastructure\nmatters, and more. Throughout, you’ll find clear, crisp, and\naccurate guidance for crafting architectures that can be\nconfidently delivered on time and budget.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Coverage Includes</b><br/></p><li><p>Using architecture to promote communication, enable planning,\nand support functional as well as nonfunctional capabilities (such\nas scalability, performance, maintainability, and security)</p></li><li><p>Focusing on the architectural problem at hand and avoiding\noverreliance on theory and generalization</p></li><li><p>An architectural introduction to analytics</p></li><li><p>Capturing “just enough” about system context,\narchitecture overview, architecture decisions, functional models,\nand operational models</p></li><li><p>Integration patterns and their usage in architecture\ndesign</p></li><li><p>Infrastructure matters in any software architecture</p></li><li><p>A real-world case study and its software architecture</p></li></span></span>",

He\npassionately believes that one hour spent with an end user is worth\nmany hours making software architectural choices or days\ndocumenting perceived user requirements. Most of what is written\nabout software development focuses on methods used to design and\ndevelop robust software. Luke’s latest effort, <em>Beyond\nSoftware Architecture</em>, illuminates the more mundane aspects of\ncreating true business solutions by supporting the user throughout\nthe lifecycle of the software product. By concerning himself with\ncreating business value, Luke tightens the connection between a\nsoftware application and the business function it\nperforms.”</p><p>\n         &amp;#8212<b>Bruce\nBourbon</b><br/>\n             General\nPartner, Telos Venture Partners</p><p>“There are two kinds of people that read the Dilbert comic\nstrip: folks that take a moment to marvel at how accurately it\nreflects life at their company before moving on to the next comic\nstrip, and folks that think Dilbert is an amusing reminder that\nhigh tech companies can and should be better than Dilbert’s\nworld. Anyone in the first group should stick to reading comics.\nThis book is for people in the latter group.”</p><p>\n         —<b>Tony\nNavarrete</b><br/>\n             Vice\nPresident, Diamondhead Ventures</p><p>“Luke brings a proven methodology to the challenge of\nsoftware development. In <em>Beyond Software Architecture</em>, Luke\nprovides practical and proven techniques that all development\nexecutives can employ to improve the productivity of their software\norganization.”</p><p>\n         —<b>G.\nBradford Solso</b><br/>\n             CEO,\nTaviz Technology</p><p>“<em>Beyond Software Architecture</em> is the first book I\nhave read which contains an insider’s perspective of both the\nbusiness and technical facets of software architecture.

Technical architectures have profound business ramifications,\nand ignoring the business ramifications of portability, usability,\nconfiguration, upgrade and release management, security, and other\narchitectural choices can not only lead to project failures, but\nultimately to nasty lawsuits from disappointed customers. <em>Beyond\nSoftware Architecture</em> is a must-read for successful software\nproduct managers!”</p><p>\n         &amp;#8212<b>Ed\nYourdon</b><br/>\n             Author\nof numerous books and articles on software development</p><p>“<em>Beyond Software Architecture</em> is not just for\nsoftware engineering professionals! Executives and product managers\nwill find that the book provides the necessary background to make\ninformed decisions about the software that their companies build. I\nhave found that the book is a useful tool for building consensus\nbetween management and engineering, because it discusses business\nand customer-related issues without delving too deeply into\nimplementation details.”</p><p>\n         &amp;#8212<b>David\nChaiken</b><br/>\n             Vice\nPresident, Systems Architecture<br/>\n             AgileTV\nCorporation</p><p>“Product marketing influences product architecture. This\nshouldn’t be a surprise, yet most texts on software\narchitecture are silent on this fact. This may be because we lack\nthe language for distinguishing between the technical aspects of an\narchitecture and the marketing aspects. <em>Beyond Software\nArchitecture</em> provides the language to draw this important\ndistinction, and provides strategies for overall architectural\nsuccess.”</p><p>\n         &amp;#8212<b>Dave\nW. Smith</b></p><p>“<em>Beyond Software Architecture</em>, as the title\nimplies, successfully addresses the often neglected aspects of\ndeveloping total solutions. Hohmann demonstrates both passion and\ndepth for the broad set of topics discussed.”</p><p>\n         &amp;#8212<b>Craig\nPriess</b><br/>\n             Director\nProduct Management, Resonant Software</p><p>“Looking through my technical library, it’s apparent\nthat many books are obsolete, casualties of technical innovation\nand change. There are a few, however, that remain and continue to\nbe relevant. Adding Luke Hohmann’s new book, <em>Beyond\nSoftware Architecture: Creating and Sustaining Winning\nSolutions</em> expands that selection and fills an important gap.

    "title": "Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture, Volume 1, A System of Patterns",
    "description": "<span><span><span><p>Pattern - Oriented Software Architecture A System of Patterns Frank Buschmann, Regine Meunier, Hans Rohnert, Peter Sommerlad, Michael Stal of Siemens AG, Germany Pattern-oriented software architecture is a new approach to software development. This book represents the progression and evolution of the pattern approach into a system of patterns capable of describing and documenting large-scale applications. A pattern system provides, on one level, a pool of proven solutions to many recurring design problems. On another it shows how to combine individual patterns into heterogeneous structures and as such it can be used to facilitate a constructive development of software systems. Uniquely, the patterns that are presented in this book span several levels of abstraction, from high-level architectural patterns and medium-level design patterns to low-level idioms. The intention of, and motivation for, this book is to support both novices and experts in software development. Novices will gain from the experience inherent in pattern descriptions and experts will hopefully make use of, add to, extend and modify patterns to tailor them to their own needs. None of the pattern descriptions are cast in stone and, just as they are borne from experience, it is expected that further use will feed in and refine individual patterns and produce an evolving system of patterns.

    "description": "<span><p>Ever-changing business needs have prompted large companies to rethink their enterprise IT. Today, businesses must allow interaction with their customers, partners, and employees at more touch points and at a depth never thought previously. At the same time, rapid advances in information technologies, like business digitization, cloud computing, and Web 2.0, demand fundamental changes in the enterprises’ management practices. These changes have a drastic effect not only on IT and business, but also on policies, processes, and people. Many companies therefore embark on enterprise-wide transformation initiatives. The role of Enterprise Architecture (EA) is to architect and supervise this transformational journey.  Unfortunately, today’s EA is often a ponderous and detached exercise, with most of the EA initiatives failing to create visible impact. The enterprises need an EA that is agile and responsive to business dynamics. <i>Collaborative Enterprise Architecture</i> provides the innovative solutions today’s enterprises require, informed by real-world experiences and experts’ insights.   This book, in its first part, provides a systematic compendium of the current best practices in EA, analyzes current ways of doing EA, and identifies its constraints and shortcomings. In the second part, it leaves the beaten tracks of EA by introducing Lean, Agile, and Enterprise 2.0 concepts to the traditional EA methods. This blended approach to EA focuses on practical aspects, with recommendations derived from real-world experiences.   A truly thought provoking and pragmatic guide to manage EA, <i>Collaborative Enterprise Architecture</i> effectively merges the long-term oriented top-down approach with pragmatic bottom-up thinking, and that way offers real solutions to businesses undergoing enterprise-wide change. </p><ul><li>Covers the latest emerging technologies affecting business practice, including digitization, cloud computing, agile software development, and Web 2.0 </li><li>Focuses on the practical implementation of EAM rather than theory, with recommendations based on real-world case studies </li><li>Addresses changing business demands and practices, including Enterprise 2.0, open source, global sourcing, and more </li><li>Takes an innovative approach to EAM, merging standard top-down and pragmatic, bottom-up strategies, offering real solutions to businesses undergoing enterprise-wide changes </li></ul></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>Software architecture is a young and curious discipline. While analogizing software architecture with building architecture and city planning can be useful, it can also be misleading. Physical structures benefit from up-front design to guide their development, but software systems have a more dynamic nature that requires additional foresight. Systems thinking is a maturing field that examines the structure and behavior of complex systems, how they develop, and how they may be influenced (but never controlled).</p><p>Matt McLarty (MuleSoft) explores how systems thinking can be applied to software architecture. You’ll gain an introduction to systems thinking concepts and axioms, such as the iceberg model, the bathtub theorem, stock and flow diagrams, and more; an analysis of enterprise software ecosystems from a systems thinking perspective; and systems thinking–inspired techniques software architects can use when designing or evolving these software ecosystems through the use of microservice architecture and APIs.</p></div></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>Most software engineers come up through the ranks as coders and believe that the valuable lessons they’ve learned from their years in the trenches are an infallible guide to the future. While experience is certainly useful, the emerging field of cognitive psychology has another story to tell: the real reasons for our decisions aren’t entirely the subject of our conscious choice—or even awareness.</p><p>Ian Varley (Salesforce) covers the emerging field of cognitive biases—bugs in our mental operating system—and takes a cold, hard look at how these mental blind spots defeat our attempts to build quality software in every domain. (If you’ve read books like <i>Thinking Fast and Slow</i> and <i>You Are Not So Smart</i>, you’ll be familiar with the basic idea.)</p><p>While awareness of cognitive biases is a good life skill in general, it’s particularly critical if you’re in a software architect role, because your opinions set the conditions for massive amounts of work by other engineers. As such, it’s worth the time to thoroughly debug your own process for learning and making important decisions. Ian explains why the sunk cost fallacy means you’re not throwing things out fast enough; how confirmation bias can sneak into even the most data-driven decisions; how hindsight bias is obscuring the real lessons you might have learned from that failed project; how priming and fixation is shooting down your most promising inputs; and how arguing over architectural decisions is unlikely to help anybody. (See also: “Nobody ever changed their mind between Vim and Emacs.”)</p><p>Most importantly, Ian shares concrete techniques you can use to check your own decision making for these unwelcome guests. We might not be capable of being perfectly rational beings, but we can be a lot less dumb.</p><p>This session was recorded at the 2019 O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference in San Jose.</p></div></span></span>",

It will grow, evolve, and wake you up in the middle of the night. Usually, at this point you start thinking about fault tolerance and error handling. Fault-tolerance concepts sound simple: modern frameworks promise to effortlessly solve it for you.</p><p>But what’s hiding behind the simplicity? Alex Borysov (Google) and Mykyta Protsenko (Netflix) take you along for a sneak peak at how to design and build truly fault-tolerant Java systems. They make it real by trying failure scenarios against a live system (you’ll watch it recover in real time) and then review the recipes (with gRPC and REST examples and a number of open source tools) that you can use right away to make your code more resilient and your system more robust.</p><p><b>Prerequisite knowledge</b></p><ul><li>A basic understanding of microservice architecture</li></ul><p>This session was recorded at the 2019 O'Reilly Open Source Software conference in Portland.</p></div></span></span>",

Modern software has become complex and adaptable due to the emergence of globalization and new software technologies, devices and networks. These changes challenge both traditional software quality assurance techniques and software engineers to ensure software quality when building today (and tomorrow’s) adaptive, context-sensitive, and highly diverse applications. </p><p>This edited volume presents state of the art techniques, methodologies, tools, best practices and guidelines for software quality assurance and offers guidance for future software engineering research and practice. Each contributed chapter considers the practical application of the topic through case studies, experiments, empirical validation, or systematic comparisons with other approaches already in practice. Topics of interest include, but are not limited, to: quality attributes of system/software architectures; aligning enterprise, system, and software architecture from the point of view of total quality; design decisions and their influence on the quality of system/software architecture; methods and processes for evaluating architecture quality; quality assessment of legacy systems and third party applications; lessons learned and empirical validation of theories and frameworks on architectural quality; empirical validation and testing for assessing architecture quality.</p><ul><li>Focused on quality assurance at all levels of software design and development</li><li>Covers domain-specific software quality assurance issues e.g. for cloud, mobile, security, context-sensitive, mash-up and autonomic systems</li><li>Explains likely trade-offs from design decisions in the context of complex software system engineering and quality assurance</li><li>Includes practical case studies of software quality assurance for complex, adaptive and context-critical systems</li></ul></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>For software to consistently deliver promised results, software\ndevelopment must mature into a true profession. <em>Emergent\nDesign</em> points the way. As software continues to evolve and\nmature, software development processes become more complicated,\nrelying on a variety of methodologies and approaches. This book\nilluminates the path to building the next generation of software.\nAuthor Scott L. Bain integrates the best of today’s most\nimportant development disciplines into a unified, streamlined,\nrealistic, and fully actionable approach to developing software.\nDrawing on patterns, refactoring, and test-driven development, Bain\noffers a blueprint for moving efficiently through the entire\nsoftware lifecycle, smoothly managing change, and consistently\ndelivering systems that are robust, reliable, and\ncost-effective.</p><p>Reflecting a deep understanding of the natural flow of system\ndevelopment, <em>Emergent Design</em> helps developers work with the\nflow, instead of against it. Bain introduces the principles and\npractices of emergent design one step at a time, showing how to\npromote the natural evolution of software systems over time, making\nsystems work better and provide greater value. To illuminate his\napproach, Bain presents code examples wherever necessary and\nconcludes with a complete project case study.</p><p>This book provides developers, project leads, and testers\npowerful new ways to collaborate, achieve immediate goals, and\nbuild systems that improve in quality with each iteration.</p><p>Coverage includes</p><li><p>How to design software in a more natural, evolutionary, and\nprofessional way</p></li><li><p>How to use the “open-closed” principle to mitigate\nrisks and eliminate waste</p></li><li><p>How and when to test your design throughout the development\nprocess</p></li><li><p>How to translate design principles into practices that actually\nlead to better code</p></li><li><p>How to determine how much design is enough</p></li><li><p>How refactoring can help you reduce over-design and manage\nchange more effectively</p></li><p>The book’s companion Web site, www.netobjectives.com/resources,\nprovides updates, links to related materials, and support for\ndiscussions of the book’s content.</p></span></span>",

Python Object-Oriented Programming, Fourth Edition dives deep into the various aspects of OOP, Python as an OOP language, common and advanced design patterns, and hands-on data manipulation and testing of more complex OOP systems. These concepts are consolidated by open-ended exercises, as well as a real-world case study at the end of every chapter, newly written for this edition. All example code is now compatible with Python 3.9+ syntax and has been updated with type hints for ease of learning.</p><p>Steven and Dusty provide a comprehensive, illustrative tour of important OOP concepts, such as inheritance, composition, and polymorphism, and explain how they work together with Python's classes and data structures to facilitate good design. In addition, the book also features an in-depth look at Python's exception handling and how functional programming intersects with OOP. Two very powerful automated testing systems, unittest and pytest, are introduced. The final chapter provides a detailed discussion of Python's concurrent programming ecosystem.</p><p>By the end of the book, you will have a thorough understanding of how to think about and apply object-oriented principles using Python syntax and be able to confidently create robust and reliable programs.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Implement objects in Python by creating classes and defining methods</li><li>Extend class functionality using inheritance</li><li>Use exceptions to handle unusual situations cleanly</li><li>Understand when to use object-oriented features, and more importantly, when not to use them</li><li>Discover several widely used design patterns and how they are implemented in Python</li><li>Uncover the simplicity of unit and integration testing and understand why they are so important</li><li>Learn to statically type check your dynamic code</li><li>Understand concurrency with asyncio and how it speeds up programs</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>If you are new to object-oriented programming techniques, or if you have basic Python skills and wish to learn how and when to correctly apply OOP principles in Python, this is the book for you. Moreover, if you are an object-oriented programmer coming from other languages or seeking a leg up in the new world of Python, you will find this book a useful introduction to Python.

This text provides a careful, in depth, non-engineering introduction to the inner workings of modern computer systems.</p><p>Overall, the 5th edition pays more attention to the variety of computer devices available today, including smartphones and tablets, while continuing to emphasize the basic principles of computer architecture, and the similarities of all of these devices.  It has been the author's continuing position that the basic principles in the design of computer technology have not changed in many years; that the so-called new designs are changes in implementation and application rather than concept.</p></span></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>The schism between the functional and object-oriented programmers is really a false binary. Yes, the first group argues that FP is superior for a multicore world, while the second insists that OOP is better at matching technical solutions to business problems. However, as this O’Reilly report explains, this is not an either-or proposition.</p><p>Technologist Richard Warburton, author of Java 8 Lambas, discusses similarities between these programming paradigms and points out that both FP and OOP are actually moving closer toward one another. One prominent example is the use of lambda expressions in Java and other OOP languages such as C#, C++, and Swift.</p><p>By following examples written in Java, you will:</p><ul><li>Learn how lambdas (aka anonymous functions) make OOP languages better suited for dealing with parallelism and concurrency</li><li>Understand how SOLID—OOP’s five basic principles of programming—map to functional languages and paradigms</li><li>Explore some of the most common OOP design patterns—and how they exist in the functional world</li></ul></div></span>",

Using JavaScript, you can create interactive web pages along with desktop widgets, browser, and application extensions, and other pieces of software. Object-oriented programming, which is popularly known as OOP, is basically based on the concept of objects rather than actions. </p><p>The first module will help you master JavaScript and build futuristic web applications. You will start by getting acquainted with the language constructs and how to organize code easily. You develop concrete understanding of variable scoping, loops, and best practices on using types and data structures, as well as the coding style and recommended code organization patterns in JavaScript. The book will also teach you how to use arrays and objects as data structures. By the end of the book, you will understand how reactive JavaScript is going to be the new paradigm.</p><p>The second module is an easy-to-follow course, which includes hands-on examples of solutions to common problems with object-oriented code. It will help to identify objects from real-life scenarios, to protect and hide data with the data encapsulation features of Python, JavaScript, and C#. You will discover the advantage of duck typing in both Python and JavaScript, while you work with interfaces and generics in C#. With a fair understanding of interfaces, multiple inheritance, and composition, you will move on to refactor existing code and to organize your source for easy maintenance and extension.</p><p>The third module takes you through all the in-depth and exciting futures hidden behind the facade. You should read through this course if you want to be able to take your JavaScript skills to a new level of sophistication.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This course is a comprehensive guide where each chapter consists of best practices, constructive advice, and few easy-to-follow examples that will build up your skills as you advance through the book. Get object oriented with this course, which takes you on a journey to get acquainted with few useful hands-on tools, features, and ways to enhance your productivity using OOP techniques. The practice questions at the end of each chapter will help you to review what you have understood. It will also act as a reference guide with useful examples on resolving problems with object-oriented code in Python, JavaScript, and C#.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><div><p>Architects are leaders. We need to understand our business, our users, and our ecosystem. We need to effectively interact with our stakeholders, productively collaborate with design and product teams, and give direction and motivate our development teams. Achieving these goals requires much more than technical excellence.</p><p>Drawing on material he’s used to train team members ranging from developers and designers to executives, Seth Dobbs (Bounteous) offers a primer on leadership for architects, focusing on guiding principles that are easy to learn and put into practice. Principles will cover both inward focus (personal mastery) and external focus (effective interactions) and will include topics such as vision, problem solving, ownership, and conflict. Seth introduces each principle first with a problem or anti-pattern, discusses the principle, and then details examples of the principle in practice. Whether you’re new in a leadership role looking to understand the “soft” skills required or have been leading for a while and want to formalize your thinking on leadership, this session is for you.</p></div></span></span></span>",

Contributions from leading researchers and industry evangelists detail the techniques required to achieve quality management in software architecting, and the best way to apply these techniques effectively in various application domains (especially in cloud, mobile and ultra-large-scale/internet-scale architecture) Taken together, these approaches show how to assess the value of total quality management in a software development process, with an emphasis on architecture.</p><p>The book explains how to improve system quality with focus on attributes such as usability, maintainability, flexibility, reliability, reusability, agility, interoperability, performance, and more. It discusses the importance of clear requirements, describes patterns and tradeoffs that can influence quality, and metrics for quality assessment and overall system analysis. The last section of the book leverages practical experience and evidence to look ahead at the challenges faced by organizations in capturing and realizing quality requirements, and explores the basis of future work in this area.</p><ul><li>Explains how design decisions and method selection influence overall system quality, and lessons learned from theories and frameworks on architectural quality</li><li>Shows how to align enterprise, system, and software architecture for total quality</li><li>Includes case studies, experiments, empirical validation, and systematic comparisons with other approaches already in practice.</li></ul></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><i>Economics-driven Software Architecture</i> presents a guide for engineers and architects who need to understand the economic impact of architecture design decisions: the long term and strategic viability, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability of applications and systems. Economics-driven software development can increase quality, productivity, and profitability, but comprehensive knowledge is needed to understand the architectural challenges involved in dealing with the development of large, architecturally challenging systems in an economic way.</p><p>This book covers how to apply economic considerations during the software architecting activities of a project. Architecture-centric approaches to development and systematic evolution, where managing complexity, cost reduction, risk mitigation, evolvability, strategic planning and long-term value creation are among the major drivers for adopting such approaches. It assists the objective assessment of the lifetime costs and benefits of evolving systems, and the identification of legacy situations, where architecture or a component is indispensable but can no longer be evolved to meet changing needs at economic cost. Such consideration will form the scientific foundation for reasoning about the economics of nonfunctional requirements in the context of architectures and architecting.</p><ul><li>Familiarizes readers with essential considerations in economic-informed and value-driven software design and analysis </li><li>Introduces techniques for making value-based software architecting decisions</li><li>Provides readers a better understanding of the methods of economics-driven architecting</li></ul></span>",

However, in this melee, many enterprises often neglect to invest in architects by presuming architecture is not an intrinsic element of Agile software development.</p><p>Since the role of an architect is not pre-defined in Agile, many organizations struggle to position architects, often resulting in friction with other roles or a failure to provide a clear learning path for architects to be productive.</p><p>This book guides architects and organizations through new Agile ways of incrementally developing the architecture for delivering an uninterrupted, continuous flow of values that meets customer needs. You'll explore various aspects of Agile architecture and how it differs from traditional architecture. The book later covers Agile architects' responsibilities and how architects can add significant value by positioning themselves appropriately in the Agile flow of work. Through examples, you'll also learn concepts such as architectural decision backlog,the last responsible moment, value delivery, architecting for change, DevOps, and evolutionary collaboration.</p><p>By the end of this Agile book, you'll be able to operate as an architect in Agile development initiatives and successfully architect reliable software systems.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Acquire clarity on the duties of architects in Agile development</li><li>Understand architectural styles such as domain-driven design and microservices</li><li>Identify the pitfalls of traditional architecture and learn how to develop solutions</li><li>Understand the principles of value and data-driven architecture</li><li>Discover DevOps and continuous delivery from an architect's perspective</li><li>Adopt Lean-Agile documentation and governance</li><li>Develop a set of personal and interpersonal qualities</li><li>Find out how to lead the transformation to achieve organization-wide agility</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This agile study guide is for architects currently working on agile development projects or aspiring to work on agile software delivery, irrespective of the methodology they are using. You will also find this book useful if you're a senior developer or a budding architect looking to understand an agile architect's role by embracing agile architecture strategies and a lean-agile mindset. To understand the concepts covered in this book easily, you need to have prior knowledge of basic agile development practices.</p></span>",

Biogeography-based optimization (BBO) is an optimization algorithm that is based on the science of biogeography, which researches the migration patterns of species. These migration paradigms provide the main logic behind BBO. Due to the cross-disciplinary nature of the optimization problems, there is a need to develop multiple approaches to tackle them and to study the theoretical reasoning behind their performance. This manuscript intends to explain the mathematical model of BBO algorithm and its variants created to cope with continuous domain problems (with and without constraints) and combinatorial problems.</p><p>Due to the cross-disciplinary nature of the optimization problems, there is a need to develop multiple approaches to tackle them and to study the theoretical reasoning behind their performance.

    "description": "<span><p>Many software projects fail because their leaders don't know how\nto estimate, schedule, or measure them accurately. Fortunately,\nproven tools and techniques exist for every facet of software\nestimation. Estimating Software-Intensive Systems brings them\ntogether in a real-world guidebook that will help software\nmanagers, engineers, and customers immediately improve their\nestimates—and drive continuing improvements over time.</p><p>Dick Stutzke presents here a disciplined and repeatable process\nthat can produce accurate and complete</p><p>estimates for any project, product, or process, no matter how\nnew or unusual. Stutzke doesn't just describe formal techniques: He\noffers simple, easy-to-use templates, spreadsheets, and tools you\ncan start using today to identify and estimate product size,\nperformance, and quality—as well as project cost, schedule,\nand risk reserves.</p><p>Stutzke shows how to quickly \"get your arms around\" users'\nproblems and requirements, the structure of a solution, and the\nprocess needed to deliver it. You'll learn how to choose the most\nappropriate estimating techniques and tools; collect accurate data,\ntrack progress, and update estimates; and recalibrate estimating\nmodels to improve estimation accuracy.</p><p>Stutzke's techniques apply whether you're creating custom\nin-house business software, purchasing or customizing\n\"off-the-shelf\" technology, or constructing complex, one-of-a-kind\nmilitary, industrial, or commercial systems. These techniques apply\nto small and large projects, and to all project life\ncycles—from agile to plan-driven. This book will help you\nplan, estimate, budget, schedule, purchase, design, build, test,\ndeploy, operate, and maintain software-intensive systems. It\nexplains how to size software, identify all cost components,\ncalculate the associated costs, and set a competitive price.</p><p>A separate section covers topics of interest for large projects:\ndesigning an appropriate work breakdown structure, collecting data\nfrom cost accounting systems, and using earned value\nmeasurement.</p><p>An accompanying CD-ROM contains templates, supplemental notes,\nand Microsoft Excel spreadsheets to estimate and track projects,\nproduct characteristics, and processes. It contains an extensive\nbibliography and links to web resources on software estimation,\nmeasurement, and related topics. You'll find updates and even more\ninformation on this book's companion web site, http://www.sw-estimation.com.</p><p>© Copyright Pearson Education. All rights reserved.</p></span>",

Within\nUML, OCL is the standard for specifying expressions that add vital\ninformation to object-oriented models and other object-modeling\nartifacts. Model Driven Architecture (MDA) relies on OCL to add the\nlevel of programming detail necessary to enable platform-specific\nmodels (PSM) to communicate with platform-independent models\n(PIM).</p><p>This book is a practical, accessible guide to OCL for software\narchitects, designers, and developers. Much care has been taken\nduring the redesign of OCL to ensure that the syntax remains\nreadable and writable by the average software modeler. <b><em>The\nObject Constraint Language, Second Edition</em></b>, utilizes a case\nstudy to show how to exercise these compact but powerful\nexpressions for maximum effect.</p><p>This newly updated edition</p><ul><li><p>Explains why OCL is critical to MDA--and why UML alone is not\nenough</p></li><li><p>Introduces an SQL-like syntax to OCL</p></li><li><p>Defines the new language constructs of OCL 2.0</p></li><li><p>Demonstrates how OCL can be incorporated into code</p></li><li><p>Shares tips and tricks for applying OCL to real-world modeling\nchallenges—showing which can be solved with UML and which\nrequire OCL</p></li></ul><p>Using a combination of UML and OCL allows developers to realize\nthe effective, consistent, and coherent models that are critical to\nworking with MDA.

    "description": "<span><p>Use cases have become an integral part of modeling software\nrequirements, but many software developers are discovering that\nwriting effective use cases is more difficult than they had\nanticipated. An understanding of the basic principles of use cases\nis not enough. Software developers need a source of objective\ncriteria by which to judge quality and effectiveness.</p><p><em><b>Patterns for Effective Use Cases</b></em> provides this set\nof objective criteria. Written by experienced use case\npractitioners, this book fills a critical information gap by\npresenting a pattern language that contains over thirty patterns,\nproviding simple, elegant, and proven solutions to the most common\nproblems in use case development. These patterns distill and define\nthe properties and characteristics of quality use cases. As such,\nthey facilitate the development of original use cases and provide a\ndiagnostic tool for evaluating existing ones.</p><p>The book opens with a review of use cases and pattern\nfundamentals, along with a discussion of the requirements-gathering\nteam. These patterns address the use case development process, the\ninternal structure of use cases, and the relationships among use\ncases within the system as a whole. Examples of patterns\ninclude:</p><ul><li><p>BreadthBeforeDepth</p></li><li><p>VisibleBoundary</p></li><li><p>EverUnfoldingStory</p></li><li><p>IntentionRevealingName</p></li><li><p>PreciseAndReadable</p></li><li><p>LeveledSteps</p></li><li><p>InterruptsAsExtensions</p></li><li><p>RedistributeTheWealth</p></li></ul><p>Each pattern discussion includes at least one example\ndemonstrating its real-world application, highlighting both the\nbenefits of using the pattern and the consequences of not doing so.\nIn addition, the book presents guidelines for the effective use of\nUML with relevant patterns.</p><p>Anyone involved in use case writing or requirements gathering\nwill find <b><em>Patterns for Effective Use Cases</em></b> an\nindispensable handbook and reference.</p><p><br/><br/>\n0201721848B07302002</p></span>",

The\nauthors have used their wealth of experience to produce an\nexcellent and insightful collection of detailed examples,\nexplanations, and advice on how to work with use cases.\"</em></p><p>–Maria Ericsson</p><p>The toughest challenge in building a software system that meets\nthe needs of your audience lies in clearly understanding the\nproblems that the system must solve. <em>Advanced Use Case\nModeling</em> presents a framework for discovering, identifying, and\nmodeling the problem that the software system will ultimately\nsolve.</p><p>Software developers often employ use cases to specify what\nshould be performed by the system they're constructing. Although\nuse case-driven analysis, design, and testing of software systems\nhas become increasingly popular, little has been written on the\nrole of use cases in the complete software cycle. This book fills\nthat need by describing how to create use case models for complex\nsoftware development projects, using practical examples to explain\nconceptual information.</p><p>The authors extend the work of software visionary Ivar Jacobson,\nusing the Unified Modeling Language (UML) as the notation to\ndescribe the book's models. Aimed primarily at software\nprofessionals, <em>Advanced Use Case Modeling</em> also includes\ninformation that relates use case technique to business\nprocesses.</p><p>This book presents a process for creating and maintaining use\ncase models in a framework that can be fully customized for your\norganization. The authors, pioneers in the application of use cases\nin software development, bring their extensive experience to cover\ntopics such as:</p><li><p>A process model for applying a use case model</p></li><li><p>How to keep your use case modeling effort on track</p></li><li><p>Tips and pitfalls in use case modeling</p></li><li><p>How to organize your use case model for large-system\ndevelopment</p></li><li><p>Similarities between Advanced Use Case Modeling and the\nRational Unified Process framework</p></li><li><p>Effect of use cases on user interface design</p></li><li><p>Guidelines for quality use case modeling</p></li></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><strong>Over 90 Minutes of Video Instruction</strong></p><p><strong>Description</strong><br/>\n\nBeing data-driven is a hot phrase, but what does it mean in practice? As the tide of digitization rises, every industry sector is poised to be transformed: digital manufacture such as 3D printing has commoditized prototyping and product development; mobile apps have put every business in direct contact with their customers; and the Internet of Things promises the ability to manipulate processes and environment. The result of this digitization is an unprecedented flood of data.</p><p>The ability to make decisions based on this data, and to use it to experiment rapidly, has become an imperative for today’s companies who wish to play a part in tomorrow’s market. An \"experimental enterprise\" is a company whose infrastructure is designed to make experimentation possible and efficient. It is not about finding analytical fairy dust that you can sprinkle to make everything better, but rather a deep-rooted approach to operations, innovation, and competition.</p><p>Although digitization is unquestionably an issue for the entire company, it places a laser focus on the IT organization. In a digitized marketplace, IT must transform from being \"faster paper\" to one in which it underpins strategic advantage. This is not an incremental change, but a radical reassessment. Within IT, there are six critical building blocks that can be used to build an experimental enterprise: the cloud, devops, and open source; agile development and platforms; and data science. This video introduces each of these building blocks in turn, and explains how the audience can use them in their own organizations to adapt and thrive under challenging and rapidly changing market conditions.</p><p>\n</p><p><strong>About the Presenters</strong><br/></p><p><strong>John Akred, CTO</strong><br/>\n\nWith over 15 years in advanced analytical applications and architecture, John is dedicated to helping organizations become more data-driven.

    "title": "The Art of Immutable Architecture: Theory and Practice of Data Management in Distributed Systems",
    "description": "<span><div>This book teaches you how to evaluate a distributed system from the perspective of immutable objects. You will understand the problems in existing designs, know how to make small modifications to correct those problems, and learn to apply the principles of immutable architecture to your tools.<br/></div><div><br/></div>Most software components focus on the state of objects. They store the current state of a row in a relational database. They track changes to state over time, making several basic assumptions: there is a single latest version of each object, the state of an object changes sequentially, and a system of record exists.<div><br/></div><div>This is a challenge when it comes to building distributed systems. Whether dealing with autonomous microservices or disconnected mobile apps, many of the problems we try to solve come down to synchronizing an ever-changing state between isolated components. Distributed systems would be a lot easier to build if objects could not change.</div><div><br/></div><div>After reading <b><i>The Art of Immutable Architecture</i></b>, you will come away with an understanding of the benefits of using immutable objects in your own distributed systems. You will learn a set of rules for identifying and exchanging immutable objects, and see a collection of useful theorems that emerges and ensures that the distributed systems we build are eventually consistent. Using patterns, you will find where the truth converges, see how changes are associative, rather than sequential, and come to feel comfortable understanding that there is no longer a single source of truth. Practical hands-on examples reinforce how to build software using the described patterns, techniques, and tools. By the end, you will possess the language and resources needed to analyze and construct distributed systems with confidence.<br/></div><div><br/></div> The assumptions of the past were sufficient for building single-user, single-computer systems. But as we expand to multiple devices, shared experiences, and cloud computing, they work against us. It is time for a new set of assumptions. Start with immutable objects, and build better distributed systems.<br/><p></p><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><b>What You Will Learn</b></div><div><ul><li>Evaluate a distributed system from the perspective of      immutable objects </li><li>Recognize the problems in existing designs, and make small      modifications to correct them</li><li>Start a new system from scratch, applying patterns</li>  Apply the principles of immutable architecture to your      tools, including SQL databases, message queues, and the network protocols      that you already use   <li>Discover new tools that natively apply these      principles </li> </ul></div><div><br/></div><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b></div><div><br/></div><div>Software architects and senior developers.

    "title": "Introducing Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr): Simplifying Microservices Applications Development Through Proven and Reusable Patterns and Practices",
    "description": "<span><div>Use this book to learn the Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr), a new event-driven runtime from Microsoft designed to help developers build microservices applications, using a palette of languages and frameworks that run everywhere: on-premises, in any cloud, and even on the edge.<br/><p></p><b></b><p>One of the most popular architectural patterns for implementing large, complex, distributed solutions is the microservices architectural style. Because solutions are composed of services based on various languages, frameworks, and platforms, the more complex and compartmentalized an application becomes, the more considerations a developer has to keep in mind. Much of the time this proves to be difficult.<br/></p><b><i>Introducing </i></b><b><i>Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr)</i></b> is your guide to achieving more with less through patterns. Part I of the book is about understanding microservices and getting up and running with Dapr, either on your machine or in <i>any </i>Kubernetes cluster. From there you are guided through the concepts of Dapr, how it works, and what it can do for you. You will wrap up with various ways to debug Dapr applications using Visual Studio Code locally, inside a container or Kubernetes. In Part II you will jump into the reusable patterns and practices, the building blocks of Dapr. You will go from service invocation, publish and subscribe, state management, resource bindings, and the Actor model to secrets; each building block is covered in detail in its own dedicated chapter. You will learn what Dapr offers from a functional perspective and also how you can leverage the three pillars of observability (logs, metrics, and traces) in order to gain insight into your applications. In Part III you will explore advanced concepts, including using middleware pipelines, integrating Dapr into web frameworks such as ASP.NET Core, or the runtimes of Azure Logic Apps and Azure Functions.<p></p>\n<p>The book features a multi-versed set of examples that cover not only the plain API of Dapr, but also the .NET SDK. Hence, most of the examples are in .NET 5, with a small number in JavaScript to exemplify the use of multiple languages. Examples show you how to securely use Dapr to leverage a variety of services in Microsoft Azure, including Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Storage, Azure Service Bus, Azure Event Grid, Azure Key Vault, Azure Monitor, and Azure Active Directory among others.<br/></p>\n<p><br/></p></div><div><b>What You Will Learn</b></div><div><ul><li>Recognize the challenges and boundaries of microservices architecture</li><li>Host Dapr inside a Kubernetes cluster or as a standalone process<br/></li><li>Leverage and use Dapr’s ready-to-use patterns and practices</li><li>Utilize its HTTP/gRPC APIs</li><li>Use Dapr with ASP.NET Core and in .NET applications (with or without the SDK)</li><li>Implement observability for Dapr applications</li><li>Secure Dapr applications</li><li>Integrate Dapr with the runtime of Azure Logic Apps and Azure Functions</li><li>Realize the full potential of Visual Studio Code by using the right extensions that will contribute to a better development experience</li></ul></div><div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b></div><div><br/></div><div>Developers and architects who want to utilize a proven set of patterns to help easily implement microservices applications</div></div><div><br/></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><div><p>Globally available resources have become the status quo. They're accessible, distributed, and resilient. Our traditional SQL database options haven't kept up. Centralized SQL databases, even those with read replicas in the cloud, put all the transactional load on a central system. The further away that a transaction happens from the user, the more the user experience suffers. If the transactional data powering the application is greatly slowed down, fast-loading web pages mean nothing.</p><p>In this report, Paul Modderman, Jim Walker, and Charles Custer explain how distributed SQL fits all applications and eliminates complex challenges like sharding from traditional RDBMS systems. You'll learn how distributed SQL databases can reach global scale without introducing the consistency trade-offs found in NoSQL solutions. These databases come to life through cloud computing, while legacy databases simply can't rise to meet the elastic and ubiquitous new paradigm.</p><p>You'll learn:</p><ul><li>Key concepts driving this new technology, including the CAP theorem, the Raft consensus algorithm, multiversion concurrency control, and Google Spanner</li><li>How distributed SQL databases meet enterprise requirements, including management, security, integration, and Everything as a Service (XaaS)</li><li>The impact that distributed SQL has already made in the telecom, retail, and gaming industries</li><li>Why serverless computing is an ideal fit for distributed SQL</li><li>How distributed SQL can help you expand your company's strategic plan</li></ul></div></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p></p><p>The age of the distributed team is upon us. Teams can now operate and collaborate from locations other than a central office, and events surrounding the 2020 COVID pandemic have thrown its practicality into sharp relief. Managing a team whose members are distributed across several locations requires a different mindset and will remain a must-have for all areas of business from this point forward.</p><p><i>Building and Managing High-Performance Distributed Teams</i> explains what the <i>distributed teams</i> concept means to the future of your company. Author Alberto S. Silveira Jr. leverages his industry knowledge to explore why the high-performance distributed team model is vital to the future of business, and explains how to build and maintain one through times of change. You will learn to differentiate between distributed teams, remote work, offshoring, and what each means in a modern context. Silveira also weaves in stories from his other life as a boater and sailor, using analogies and lessons gained from humankind’s thousands of years of maritime adventure to illustrate the value of well-managed teams, and to also convey the importance of life-work balance in today’s working world.</p><p>The book analyzes team management strategies from some of the great successes and failures in recent years so that you can learn from the experiences of others. <i>Building and Managing High-Performance Distributed Teams</i> is your definitive guide for building a dynamic distributed team, using collaboration technology to attract and engage the most important element of any business—your people. Whether you are a department head, a business owner, or a team leader, this book presents the no-nonsense knowledge you need now to chart your course for success.</p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><p></p><ul><li>Understand what the new era of connected business means, and the role distributed teams will play.</li><li>Differentiate between distributed teams, remote work, nearshore, and offshoring, and what each means to modern business.</li><li>Discover the true heart of a high-performance distributed team (hint: it’s not the technology).</li><li>Find out what the era of distributed teams means to existing infrastructure.</li><li>Uncover what we can learn about team management from some of the great successes and failures of recent years.</li><li>Appreciate the techniques honed by seafarers, pilots, and software designers combined to create a successful project plan for team management and company navigation.</li><li>Comprehend the effective simplicity of the “power of three” in building successful teams.</li><li>Apply proven techniques of measurement and metrics without leaving the human factor behind to improve team morale and productivity.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>Team leaders or officers of small-ish companies, with populations in the tens through to the mid-hundreds.

It begins by describing the role of switch/routers in a network, then moves on to the functional composition of a switch/router. A comparison of centralized versus distributed design of the architecture is also presented. The author discusses use of bus versus shared-memory for communication within a design, and also covers Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms and configuration tools.</p><p>Written in a simple style and language to allow readers to easily understand and appreciate the material presented, <i>Switch/Router Architectures: Shared-Bus and Shared-Memory Based Systems</i> discusses the design of multilayer switches—starting with the basic concepts and on to the basic architectures. It describes the evolution of multilayer switch designs and highlights the major performance issues affecting each design. It addresses the need to build faster multilayer switches and examines the architectural constraints imposed by the various multilayer switch designs. The book also discusses design issues including performance, implementation complexity, and scalability to higher speeds. This resource also:</p><ul><li>Summarizes principles of operation and explores the most common installed routers</li><li>Covers the design of example architectures (shared bus and memory based architectures), starting from early software based designs</li><li>Provides case studies to enhance reader comprehension</li></ul><p><i>Switch/Router Architectures: Shared-Bus and Shared-Memory Based Systems</i> is an excellent guide for advanced undergraduate and graduate level students, as well for engineers and researchers working in the field.</p></span>",

    "title": "Distributed Data Fusion for Network-Centric Operations",
    "description": "<span><p>With the recent proliferation of service-oriented architectures (SOA), cloud computing technologies, and distributed-interconnected systems, distributed fusion is taking on a larger role in a variety of applications—from environmental monitoring and crisis management to intelligent buildings and defense. Drawing on the work of leading experts around the world, <strong>Distributed Data Fusion for Network-Centric Operations </strong>examines the state of the art of data fusion in a distributed sensing, communications, and computing environment.</p><p><strong><em>Get Insight into Designing and Implementing Data Fusion in a Distributed Network</em></strong></p><p>Addressing the entirety of information fusion, the contributors cover everything from signal and image processing, through estimation, to situation awareness. In particular, the work offers a timely look at the issues and solutions involving fusion within a distributed network enterprise. These include critical design problems, such as how to maintain a pedigree of agents or nodes that receive information, provide their contribution to the dataset, and pass to other network components. The book also tackles dynamic data sharing within a network-centric enterprise, distributed fusion effects on state estimation, graph-theoretic methods to optimize fusion performance, human engineering factors, and computer ontologies for higher levels of situation assessment.</p><p>A comprehensive introduction to this emerging field and its challenges, the book explores how data fusion can be used within grid, distributed, and cloud computing architectures. Bringing together both theoretical and applied research perspectives, this is a valuable reference for fusion researchers and practitioners. It offers guidance and insight for those working on the complex issues of designing and implementing distributed, decentralized information fusion.</p></span>",

In this practical book, leading hands-on software architects share case studies to introduce metrics that every software architect should know.</p><p>This isn't a book about theory. It's more about practice and implementation, about what has already been tried and worked. Detecting software architectural issues early is crucial for the success of your software: it helps mitigate the risk of poor performance and lowers the cost of repairing those issues. Written by practitioners for software architects and software developers eager to explore successful case studies, this guide will help you learn more about decision and measurement effectiveness.</p><p>Through contributions from 10 prominent practitioners, this book shares key software architecture metrics to help you set the right KPIs and measure the results. You'll learn how to:</p><ul><li>Measure how well your software architecture is meeting your goals</li><li>Choose the right metrics to track (and skip the ones you don't need)</li><li>Improve observability, testability, and deployability</li><li>Prioritize software architecture projects</li><li>Build insightful and relevant dashboards</li></ul></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>To meet the critical needs of modern business, software must now be able to react quickly to changes, allowing new features to be conceived, developed, and put into production rapidly. This requirement to respond fluently to changes has an important impact upon the architecture of a software system: software has to be built in such a way that it’s able to adapt to unexpected changes in features and can be regularly revised and refactored to meet a product’s goals.</p><p>Join us for a special conversation with Neal Ford and software development thought leader and ThoughtWorks chief scientist Martin Fowler. They’ll explore the interplay between the shift toward Agile thinking and the technical patterns and practices that make Agile software development practical. While the specifics of technology can change rapidly, the fundamental best practices and patterns you’ll learn are more stable and will allow you to respond more fluently to changes.</p><p>Neal and Martin spend a few minutes covering the trends in software architecture that are driving the need for change, then tell you what you need to know to stay ahead of the curve.</p>What you’ll learn and how you can apply it<ul><li>Learn how to make Agile software development practical</li><li>See what’s coming next with software architecture</li></ul>This recording of a live event is for you because…<ul><li>You want to better understand what you can do to improve your software architecture.</li><li>You want to discover ways to adapt to unexpected changes in features.</li></ul><p><strong>Recommended follow-up:</strong></p><ul><li>Read <em><a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/refactoring-improving-the/9780134757681/\" target=\"_blank\">Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code</a></em> (book)</li><li>Read <em><a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/patterns-of-enterprise/0321127420/\" target=\"_blank\">Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</a></em> (book)</li><li>Read <em><a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-the/9781492086888/\" target=\"_blank\">Software Architecture: The Hard Parts</a></em> (book)</li><li>Read <em><a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-software/9781492043447/\" target=\"_blank\">Fundamentals of Software Architecture</a></em> (book)</li><li>Take <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/search/?query=%22Software%20Architecture%20by%20Example%22&amp;extended_publisher_data=true&amp;highlight=true&amp;include_assessments=false&amp;include_case_studies=true&amp;include_courses=true&amp;include_playlists=true&amp;include_collections=true&amp;include_notebooks=true&amp;include_sandboxes=true&amp;include_scenarios=true&amp;is_academic_institution_account=false&amp;source=user&amp;formats=live%20online%20training&amp;sort=relevance&amp;facet_json=true&amp;json_facets=true&amp;page=0&amp;include_facets=true&amp;include_practice_exams=true\" target=\"_blank\">Software Architecture by Example</a> (live online training course with Mark Richards and Neal Ford)</li><li>Take <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/search/?query=%22Comparing%20Software%20Architectures%22&amp;extended_publisher_data=true&amp;highlight=true&amp;include_assessments=false&amp;include_case_studies=true&amp;include_courses=true&amp;include_playlists=true&amp;include_collections=true&amp;include_notebooks=true&amp;include_sandboxes=true&amp;include_scenarios=true&amp;is_academic_institution_account=false&amp;source=user&amp;formats=live%20online%20training&amp;sort=relevance&amp;facet_json=true&amp;json_facets=true&amp;page=0&amp;include_facets=true&amp;include_practice_exams=true\" target=\"_blank\">Comparing Software Architectures</a> (live online training course with Mark Richards and Neal Ford)</li></ul></div></span>",

And you may not even have heard of Alloy, Modelica, or SNOBOL. But all are identified as languages, even if they’re not generally considered as such. So what are the distinctions among them? And maybe most importantly, what can programmers learn from “not programming languages”?</p><p>Join us for a special conversation on programming languages with Neal Ford and Mozilla software engineer Chelsea Troy. They’ll talk about what constitutes a programming language, what we can learn from questioning how we categorize things, and how to identify “assumed context” and why it matters.

From the engineer practices of extreme programming to continuous delivery, the DevOps revolution, microservices, containerization, and now cloud-based resources, all of these innovations have led to new capabilities and trade-offs.</p><p>Expert Neal Ford looks at software architecture in a modern light, taking into account all the innovations from the last decade, along with some new metrics and measures suited to the new structures and perspectives now available.</p><p>Recorded on February 19, 2020.

    "description": "<span><p>Graduate to the next level of your software development career, learning the tools you need to successfully manage the complexity of modern software systems.</p><p>Whether you are a developer at a small software company, or one of many developers at a large enterprise, your success directly correlates to the ability of your development team to rapidly respond to change. What makes this task challenging in today’s world, is that the technical challenges we as developers strive to overcome are becoming increasingly more complex. We have to consider many more options when it comes to things like requirements, solution hosting, support, pace of change, and generally with less time and warning.</p><p>A good developer knows that it is critical to manage every aspect of software development from soup to nuts, and understands that when details and decisions are left to chance, outcomes can be negatively impacted. Poor planning can result in increased errors, substandard quality, budget and schedule overruns, and result in the ultimate business failure, dissatisfied customers, and stakeholders.</p><p>This book will help you put on the lenses of a software engineer. You will come away with an understanding of how to view the entire spectrum of the software development process, learn valuable concepts, and apply these principles through meaningful examples, case studies, and source code.</p><p> </p><p><br/></p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><p></p><ul><li>Move beyond being a programmer to being a professional software engineer</li><li>Spend more time doing software development; minimize time spent dealing with ineffective or inadequate processes</li><li>Reduce errors in judgment and provide predictable outcomes, while still maintaining agility and responsiveness using Lean and Agile practices</li><li>Know the steps you can take to ensure a shared understanding among stakeholders</li><li>Discover tools to validate user experience early and often to minimize costly re-work</li><li>Develop software designs and architectures that enable long-term business agility</li><li>Implement patterns and processes that result in “falling into the pit of success” instead of into the “pit of failure”</li><li>Adopt processes and patterns that will result in pervasive “institutionalized” quality</li><li>Understand the necessity of redefining the essential role of technical leadership to ensure team maturity and growth</li></ul><p></p><p> </p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>Software developers and team leaders who have struggled to implement design and development best practices due to lack of team resources, in-depth knowledge, or experience, and want a book designed to provide the confidence and foundational skills needed to achieve success</p></span>",

This book closely examines how a system is designed to tie a series of activities together that are needed when building software-intensive systems. <div><br/></div><div>Software construction and operations don't get enough attention as a repeatable system. The world is stuck in agile backlog grooming sessions, and quality is not increasing. Companies' budgets are shrinking, and teams need a way to get more done with less, consistently. This topic is very relevant to our current economic conditions and continuing globalization trends. A reason we constantly need more hands-on-the-keyboards is because of all the waste created in development cycles. We need more literature on how to \"do software\" not just write software.  </div><div><br/></div><div>These goals are accomplished using the concept of evolutions, much like the Navy SEALS train their team members.  For LIFT, the evolutions are: Plan, Build, Test, Release, Operate and Manage.  The entire purpose of the book is instructing professionals how to use these distinct evolutions while remaining agile. And then, inside of each evolution, to explicitly break down the inputs to the evolution, outputs and series of activities taking place.<i> Patterns of Software Constructio</i>n clearly outlines how together this becomes the system.</div><div><br/></div><div><b>What You Will Learn</b></div><div><div><ul><li>Optimize each evolution of a software delivery cycle</li><li>Review best practices of planning, highest return in the build cycle, and ignored practices in test, release, and operate </li><li>Apply the highest return techniques during the software build evolution</li></ul></div><div><br/></div><div><b>Who This Book is For</b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>Managers, developers, tech lead, team lead, aspiring engineer, department leaders in corporations, executives, small business owner, IT Director<br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></div><div><br/></div></span>",

When approached deliberately, software architecture and design can produce benefits for teams in a variety of ways.</p><p>James Thompson (Cingo Solutions) demonstrates how to assess approaches and make decisions based on what matters to your team and your projects by answering the following guiding questions:</p><ul><li>What is software architecture?</li><li>What decisions are architectural?</li><li>How do you discuss software architecture?</li><li>How do you document architectural decisions?</li><li>How do you encourage continued learning?</li></ul><p>These questions give you a framework for thinking about how to do software architecture in a collaborative way. Software development is a collaborative effort, and software architecture should be also. Software architecture is something that every developer should be equipped and empowered to engage with—leading to a more collaborative way of developing and maintaining your software systems.</p><p>This session was recorded at the 2019 O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference in New York.</p></div></span></span>",

But adopting open source practices without understanding the cultural context behind them often fails. That’s where this report comes in.</p><p>Author Silona Bonewald explains how the InnerSource initiative, introduced by PayPal, can help your company develop software internally by applying lessons from the open source movement. A checklist guides you through various steps needed to produce open source software, whether it’s companywide or just for one team.</p><p>Alongside the <i>how</i>, Bonewald—Director of InnerSource Commons—also explains the <i>why</i> behind open source. You’ll learn ways to improve collaboration, create cleaner code, reduce bottlenecks, and facilitate integrations among teams.</p><p>This report examines:</p><ul><li>Ways to adapt InnerSource to your business environment without diluting open source fundamentals</li><li>The crucial role of the Trusted Committer in the InnerSource process</li><li>How to extracting tribal knowledge from silos through <i>passive documentation</i></li><li>Why <i>contributing agreements</i> formalize the responsibilities of developers who originate code</li><li>How to move from internal silos to internal transparency</li></ul></div></span>",

And yet, long-term observations in the field by the Software Improvement Group (SIG) reveals that many organizations don’t have the necessary resources or institutional processes to make it happen.</p><p>In this report, you’ll learn how 1,442 software developers responded to a 2016 survey on code quality conducted by SIG in collaboration with O’Reilly. The results reinforce previous findings that, although code quality is valued in principle, software development organizations often measure and manage it unevenly—or not at all—in their day-to-day practices.</p><p>This report provides a detailed assessment of responses to survey questions about working environments, accountability for code quality, and the use of code quality processes and tools. Major findings reveal that:</p><ul><li>A large majority of respondents believe that accountability for code quality rests with individual developers and their teams</li><li>Most developers don’t use tools for improving software quality, largely because they lack the budget to acquire them</li><li>Many developers can’t rely on common code quality tools because those tools don’t support the technologies and languages they use</li><li>Other developers are simply unaware of available tools, or are working with teams that have never used them</li></ul><p>How does your organization and development team stack up against these survey results? Compare your coding habits to the questions in this report and learn about your own code quality efforts and capabilities.</p></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Conventional build-then-test practices are\nmaking today’s embedded, software-reliant systems\nunaffordable to build. In response, more than thirty leading\nindustrial organizations have joined SAE (formerly, the Society of\nAutomotive Engineers) to define the SAE Architecture Analysis &amp;\nDesign Language (AADL) AS-5506 Standard, a rigorous and extensible\nfoundation for model-based engineering analysis practices that\nencompass software system design, integration, and assurance. Using\nAADL, you can conduct lightweight and rigorous analyses of critical\nreal-time factors such as performance, dependability, security, and\ndata integrity. You can integrate additional established and custom\nanalysis/specification techniques into your engineering\nenvironment, developing a fully unified architecture model that\nmakes it easier to build reliable systems that meet customer\nexpectations.</p><p><b><em>Model-Based Engineering with\nAADL</em></b> is the first guide to using this new international\nstandard to optimize your development processes. Coauthored by\nPeter H. Feiler, the standard’s author and technical lead,\nthis introductory reference and tutorial is ideal for self-directed\nlearning or classroom instruction, and is an excellent reference\nfor practitioners, including architects, developers, integrators,\nvalidators, certifiers, first-level technical leaders, and project\nmanagers. Packed with real-world examples, it introduces all\naspects of the AADL notation as part of an architecture-centric,\nmodel-based engineering approach to discovering embedded software\nsystems problems earlier, when they cost less to solve. Throughout,\nthe authors compare AADL to other modeling notations and\napproaches, while presenting the language via a complete case\nstudy: the development and analysis of a realistic example system\nthrough repeated refinement and analysis.</p><p><b>Part One</b> introduces both the AADL\nlanguage and core Model-Based Engineering (MBE) practices,\nexplaining basic software systems modeling and analysis in the\ncontext of an example system, and offering practical guidelines for\neffectively applying AADL.</p><p><b>Part Two</b> describes the\ncharacteristics of each AADL element, including their\nrepresentations, applicability, and constraints.</p><p>The Appendix includes comprehensive listings\nof AADL language elements, properties incorporated in the AADL\nstandard, and a description of the book’s example system.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p><i>There is today a pronounced and accelerated convergence in architecture. This convergence is occurring by doers not thinkers; in practice not academia; in building design, fabrication, and construction. It is about solution-centric individuals engaged in real time problem solving, not in abstractions. The nature of this convergence, where things are converging and what that means for architecture, is the subject of this book. –</i> from the Introduction<br/><br/></p><p>Those working in architecture and engineering feel pressure to work faster, at lower cost, while maintaining a high level of innovation and quality. At the same time, emergent tools and processes make this possible. <i>Convergence</i> is about the firms, teams and people who thrive in this environment as a result of their ability to creatively combine and innovate. It seeks to answer several timely questions: What are the tools and work processes that are converging? How are individuals and organizations converging their tools and work processes? What challenges and benefits are they seeing? What is the ultimate endgame of this convergence? What skillsets and mindsets would someone need to develop to work effectively in this changing environment? What are the implications of convergence on the role of the designer, and on design? On how we design, build, fabricate, and construct? On how we <i>work</i>?</p><p>The book explains how convergence relates to, but ultimately differs from integration, consolidation, multi-tasking, automation, and other forms of optimization. The practice-based research builds upon the author’s research in BIM and in the collaborative leveraging of data in design and fabrication. As an investigation and meditation on the impact of technology on the education and making of design professionals <i>Convergence</i> explains what is happening in the world of design, and discusses the implications for the future of education, training and practice.</p><p> </p></span></span></span>",

Given available software tools and libraries—many of which are free—hobbyists can build small or short-lived computer apps.

Emphasizing a top-down approach, this volume considers the purpose and basic features of design and how the concept of value can provide a quantitative measure of that wider interaction of the engineered object with its environment. This work also develops the domain in which functional design takes place and explores how the system concept can be embedded in that domain. It proposes a number of functional design elements and develops them in considerable detail, outlining how they can be applied as part of a coherent design framework.

    "description": "<span><span><p><strong>Opto-Mechanical Systems Design, Fourth Edition</strong> is different in many ways from its three earlier editions: coauthor Daniel Vukobratovich has brought his broad expertise in materials, opto-mechanical design, analysis of optical instruments, large mirrors, and structures to bear throughout the book; Jan Nijenhuis has contributed a comprehensive new chapter on kinematics and applications of flexures; and several other experts in special aspects of opto-mechanics have contributed portions of other chapters. An expanded feature—a total of 110 worked-out design examples—has been added to several chapters to show how the theory, equations, and analytical methods can be applied by the reader. Finally, the extended text, new illustrations, new tables of data, and new references have warranted publication of this work in the form of two separate but closely entwined volumes.</p><p>This first volume, <b>Design and Analysis of Opto-Mechanical Assemblies</b>, addresses topics pertaining primarily to optics smaller than 50 cm aperture. It summarizes the opto-mechanical design process, considers pertinent environmental influences, lists and updates key parameters for materials, illustrates numerous ways for mounting individual and multiple lenses, shows typical ways to design and mount windows and similar components, details designs for many types of prisms and techniques for mounting them, suggests designs and mounting techniques for small mirrors, explains the benefits of kinematic design and uses of flexures, describes how to analyze various types of opto-mechanical interfaces, demonstrates how the strength of glass can be determined and how to estimate stress generated in optics, and explains how changing temperature affects opto-mechanical assemblies. </p></span></span>",

Such a system is viewed as an Open System since its functions, structures, and boundaries are constantly changing. Thus, the approach to dependability is called Open Systems Dependability. The DEOS technology realizes Open Systems Dependability. It puts more emphasis on stakeholders’ agreement and accountability achievement for business/service continuity than in elemental technologies. </p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Modeling complex systems is a difficult challenge and all too often one in which modelers are left to their own devices. Using a multidisciplinary approach, The Art of Software Modeling covers theory, practice, and presentation in detail. It focuses on the importance of model creation and demonstrates how to create meaningful models. </p><p>Presenting three self-contained sections, the text examines the background of modeling and frameworks for organizing information. It identifies techniques for researching and capturing client and system information and addresses the challenges of presenting models to specific audiences. Using concepts from art theory and aesthetics, this broad-based approach encompasses software practices, cognitive science, and information presentation. The book also looks at perception and cognition of diagrams, view composition, color theory, and presentation techniques. </p><p>Providing practical methods for investigating and organizing complex information, The Art of Software Modeling demonstrates the effective use of modeling techniques to improve the development process and establish a functional, useful, and maintainable software system. </p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>Executable UML is a major innovation in the field of software\ndevelopment. It is designed to produce a comprehensive and\nunderstandable model of a solution independent of the organization\nof the software implementation. It is a highly abstract thinking\ntool that aids in the formalization of knowledge, and is also a way\nof describing the concepts that make up abstract solutions to\nsoftware development problems.</p><p>This timely new book, <b><em>Executable UML: A Foundation for\nModel-Driven Architecture,</em></b> thoroughly introduces,\ndocuments, and explains this important new technology. The authors\nshow how UML can formalize requirements and use cases into a rich\nset of verifiable diagrams, how it can be used to produce\nexecutable and testable models, and how these models can be\ntranslated directly into code. In addition, the book explains how\nindividual system domains are woven together by an executable UML\nmodel compiler.</p><p>The book is full of tips and techniques to help you:</p><ul><li><p>Partition a system into subject matters based on individual\naspects</p></li><li><p>Pick the right level for use case modeling to speed subject\nmatter comprehension</p></li><li><p>Model classes and focus on relationships to capture subject\nmatter semantics precisely</p></li><li><p>Express behavior using the newly adopted UML action semantics\nand action languages</p></li><li><p>Specify constraints using tags specified in OCL (Object\nConstraint Language)</p></li></ul><p>In addition, this book tackles topics of particular importance\nin execution, such as how to:</p><ul><li><p>Synchronize objects by building lifecycles using statechart\ndiagrams</p></li><li><p>Model relationships and contention safely</p></li><li><p>Distribute dynamics to avoid unmaintainable controller\nobjects</p></li><li><p>Verify the models by executing test cases against the\nstatechart diagrams and constraints</p></li></ul><p>A large-scale, fully developed case study runs throughout the\nbook to illustrate concepts and techniques.

Software Architecture Design Patterns in Java is a detailed explanation of how to apply design patterns and develop software architectures. It provides in-depth examples in Java, and guides students by detailing when, why, and how to use specific patterns. This textbook presents 42 design patterns, including 23 GoF patterns. Categories include: Basic, Creational, Collectional, Structural, Behavioral, and Concurrency, with multiple examples for each. The discussion of each pattern includes an example implemented in Java. The source code for all examples is found on a companion Web site. The author explains the content so that it is easy to understand, and each pattern discussion includes Practice Questions to aid instructors. The textbook concludes with a case study that pulls several patterns together to demonstrate how patterns are not applied in isolation, but collaborate within domains to solve complicated problems.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>At Honeycomb, customers send lots of data and then compose complex, ad hoc queries. Most are simple, some are not, and some are really not. The load is complex, spontaneous, and urgent, and it would have been prohibitively expensive to size a server cluster to handle big queries quickly. So Honeycomb took a different approach: farm the work out to AWS Lambda, Amazon's serverless offering. In this model, Lambda becomes an on-demand accelerator for Honeycomb’s always-on servers. The benefits are immense, improving response times by an order of magnitude. But the challenges are numerous and often unexpected.</p><p>Join us for this Case Study with Honeycomb developer advocate Jessica Kerr to learn how Honeycomb approached the problem of handling its clients’ queries with Lambda. You’ll learn the benefits and constraints of the serverless-as-accelerator model and get practical advice based on Honeycomb’s own hard-earned experience.</p><p>Recorded on April 26, 2022.

Developers, for example, can build better solutions only if they receive the necessary design information from architects, and decision-makers can make appropriate changes within the organization only if they know the implications of doing so.</p><p>The book starts by addressing the problems faced by enterprise architecture practitioners and provides solutions based on an agile approach to enterprise architecture, using ArchiMate® 3.1 as an industry standard and Sparx EA as the modeling tool. You'll learn with the help of a fictional organization that has three business units, each expecting something different from you as the enterprise architect. You'll build the practice, satisfy the different requirements of each business unit, and share the knowledge with others so they can follow your steps. Toward the end, you'll learn how to put the diagrams and the content that you have developed into documents, presentations, and web pages that can be published and shared with any stakeholder.</p><p>By the end of this book, you'll be able to build a functional enterprise architecture practice that supports every part of your organization. You'll also have developed the necessary skills to populate your enterprise architecture repository with references and artifacts.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Discover how enterprise architects can contribute to projects and departments within organizations</li><li>Use Sparx Enterprise Architect to build a rich architecture repository</li><li>Learn about the ArchiMate® 3.1 specification as you apply it in real-world projects</li><li>Use the focused metamodel technique to build the information necessary for maintaining your repository's consistency and accuracy</li><li>Understand the importance of keeping architectural artifacts simple yet eye-catching</li><li>Define an operational model that fits your initial needs and expands as required</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book is for enterprise architects at all architectural layers and practices of any maturity level. Many of the artifacts suggested in this book are inspired by The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF®); however, familiarity with TOGAF® is not required. Whether you work within the business, applications, data, or technology layers, this book covers examples that apply to your work. Although not mandatory, experience modeling in Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect using any modeling language will be helpful. No prior knowledge of ArchiMate® is required to get started with this book.</p></span>",

Here, you will create a Twitter bot function which scans Twitter for the latest tweets and makes use of dependency injection. Further, you will learn about Azure Cosmos DB where you will cover its change feed mechanism and the repository pattern. You will create a Cosmos DB trigger-based tweet notifier function, which will broadcast the latest tweets to connected clients. You will explore the basics of Azure Service Bus and create a tweet scheduler function, which will prioritize different keywords for the Twitter bot function. Along the way, you will debug, deliver, and test the functions in the Azure environment.</p><p>This book shows you how to secure your Azure Function secrets with the help of Azure Key Vault. To further your understanding of the technology, you will learn logging and exception handling in Azure Functions.</p>Later in the book, you will build a Twitter bot web application by using ASP.NET Core and Materialize CSS, which will interact with several HTTP-based Azure Functions. The Twitter bot web application allows users to log in through the Twitter Identity Provider, subscribe to different keywords/hashtags, and browse the latest tweets based on subscriptions. You will get started with SignalR Service and integrate it with Azure Functions and web applications. Towards the end you will go through app service authentication on Azure Functions and discover how to configure continuous integration and delivery to Azure Functions. <p></p><p> After reading this book, you will be able to understand the steps involved in design, development, and delivery of a workflow using Azure Functions.<br/></p></div><div><br/></div><div><b>What You Will Learn</b><br/><ul><li>Design and develop a Twitter bot      application using Azure Functions with Azure Web App Service as the front      end<br/></li><li>Leverage Azure Cosmos DB as      data storage and trigger notifications using its change feed mechanism<br/></li><li>Store and retrieve secrets from Azure Key Vault<br/></li><li>Integrate Azure Functions with      Azure SignalR Service to broadcast real-time messages<br/></li><li>Secure Azure Functions by      enabling Twitter identity authentication using built-in App Service      authentication<br/></li><li>Build a continuous integration and continuous delivery pipeline for Azure Functions using Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS)<br/></li></ul></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b></div><div><br/></div><div>Developers, software engineers, and architects who design and manage infrastructures and build applications by leveraging Microsoft cloud services.</div><div><br/></div></span>",

While scheduling a limited number of data workflows is a generally manageable task, scaling to hundreds of data workflows with dependencies and diverse job types requires substantial customized engineering, complexity, and overall expensive resources. Serverless-based architectures offer an alternative to traditional resource management.\n            </p><p>\n                Tomer Levi explains how the data engineering team at Fundbox uses AWS Step Functions, Docker containers, and Spark to build a live, serverless data orchestration platform, focusing on the company’s decision to build a friendly, yet powerful and scalable solution. Tomer details AWS Step Functions state machines, their limitations, and how to overcome them by building custom job-scheduling and dependency features. He illustrates how resource bottlenecks were overcome using Docker containers and AWS Fargate.

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>The last two decades have seen evolutions of software architecture—from on-premises to cloud hosted to mass-scaled microservices. While cloud native applications look very different than something we may have built before some of these techniques were well known, at their heart are still long-running, custom-built server applications that orchestrate the flow of requests, data, and logic.</p><p>Serverless changes all of this. We no longer build always-on server applications; we rely on events as the agents of flow rather than requests, and the server-side software that we do write may be a small aspect of our system rather than the central hub. Fundamentally, serverless is about choreography of multiple services from multiple teams and vendors—in extreme situations—none of which we have written ourselves.</p><p>Mike Roberts (Symphonia) introduces some of the patterns, or “common solutions to recurring problems,” that we are starting to see in the serverless community. Patterns are not necessarily best practices—they are techniques that have worked for many people, but always given certain contextual constraints. Perhaps even more importantly, however, Mike describes how you, your teams, and your organizations can start harvesting your own patterns, while the bigger industry learns more about this exciting new frontier.</p><p>This session was recorded at the 2019 O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference in San Jose.</p></div></span></span>",

Traditionally, virtual machines and containers were the principal mediums for deploying microservices, but they involved a lot of operational effort, configuration, and maintenance. More recently, serverless computing has gained popularity due to its built-in autoscaling abilities, reduced operational costs, and increased productivity.\n</p><p>Building Serverless Microservices in Python begins by introducing you to serverless microservice structures. You will then learn how to create your first serverless data API and test your microservice. Moving on, you'll delve into data management and work with serverless patterns. Finally, the book introduces you to the importance of securing microservices.\n</p><p>By the end of the book, you will have gained the skills you need to combine microservices with serverless computing, making their deployment much easier thanks to the cloud provider managing the servers and capacity planning.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Discover what microservices offer above and beyond other architectures\n</li><li>Create a serverless application with AWS\n</li><li>Gain secure access to data and resources\n</li><li>Run tests on your configuration and code\n</li><li>Create a highly available serverless microservice data API\n</li><li>Build, deploy, and run your serverless configuration and code\n</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>If you are a developer with basic knowledge of Python and want to learn how to build, test, deploy, and secure microservices, then this book is for you.

Enterprise Agility shows how an enterprise can address this challenge head on and thrive in the dynamic environment.</p>\n\n<p>Agility is a fundamental shift in thinking about how enterprises work to effectively deal with disruptive changes in the business environment. The core belief underlying agility is that enterprises are open and living systems. These living systems, also known as complex adaptive systems (CAS), are ideally suited to deal with change very effectively.</p>\n\n<p>Agility is to enterprises what health is to humans. There are some foundational principles that can be broadly applied, but the definition of healthy is very specific to each individual. Enterprise Agility takes a similar approach with regard to agility: it suggests foundational practices to improve the overall health of the body culture, mindset, and leadership and the health of its various organs: people, process, governance, structure, technology, and customers. The book also suggests a practical framework to create a plan to enhance agility.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Go Serverless! Build, deploy &amp; manage apps with Spring Framework &amp; Spring Cloud Functions in AWS</p><p><b>About This Video</b></p><ul><li>Design a real-world serverless application from scratch using Spring Cloud Functions and Spring Boot</li><li>Build scalable, reliable, and cost-efficient applications with serverless architecture on AWS using Spring and Spring Cloud Functions</li><li>Learn serverless computing by building a practical application with Spring and AWS platform</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Removing the concept of a “server” from your application is huge. Cloud-based infrastructure was a game changer for software development and serverless architectures is the next step in that evolution. Building serverless applications means that your developers can focus on their core product instead of worrying about managing and operating servers or runtimes, either in the cloud or on-premises. Many companies have started adopting serverless architecture for their applications to save costs and improve scalability. This course demonstrates a key strength of serverless computing in AWS using Spring.</p><p>This course will introduce you to Serverless Architecture and lead you to build a simple image-resizing service using a Java-based AWS Lambda function. Then we’ll move onto how the Spring framework supports the cloud and in particular AWS. There are a number of different services made available through Spring annotations to make your life easier.</p><p>Moving on, you’ll start to build your Spring-based, serverless application that will take a URL and convert it into a short URL that will be stored in DynamoDB and you’ll receive a short URL. You can then use that short URL in a browser and then be redirected to the real site. To demonstrate integration with AWS’ Simple Notification Service (SNS), the application will also send a notification to you whenever someone creates a new short URL. Lastly, you’ll learn about monitoring your application using AWS cloud watch.</p><p>By the end of the course, you’ll be equipped with the knowledge to build scalable and cost-efficient Spring applications with serverless architectures.</p><p>The code bundle for this video course is available at- <a href=\"https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-Serverless-Applications-with-Spring-and-AWS\">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-Serverless-Applications-with-Spring-and-AWS</a>.</p><p/></span>",

To really address the data concerns of today's enterprise, they wanted to find a way to help enterprises achieve the success they seek. Not as a prescriptive process-but a methodology to become agile and leverage data and analytics to drive a competitive advantage.</p>\n\n<p>You know, it's amazing what can happen when two people with very different perspectives get together to solve a big problem. This evolutionary guide resulted from the a-ha moment between these two influencers at the top of their fields-one, an academic researcher and consultant, and the other, a longtime analytics practitioner and chief product officer at Teradata. Together, they created a powerful framework every type of business can use to connect analytic power, business practices, and human dynamics in ways that can transform what is currently possible.</p></span>",

This is architecting the future enterprise: creating a blueprint for what the enterprise will look like after the transformation.</p>\n\n<p>Nightingale and Rhodes introduce the ARIES (Architecting Innovative Enterprise Strategy) framework, including a ten enterprise element model and an architecting process model, and show how to apply it, from start to finish.

Also known as <i>Function as a Service</i>, serverless computing lets developers deploy applications to the cloud without having to provision or manage a server—or pay for a server when it’s not in use.

They continually hear the same issues, such as:</p><ul><li>We're spending valuable meeting time wondering why everyone's data doesn't match up.</li><li>We can't leverage our economies of scale while remaining agile with data.</li><li>We need self-serve apps that let the enterprise experiment with data and accelerate the development process.</li><li>We need to get on a more predictive curve to ensure long-term success.</li></ul><p>To really address the data concerns of today's enterprise, they wanted to find a way to help enterprises achieve the success they seek. Not as a prescriptive process—but a methodology to become agile and leverage data and analytics to drive a competitive advantage.</p><p>You know, it's amazing what can happen when two people with very different perspectives get together to solve a big problem. This evolutionary guide resulted from the <i>a-ha</i> moment between these two influencers at the top of their fields—one, an academic researcher and consultant, and the other, a longtime analytics practitioner and chief product officer at Teradata.

This completely rewritten version of the bestselling Architecture and Patterns for IT Service Management, Resource Planning and Governance retains the original (and still unique) approach: apply the discipline of enterprise architecture to the business of large scale IT management itself. Author Charles Betz applies his deep practitioner experience to a critical reading of ITIL 2011, COBIT version 4, the CMMI suite, the IT portfolio management literature, and the Agile/Lean IT convergence, and derives a value stream analysis, IT semantic model, and enabling systems architecture (covering current topics such as CMDB/CMS, Service Catalog, and IT Portfolio Management). Using the concept of design patterns, the book then presents dozens of visual models documenting challenging problems in integrating IT management, showing how process, data, and IT management systems must work together to enable IT and its business partners. The edition retains the fundamental discipline of traceable process, data, and system analysis that has made the first edition a favored desk reference for IT process analysts around the world.

    "description": "<span><span><span><p/><p>\nEnterprise architecture makes a vital contribution to the running of a large organisation. It was originally developed in order to manage a rapid growth in the cost and complexity of IT systems, using knowledge gained from software structure and design. For this reason, enterprise architecture is often thought of as a component of IT governance. However, the discipline has evolved and extended its scope. Enterprise architecture is now about structuring business capabilities and processes in order to support your long-term business strategy. Effective application of enterprise architecture will enable you to improve your productivity and performance.\n</p><p>\nThis pocket guide offers you an invaluable introduction to this business-critical subject. It explains the function of enterprise architecture within the organisation, looks at the skills needed within the enterprise architecture team and provides an overview of the most common enterprise architecture frameworks. As the author emphasises, enterprise architecture is not about creating models and designs for their own sake, but about using these structures to serve the needs of the business.\n</p><p><strong>Benefits to business include:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Make better decisions</strong>\n\n    As a discipline, enterprise architecture helps companies to understand the way that their component systems (e.g. security, business continuity or performance management) all fit together. The pocket guide will show you how enterprise architecture can lead to better decision making\n    </li><li><strong>Improve business effectiveness</strong>\n\n    Enterprise architecture maintains a holistic view of the organisation, taking into account different issues, such as efficient use of resources and reliable delivery of services, and showing how they relate to one another. This pocket guide explains how to build up a comprehensive overview of the enterprise that can be used to assess the trade-offs involved across various domains and priorities. This will help you to improve your organisation's integration and effectiveness\n    </li><li><strong>Improve your ability to manage risks</strong>\n\n    Enterprise architecture has an important function in risk management, and can help your organisation to achieve compliance with regulations, such as Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) and Basel II\n    </li><li><strong>Improve your ability to manage change</strong>\n\n    Every organisation is being forced to adapt as budgets grow tighter and new regulations are introduced. By enabling you to understand and map the interdependencies within your organisation, enterprise architecture makes it easier for you to work out the most effective solution.\n    </li></ul><p><span><strong>If you want your organisation to be more than the sum of its parts, buy this pocket guide today!</strong></span></p>\"\n</span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span>\nMany organizations struggle with the dynamics and the complexity of today's social ecosystems that connect everyone and everything, everywhere and all the time. Facing challenges at the intersection of business models, technical developments, and human needs, modern enterprises must overcome the siloed thinking and isolated efforts of the past, and instead address their relationships to people holistically. In <i>Intersection</i>, Milan Guenther introduces a Strategic Design approach that aligns the overarching efforts of Branding, Enterprise Architecture, and Experience Design, and sets them on a common course to shape tomorrow’s enterprises.<br/><br/>This book gives designers, entrepreneurs, innovators, and leaders a model and a comprehensive vocabulary for tackling such deep-rooted challenges. The Enterprise Design framework cuts through the complexity of Strategic Design work, showing how to navigate key aspects and bridge diverging viewpoints. In 9 case studies, the author looks at the way companies like SAP, BBVA, IKEA, and Jeppesen (a Boeing Company) apply design thinking and practice to shape their enterprises. Moving from strategy to conceptual design and concrete results,<i> Intersection</i> shows what is relevant at which point, and what expertise to involve.<ul><li>Teaches how to align business strategy with Brand Identity, Customer Experience, and Enterprise Architecture initiatives as part of a consolidated enterprise-wide design practice to achieve stakeholder value</li><li>Provides a framework for designing systems, products and services as the building blocks of a consistent and coherent experience for all stakeholders in the wider enterprise, joining strategic considerations with the delivery of tangible outcomes</li><li>Explains how to make results such as websites, apps, objects, platforms, or environments part of a larger system that orchestrates enterprise touchpoints with people</li></ul>\n</span>",

Enter model-driven architecture\n(MDA), a standard framework from the Object Management Group (OMG)\nthat allows developers to link object models together to build\ncomplete systems. MDA prevents design decisions from being\nintertwined with the application and keeps it independent of its\nimplementation. The result is an application that can be combined\nwith other technologies as well as other applications, and models\nthat become highly reusable assets.</p><p><em><b>MDA Distilled</b></em> is an accessible introduction to the\nMDA standard and its tools and technologies. The book describes the\nfundamental features of MDA, how they fit together, and how you can\nuse them in your organization today. You will also learn how to\ndefine a model-driven process for a project involving multiple\nplatforms, implement that process, and then test the resulting\nsystem.</p><p><b><em>MDA Distilled</em></b> will help you understand:</p><ul><li><p>The MDA framework, including the platform-independent model\n(PIM) and the platform-specific model (PSM)</p></li><li><p>The Meta Object Facility (MOF)--the OMG's adopted standard for\nmetamodeling</p></li><li><p>Horizontal, vertical, and merging mappings between models</p></li><li><p>Building marks and marking models</p></li><li><p>Elaborating models, including viewing generated models, and\nmanaging manual changes</p></li><li><p>Building executable models with Executable UML</p></li><li><p>Agile MDA development</p></li></ul><p>Developers and architects can dramatically improve productivity,\nportability, interoperability, and maintenance with MDA.

Software developers, architects, and technical management teams rely on high-level software design patterns such as microservices architecture, event-driven architecture, and the strategic patterns prescribed by domain-driven design (DDD) to make their work easier.</p><p>This book covers these proven architecture design patterns with a forward-looking approach to help Python developers manage application complexity—and get the most value out of their test suites.</p><p>Starting with the initial stages of design, you will learn about the main blocks and mental flow to use at the start of a project. The book covers various architectural patterns like microservices, web services, and event-driven structures and how to choose the one best suited to your project. Establishing a foundation of required concepts, you will progress into development, debugging, and testing to produce high-quality code that is ready for deployment. You will learn about ongoing operations on how to continue the task after the system is deployed to end users, as the software development lifecycle is never finished.</p><p>By the end of this Python book, you will have developed \"architectural thinking\": a different way of approaching software design, including making changes to ongoing systems.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Think like an architect, analyzing software architecture patterns</li><li>Explore API design, data storage, and data representation methods</li><li>Investigate the nuances of common architectural structures</li><li>Utilize and interoperate elements of patterns such as microservices</li><li>Implement test-driven development to perform quality code testing</li><li>Recognize chunks of code that can be restructured as packages</li><li>Maintain backward compatibility and deploy iterative changes</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book will help software developers and architects understand the structure of large complex systems and adopt architectural patterns that are scalable. Examples in the book are implemented in Python so a fair grasp of basic Python concepts is expected. Proficiency in any programming languages such as Java or JavaScript is sufficient.</p></span>",

    "title": "Combating Spyware in the Enterprise",
    "description": "<span>\nCombating Spyware in the Enterprise is the first book published on defending enterprise networks from increasingly sophisticated and malicious spyware.<br/><br/>Combating Spyware in the Enterprise begins by examining the various types of insidious spyware and adware currently propagating across the internet and infiltrating enterprise networks. This section closely examines Spyware’s ongoing transformation from nuisance to malicious, sophisticated attack vector. Next, the book uncovers spyware’s intricate economy and network of malicious hackers and criminals. Forensic investigations presented in this section of the book reveal how increasingly sophisticated spyware can compromise enterprise networks via trojans, keystroke loggers, system monitoring, distributed denial of service attacks, backdoors, viruses, and worms. After close examination of these attack vectors, the book begins to detail both manual and automated techniques for scanning your network for the presence of spyware, and customizing your IDS and IPS to detect spyware. From here, the book goes on to detail how to prevent spyware from being initially installed to mitigating the damage inflicted by spyware should your network become infected. Techniques discussed in this section include slowing the exposure rate; web filtering; using FireFox, MacOSX, or Linux; patching and updating, machine restrictions, shielding, deploying anti-spyware, and re-imaging. The book concludes with an analysis of the future of spyware and what the security community must accomplish to win the ware against spyware.<br/><br/>* A recent survey published by Information Security Magazine stated that \"combating spyare\" was the #2 priority for security professionals in 2005<br/>* Despite the high priority placed on combating spyware by security professionals, there are no other books published or announced that address this market * Author Paul Piccard is Director of Research for Webroot, which is a market leader for pure-play anti-spyware vendors\n</span>",

The need permeates the\nenterprise because it enables proactive decision-making for problem\navoidance, rather than reactive problem impact minimization. And\nthat is the key. Thus the need for, and focus on, is\nreal-time.<br/>\nCompanies no longer have the long strategic time-frames in which to\nplan, design, and manage their business processes. Yearly revenue\ngoals and measurements are fast becoming quarterly goals and\nmeasurements. Investors and share-holders are more demanding. They\nare more critical, and less forgiving, of missed performance goals.\nAnd these demands are coming at a time when the volume of data is\ngrowing, there is an increase in business mergers and acquisitions,\nthe use of strategic outsourcing is growing, and there is an\nincreasing requirement for faster and faster turnaround on\ninformation requests. This has put an enormous burden on the\ninformation technology (IT) organizations. And most of this change\nis centered around business intelligence, because that is the\nenvironment responsible for providing information for management\ndecision-making.<br/>\nThis IBM Redbooks publication explores the techniques and\ncapabilities for evolving to a real-time enterprise. It also\ndemonstrates approaches for that evolution and provides examples to\nhelp guide you in developing your strategy and implementation\nmethodology to become a real-time enterprise.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Be a part of a great course where you will be understanding distributed, scalable, fault-tolerance, and resilience systems along with building, designing, and implementing applications through these systems.</p><p><b>About This Video</b></p><ul><li>Design and implement globally distributed, scalable, fault-tolerant, and resilience applications</li><li>Understanding of common algorithms and techniques used in the majority of NoSQL databases and streaming platforms</li><li>In-depth knowledge of Apache Cassandra, Apache Kafka, and ETCD</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>A significant percentage of large-scale enterprises experience performance issues with their business-critical applications. Most of the production systems have been built on top of legacy, monolith technologies. The recent popularity of micro-services will not fulfill its promise of decoupled, scalable, and fault-tolerant systems, unless “done right”. While entering the world of micro-services, engineers start building distributed applications, where robust remote procedure calls and cluster coordination are a must.</p><p>You will look at various technologies, algorithms, and design patterns here. Some of them are Service Registry and Discovery, Service Mesh, Apache Cassandra ETCD (coordinator managing Kubernetes clusters), Apache Kafka, Idempotent service design, retry logic, Sharding, and Consistent Hashing, Client-side Load Balancing, Distributed Tracing, Canary Deployment, Sidecar Pattern, Circuit Breaker, and many more. Finally, you will also see the principles of various distributed systems designs; for example, master-less versus with leaders, poll-based versus push-based, immediate versus eventual consistency.</p><p>After completing the course, learning new distributed database technology would be easier, because you will know the commonly reused techniques, including their pros and cons.</p><p><b>Audience</b></p><p>This course is designed for Java developers and architects who wish to broaden their knowledge of distributed computing, NoSQL databases, efficient RPC calls, messaging middleware, and cluster coordination. It is also recommended for anyone working in modern IT landscapes. The course may be a good recap for people preparing for systems design interviews.</p><p>You will need proficiency in Java programming language, and an open mind to discover the challenges of distributed computing. Beginner-level knowledge in the Spring Boot framework will help you get along with the course easily.</p></span>",

This book teaches you how to implement the concepts and patterns present in DDD in the real world as a complete web application. With these tactics and concepts in place, you'll engage in a variety of example applications, built from the ground up, and taken directly from real-world domains. <p>Begin by reviewing foundational stepping stones (with small, manageable examples to show proof of concepts as well as illustrations to conceptualize the more complex topics) of both DDD and Laravel. Specifically, such topics as entities, value objects, developing an ubiquitous language, DTOs, and knowledge discovery. Next, you will dive into some more advanced topics of DDD and use these concepts as a guide to make customizations to the default Laravel installation, giving you an understanding of why these alterations are vital to the DDD and Laravel platform. Finally, you will cover the very powerful Eloquent ORM that comes stock with Laravel and understand how it can be utilized to represent entities, handle repositories, and support domain events. </p><p>Although there is a basic coverage chapter and a setup tutorial for Laravel (along with a high level intro about the components used within it), <i>Domain-Driven Laravel</i> is best suited to readers who have been at least exposed to the framework and have had the opportunity to tinker around with it.</p><p><b>What You'll Learn</b></p>\n<p></p><ul><li>Utilize a blazing-fast rapid development pipeline built from DDD building blocks and facilitated with Laravel<br/></li><li>Implement value objects, repositories, entities, anti-corruption layers and others using Laravel as a web framework</li><li>Apply enhanced techniques for quick prototyping of complex requirements and quality results using an iterative and focused approach </li><li>Create a base framework (Laravel) that can serve as a template to start off any project</li><li>Gain insight on which details are important to a project’s success and how to acquire the necessary knowledge </li></ul><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>Ideal for for frontend/backend web developers, devops engineers, Laravel framework lovers and PHP developers hoping to learn more about either Domain Driven Design or the possibilities with the Laravel framework.

But performance has been an issue for distributed systems like Hadoop, especially when the use cases of a single cluster become multi-tenant or multi-workload. The worst part? You may not even know you have a performance issue. <br/><br/>In this report, Chad Carson and Sean Suchter from Pepperdata describe the performance challenges of running multi-tenant distributed computing environments, especially within a Hadoop context. After examining pros and cons of current solutions for these problems, you’ll learn how to use real-time, intelligent software that tracks and dynamically adjusts each application’s usage of physical hardware. Get ahead of your Hadoop operations for faster, better decision-making and faster, better business returns.<br/><br/>With this report, you’ll explore:</p><ul><li>How Hadoop and other multi-tenant distributed systems work, and why performance matters</li><li>Business-visible symptoms of performance problems: late jobs, inconsistent runtimes, and underutilized hardware</li><li>Scheduling challenges in multi-tenant systems</li><li>Symptoms and solutions for CPU performance limitations</li><li>Physical and virtual limits of node memory—and what happens when you run out</li><li>Identifying and solving performance problems due to disk and network performance limits and other typical bottlenecks</li><li>Solutions for monitoring performance and accurately allocating cluster costs among users and business units</li></ul></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><b>Thoroughly revised and expanded to help readers systematically increase their knowledge and insight about Sigma-Delta Modulators</b></p><p>Sigma-Delta Modulators (SDMs) have become one of the best choices for the implementation of analog/digital interfaces of electronic systems integrated in CMOS technologies. Compared to other kinds of Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs), Σ∆Ms cover one of the widest conversion regions of the resolution-versus-bandwidth plane, being the most efficient solution to digitize signals in an increasingly number of applications, which span from high-resolution low-bandwidth digital audio, sensor interfaces, and instrumentation, to ultra-low power biomedical systems and medium-resolution broadband wireless communications.</p><p>Following the spirit of its first edition, <i>Sigma-Delta Converters: Practical Design Guide, 2nd Edition</i> takes a comprehensive look at SDMs, their diverse types of architectures, circuit techniques, analysis synthesis methods, and CAD tools, as well as their practical design considerations. It compiles and updates the current research reported on the topic, and explains the multiple trade-offs involved in the whole design flow of Sigma-Delta Modulators—from specifications to chip implementation and characterization. The book follows a <i>top-down </i>approach in order to provide readers with the necessary understanding about recent advances, trends, and challenges in state-of-the-art Σ∆Ms. It makes more emphasis on two key points, which were not treated so deeply in the first edition:</p><ul><li>It includes a more detailed explanation of Σ∆Ms implemented using Continuous-Time (CT) circuits, going from system-level synthesis to practical circuit limitations.</li><li>It provides more practical case studies and applications, as well as a deeper description of the synthesis methodologies and CAD tools employed in the design of Σ∆ converters.</li></ul><p><i>Sigma-Delta Converters: Practical Design Guide, 2nd Edition</i> serves as an excellent textbook for undergraduate and graduate students in electrical engineering as well as design engineers working on SD data-converters, who are looking for a uniform and self-contained reference in this hot topic. With this goal in mind, and based on the feedback received from readers, the contents have been revised and structured to make this new edition a unique monograph written in a didactical, pedagogical, and intuitive style. </p></span>",

This sneaks up on you and can leave you without the skills to adequately understand, engage with, and lead your team—which inevitably has a negative effect on your team, and this effect is multiplied as you scale. What if you could reach into the toolbox you use to understand technical problems—software architecture and distributed systems theory—to understand your team? Could you learn to better manage people?</p><p>Andrew Harvey (Microsoft) explores the dynamics of teams and how they map to your understanding of distributed systems. Using this understanding, you can apply distributed systems theory to help unpack some of the dynamics of your team and optimize them for scale. From communication to culture, Andrew breaks down the components of the distributed system, explaining what makes it tick, using things like CAP theorem and the eight fallacies of distributed systems. You’ll walk away with some tools to help understand your team and set yourself up for successful scaling.</p><p>This session was recorded at the 2019 O'Reilly Velocity Conference in San Jose.</p></div></span></span>",

However, shore-based VFDs often are unsuitable for shipboard applications because the power generation and distribution fundamentals are completely different. <i>VFD Challenges for Shipboard Electrical Power System Design</i> explores the problems presented by variable frequency drives as they are applied in shipboard power generation and distribution system design and offers solutions for meeting these challenges.</p><p>VFDs with configurations such as six pulse drive, 12 pulse drive, 18 pulse drive, active front end, pulse width modulation and many others generate many different levels of harmonics. These harmonics are often much higher than the regulations allow. This book covers a range of techniques used to provide ships with efficient energy that minimizes mechanical and electrical stress.

This book describes middleware from two different perspectives: from the viewpoint of the systems programmer and from the viewpoint of the applications programmer. It focuses on the use of open source solutions for creating middleware and the tools for developing distributed applications. The design principles presented are universal and apply to all middleware platforms, including CORBA and Web Services. The authors have created an open-source implementation of CORBA, called MICO, which is freely available on the web. MICO is one of the most successful of all open source projects and is widely used by demanding companies and institutions, and has also been adopted by many in the Linux community.<br/><br/>* Provides a comprehensive look at the architecture and design of middlewarethe bridge that connects distributed software applications<br/>* Includes a complete, commercial-quality open source middleware system written in C++<br/>* Describes the theory of the middleware standard CORBA as well as how to implement a design using open source techniques\n</span>",

With each iteration, you make optimizations—small and large—that can have a huge impact on your application’s speed, size, resilience, and maintainability.</p><p>In <strong>Seriously Good Software: Code that Works, Survives, and Wins</strong>, author, teacher, and Java expert Marco Faella teaches you techniques for writing better code. You’ll start with a simple application and follow it through seven careful refactorings, each designed to explore another dimension of quality.</p><h3>about the technology</h3><p>Great code blends the skill of a programmer with the time-tested techniques and best practices embraced by the entire development community. Although each application has its own context and character, some dimensions of quality are always important. This book concentrates on seven pillars of seriously good software: speed, memory usage, reliability, readability, thread safety, generality, and elegance. The Java-based examples demonstrate techniques that apply to any OO language.</p><h3>about the book</h3><p><strong>Seriously Good Software</strong> is a handbook for any professional developer serious about improving application quality. It explores fundamental dimensions of code quality by enhancing a simple implementation into a robust, professional-quality application. Questions, exercises, and Java-based examples ensure you’ll get a firm grasp of the concepts as you go.

    "description": "<span><div><p>The wish lists of many data-driven organizations seem reasonable enough. They’d like to capitalize on real-time data analysis, move beyond batch processing for time-critical insights, allow multiple users to share cluster resources, and provide predictable service levels. However, fundamental performance limitations of complex distributed systems such as Hadoop prevent much of this from happening.</p><p>In this report, Courtney Webster examines the root cause of these performance problems and explains why best practices for mitigating them—cluster tuning, provisioning, and even cluster isolation for mission critical jobs—don’t provide viable, scalable, or long-term solutions.</p><p>Organizations have been pushing Hadoop and other distributed systems to their performance breaking points as they seek to use clusters as shared resources across multiple business units and individual users. Once they hit this performance wall, companies will find it difficult to deliver on the big data promise at scale.</p><p>Read this report to find out what the implications are for your organization.</p></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p><i>Object-Oriented Python (OOP)</i> is a paradigm that combines data and code into cohesive units, allowing you to think differently about computational problems and solve them in a highly reusable way. Aimed at intermediate-level programmers, <i>Object-Oriented Python</i> is a hands-on tutorial that goes deep into the core tenets of OOP, showing you how to use encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance to write games and apps using Python.</p><p>The book begins by demonstrating key problems inherent in procedural programming, then guides you through the basics of creating classes and objects in Python. You’ll build on this groundwork by developing buttons, text fields, and other GUI elements that are standard in event-driven environments. You’ll also use many real-world code examples and two pygame-based packages to help turn theory into practice, enabling you to easily write interactive games and applications complete with GUI widgets, animations, multiple scenes, and reusable game logic. In the final chapter, you’ll bring it all together by building a fully functional video game that incorporates many of the OOP techniques and GUI elements covered in the book.</p><p>You’ll learn how to:</p><p>•Create and manage multiple objects using an object manager object<br/>•Use encapsulation to hide the inner details of objects from client code<br/>•Use polymorphism to define one interface and implement it in multiple classes<br/>•Apply inheritance to build on existing code</p><p><i>Object-Oriented Python</i> is a visual, intuitive guide to fully understanding how OOP operates and how you can use it to make your code more maintainable, readable, and efficient—without sacrificing functionality.</p></div></span>",

Meeting that need, <strong>Distributed Photovoltaic Grid Transformers</strong> begins by explaining the basic theory behind transformers in the solar power arena, and then progresses to describe the development, manufacture, and sale of distributed photovoltaic (PV) grid transformers, which help boost the electric DC voltage (generally at 30 volts) harnessed by a PV panel to a higher level (generally at 115 volts or higher) once it is inverted to the AC voltage form by the inverter circuit.</p><p>Packed with real-life scenarios and case studies from around the globe, <strong>Distributed Photovoltaic Grid Transformers </strong>covers the key design, operation, and maintenance aspects of transformers suitable for solar energy. Topics include islanding, voltage flicker, voltage operating range, frequency and power factor variation, and waveform distortion. Multiple homework questions are featured in each chapter.

    "title": "Friction-Induced Vibrations and Self-Organization",
    "description": "<span><p>Many scientists and engineers do not realize that, under certain conditions, friction can lead to the formation of new structures at the interface, including <em>in situ</em> tribofilms and various patterns. In turn, these structures—usually formed by destabilization of the stationary sliding regime—can lead to the reduction of friction and wear. <strong>Friction-Induced Vibrations and Self-Organization: Mechanics and Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics of Sliding Contact </strong>combines the mechanical and thermodynamic methods in tribology, thus extending the field of mechanical friction-induced vibrations to non-mechanical instabilities and self-organization processes at the frictional interface. The book also relates friction-induced self-organization to novel biomimetic materials, such as self-lubricating, self-cleaning, and self-healing materials. </p><p><strong><em>Explore Friction from a Different Angle—as a Fundamental Force of Nature</em></strong></p><p>The book begins with an exploration of friction as a fundamental force of nature throughout the history of science. It then introduces general concepts related to vibrations, instabilities, and self-organization in the bulk of materials and at the interface. After presenting the principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics as they apply to the interface, the book formulates the laws of friction and highlights important implications. The authors also analyze wear and lubrication. They then turn their attention to various types of friction-induced vibration, and practical situations and applications where these vibrations are important. The final chapters consider various types of friction-induced self-organization and how these effects can be used for novel self-lubricating, self-cleaning, and self-healing materials.</p><p><strong><em>From Frictional Instabilities to Friction-Induced Self-Organization</em></strong></p><p>Drawing on the authors’ original research, this book presents a new, twenty-first century perspective on friction and tribology. It shows how friction-induced instabilities and vibrations can lead to self-organized structures, and how understanding the structure–property relationships that lead to self-organization is key to designing \"smart\" biomimetic materials.</p></span>",

The truth is that our healthcare system is a sprawling mix of competing interests in which those of the patient are valued least. Too much discussion has devolved to simplistic scapegoating, and too few comprehensive, constructive solutions have been offered. It’s time for a fresh vision.<br/><br/>In straightforward language, <strong>Healthcare at a Turning Point: A Roadmap for Change</strong> outlines a new market-based business model that aligns industry financing mechanisms with the goals of prevention, improved quality, and reduced costs. Drawing on more than 25 years of cross-industry consulting experience, the authors:</p><ul><li>Articulate a market-based vision of the industry</li><li>Examine past efforts to reduce costs, their failures and their unanticipated consequences</li><li>Spotlight perverse incentives that distort the way the healthcare system operates and make it less than it could be</li><li>Present concrete recommendations for change within the healthcare delivery, insurance, pharmaceutical, device and diagnostics sectors</li><li>Explain the changes that employers, consumers and policy makers can make to create a more customer-responsive system that delivers more value</li></ul><p>For all the uncertainty in the current environment, there is also a rare opportunity to fundamentally redefine who wins in this market. <strong>Healthcare at a Turning Point</strong> provides guidance to executives ready for that contest as well as a roadmap for change.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>Recent advances in technology have led to the unprecedented accuracy in measurements of endogenous electric fields around sites of tissue disruption. State-of-the-art molecular approaches demonstrate the role of bioelectricity in the directionality and speed of cell migration, proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and orientation. New information indicates that electric fields play a role in initiating and coordinating complex regenerative responses in development and wound repair and that they may also have a part in cancer progression and metastasis.</p><p/><p>Compiling current research in this rapidly expanding field, <strong>Physiology of Bioelectricity in Development, Tissue Regeneration, and Cancer </strong>highlights relevant, cutting-edge topics poised to drive the next generation of medical breakthroughs. Chapters consider methods for detecting endogenous electric field gradients and studying applied electric fields in the lab. The book addresses bioelectricity’s roles in guiding cell behavior during morphogenesis and orchestrating higher order patterning. It also covers the response of stem cells to applied electric fields, which reveals bioelectricity as an exciting new player in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.</p><p/><p>This book provides an in-depth exploration of how electric signals control corneal wound repair and skin re-epithelialization, angiogenesis, and inflammation. It also delves into the bioelectric responses of cells derived from the musculoskeletal system, bioelectrical guidance of neurons, and the beneficial application of voltage gradients to promote regeneration in the spinal cord. It concludes with a discussion of bioelectricity and cancer progression and the potential for novel cancer biomarkers, new methods for early detection, and bioelectricity-based therapies to target both the tumor and metastatic cancer cells.</p><p/><p>This multidisciplinary compilation will benefit biologists, biochemists, biomedical scientists, engineers, dermatologists, and clinicians, or anyone else interested in development, regeneration, cancer, and tissue engineering. It can also serve as an ideal textbook for students in biology, medicine, medical physiology, biophysics, and biomedical engineering.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><strong>5+ Hours of Video Instruction</strong><br/><br/>\nJava was introduced to the open-source community more than 20 years ago, and it remains popular among developers. However, we now live in a world dominated by the cloud, mobile, IoT, and open source, where containers, Kubernetes, microservices, reactive, and cloud-native application development can deliver higher levels of productivity and efficiency. That's where OOP concepts take center stage, and what Caleb concentrates on in this LiveLessons.\n<br/>\n<strong>Description</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n  In <strong>Object-Oriented Programming with Java LiveLessons</strong>, Caleb Curry provides the foundational instruction on OOP design principles and concepts, applying them in Java, so that programmers can overcome the challenges of starting or moving to OOP. Because modern languages are designed for scalability, Caleb describes how to think about coding with scalability in mind. He introduces classes, objects, methods, fields, access modifiers, encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.\n<br/>\n\nHe also covers some of the best practices around exception handling in the context of object-oriented programming for Java up through Java SE 14.\n<br/>\n<strong>About the Instructor</strong>\n<strong>Caleb Curry</strong> has taught thousands of people programming principles through his YouTube channel and social channels. He works with numerous programming languages and has developed a following and reputation as a guru in coding and technology. His simple approach to teaching delights audiences of 190,000 subscribers on YouTube. He also produces courses with Pearson (<em>Getting Started with MongoDB and NoSQL LiveLessons</em>) and has been featured in <em>Forbes</em>.\nWebsite: http://calebcurry.com<br/>\nYouTube: https://youtube.com/calebthevideomaker2<br/>\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/calebcurry\n<strong>Skill Level</strong><br/>\n<ul><li>Beginning to Intermediate</li></ul>\n<br/>\n<strong>What You Will Learn</strong><br/>\n<ul><li>Learn the common terminology of object-oriented programming</li><li>Develop example code for the main keywords</li><li>Learn how the Java language is structured to build code to your full potential</li><li>Build Java applications that use object-oriented principles</li><li>Learn to encapsulate data using various Java keywords</li><li>Design an inheritance hierarchy and implement it in code</li><li>Understand polymorphism and how to get the most from your inheritance hierarchy</li><li>Conquer the vast number of access modifiers to ensure the integrity of your code</li></ul>\n<br/>\n<strong>Who Should Take This Course</strong><br/>\n<ul><li>Programmers</li><li>Developers (getting started with OOP concepts, but aware of programming in general)</li></ul>\n<br/>\n<strong>Course Requirements</strong>\nPrerequisites:<br/>\n<ul><li>Familiarity with the key concepts of programming, such as variables, loops, and functions</li><li>Basic understanding of Java</li></ul>\n<br/>\n<strong>About Pearson Video Training<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n  Pearson publishes expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

Rather than defining each and everything individually, in OOP, we create objects and recall them whenever needed. This also makes a code compact and easily accessible. This course will teach you about OOP and how to write codes using OOP. We will learn this with Java Enterprise Edition.  </p>\n\n<p>This course starts your journey by refreshing your knowledge of basic OOP concepts and how to implement them in real Java code. Once you understand the concepts and how to implement them, we’ll look at more advanced OOP topics that will help you write professional code that is easy to test and easy to extend. You also get to learn many concepts of how a program operates complex concepts in OOP. What’s more? You will also get to know about JavaBeans and Spring. </p>\n\n<p>By the end of this course, you will have mastered OOP and will be able to write the codes like a pro. You will also have gathered a good knowledge of Java EE, spring, JavaBeans and so much more!</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Ajax is taking us into the next generation of web applications. Ajax has broken the client-server barrier by decoupling the client from the server, but an Ajax application still needs a server to extract content from. The most effective use of Ajax and the server requires an understanding of REST, an architectural style used to define Web services.</p><p><i>Ajax Patterns and Best Practices</i> explores dynamic web applications that combine Ajax and REST as a single solution. A major advantage of REST is that, like Ajax, it can be used with today's existing technologies.</p><p>This is an ideal book whether or not you have already created an Ajax application. Because the book outlines various patterns and best practices, you can quickly check and verify that you're building an efficient Ajax application.</p><p>Inside the book, the patterns will answer the following questions:</p><ul><li><p>What is Ajax, and REST, and why do you even care? And if I should care what are some examples of websites that make effective use of Ajax and REST?</p></li><li><p>What are the absolute basics of Ajax and REST and what parts of those basics should I use?</p></li><li><p>How should deal with large amounts of data? Should I cache the data? Should I get the data piece fed to me? (Patterns: Cache Controller, and Infinite Data)</p></li><li><p>People keep telling me that sessions and cookies are bad? Are they bad? What should I do? And while I think about how about generating content for other devices? (Permutations pattern)</p></li><li><p>I want to fix the back-button problem of the HTML browser.

Learn simple, powerful OOP techniques that will have a big impact on your programming.</p><p><b>About This Video</b></p><ul><li>Gain a wholesome overview of OOP in Java through this interactive and engaging course</li><li>Understand the OOP principles and the common developer patterns</li><li>Get unique recipes in Java that will help you integrate seamlessly with built-in features and the standard library</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Writing large programs can be painful. Objects created for object-oriented programs can easily be reused in other programs, saving man hours of coding in the long run by writing code in a smarter way. This course teaches you object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java, in an engaging and interactive way.</p><p>It will show you the object-oriented principles in Java and the best techniques. You’ll start by building objects and classes. Then you’ll learn about Constructors and Deconstructors to call and kill your objects. Further on, you’ll find out about different types of Inheritance and how they are dependent on objects. After that, you’ll learn Polymorphism to process objects differently based on their data types and Abstraction techniques to hide data from a user. Next you’ll learn about exception methods and error handling for efficient coding. Finally, you’ll also learn about Encapsulation with methods and variables to keep the data and the code safe from external interference.</p><p>By the end of the course, you’ll be well-versed with the OOP techniques in Java, which will help you write code better and in a more efficient manner.</p><p>The code bundle for this video course is available at - <a href=\"https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-on-Object-Oriented-Programming-with-Java-11\">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-on-Object-Oriented-Programming-with-Java-11</a></p><p>Downloading the example code for this course: You can download the example code files for all Packt video courses you have purchased from your account at <a href=\"http://www.PacktPub.com\">http://www.PacktPub.com</a>.

    "title": "Architecture as code: Objective measures of value in a changing world",
    "description": "<span><span><div><p>The idea that architecture can support change was described by Neal Ford, Rebecca Parsons, and Pat Kua in 2017 as evolutionary architecture. How do we enable this kind of evolution?</p><p>Architectural goals and constraints change independently of functional expectations. Fitness functions describe how close an architecture is to achieving an objective goal. During test-driven development, we write tests to verify that features conform to desired business outcomes; we can also write fitness functions that measure and monitor a system’s alignment to architectural goals as they evolve.</p><p>In order for technology to deliver lasting business value, it must be adaptable. Prose enterprise architecture standards or rigid architecture frameworks often don’t have the flexibility to support constant change. Regardless of application architectures (monolith, microservices, microkernel, etc.) or business architecture, fitness function–driven development can introduce continuous feedback for architectural conformance and inform the development process as it happens rather than after the fact.</p><p>Architecture can be expressed and tested as code, in a pipeline, in the same way we express and test business capability and infrastructure as code. The concept of architecture as code is a tremendous leap for most traditional architecture and development teams, challenging long-standing perceptions and mindsets.</p><p>Paula Paul and Cassandra Shum (ThoughtWorks) share adventures in the enterprise as they take architects and engineers on a journey toward fitness function–driven development, with real-world hurdles and unexpected insights, as they rethink the connection between architecture and business value in a digital world.</p></div></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p>\nThis unique book offers a vendor-neutral approach for designing\nlarge local area networks according to business or organizational\nneeds, rather than from a product perspective. Author and\nindependent network design consultant Kevin Dooley outlines\n\"top-down network design\" for building a technological\ninfrastructure to fit your organization's requirements, a process\nfar more effective and cost-efficient than fitting the organization\nto the parameters of a shrink-wrapped proprietary solution. Dooley\nargues that the design of a network is largely independent of the\nproducts used. Whether you use a Cisco or Juniper router, the same\nsecurity issues and protocols apply. The questions he addresses in\nthis book are need-specific: Do I use a router or a switch? Should\nI route between switched areas or switch between routed areas?\n<em>Designing Large-Scale LANs</em> covers everything from security,\nbandwidth and scalability to network reliability, which includes\nbackup, redundancy, and points of failure. Specific technologies\nare analyzed in detail: network topologies, routing and switching\nstrategies, wireless, virtual LANs, firewalls and gateways,\nsecurity, Internet protocols, bandwidth, and multicast services.\nThe book also discusses proprietary technologies that are\nubiquitous, such as Cisco's IOS and Novell's IPX. This complete\nguide to top-down network design will help you choose the right\nnetwork solutions. If you're designing large scale networks and\nneed expert advice and guidance, look no further than <em>Designing\nLarge-Scale LANs</em>.\n</p></span></span></span>",

It illustrates the design process using proven patterns that address complex business/technical scenarios, where integrated concepts of service-oriented architecture (SOA), Business Process Management (BPM), and Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) are required. The book demonstrates that SOA is not limited to technical issues but instead, is a holistic challenge where aspects of SOA, EDA, and BPM must be addressed together. An ideal guide for SOA solution architects, designers, developers, managers, and students about to enter the field, the book: Provides an accessible introduction to basic and more advanced concepts in process-driven SOA Illustrates how to manage the complexities of business aligned IT architectures with detailed examples and industry cases Outlines a step-by-step design process using proven patterns to address complex business/ technical scenarios Integrates SOA, BPM, and EDA into practical patterns promoting SOA 2.0 Describing how to synchronize parallel enterprise processes, the authors explain how to cope with the architectural and design decisions you are likely to encounter when designing and implementing process-driven SOA systems. The decisions are described in the form of software patterns to provide you with a practical guideline for addressing key problems using time-tested solutions.</p></span>",
