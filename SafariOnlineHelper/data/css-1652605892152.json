You also want to do it right so you can actually maintain and expand your web pages over time so they work in all browsers and mobile devices. Oh, and if you've never heard of CSS, that's okay--we won't tell anyone you're still partying like it's 1999--but if you're going to create web pages in the 21st century then you'll want to know and understand CSS.<br/><br/>Learn the real secrets of creating web pages, and why everything your boss told you about HTML tables is probably wrong (and what to do instead).

Best of all, you'll learn HTML and CSS in a way that won't put you to sleep. If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect: a visually-rich format designed for the way your brain works.

The book can be read cover to cover, with each chapter building on the previous one. However it can equally be used as a reference book, dipping into each chapter or technique to help solve specific problems.</p><p>This second edition contains:</p><ul><li><p>New examples and updated browser support information</p></li><li><p>New case studies from Simon Collison and Cameron Moll</p></li><li><p>CSS3 examples, showing new CSS3 features, and CSS3 equivalents to tried and tested CSS2 techniques</p></li></ul><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><ul><li><p>The best practice concepts in CSS design.</p></li><li><p>The most important (and tricky) parts of CSS</p></li><li><p>Identify and fix the most common CSS problems</p></li><li><p>How to deal with the most common bugs</p></li><li><p>Completely up to date browser support information</p></li><li><p>Covers CSS3 as well as CSS2 showing you the future of CSS</p></li></ul><p><b>Who is this book for?</b></p><p>This book will be aimed towards intermediate web designers/developers although the examples should be simple enough for novice designers/developers with a basic understanding of CSS to follow along with. Readers will probably have read beginner/intermediate instructional books such as Web Standards Solutions and will be looking for more practical and in-depth information. This book is likely to have a broad appeal, attracting intermediate developers wanting to improve their skills as well as advanced developers wanting a useful reference.</p><p>The CSS 2/3 content of the book is delivered in a way that allows readers to learn CSS2 techniques that they can implement now in professional work, and then gem up on CSS3 techniques if desired, if they want to start looking towards the future.</p></span>",

    "title": "HTML5 & CSS3 Fundamentals LiveLessons (Sneak Peek Video Training)",
    "description": "<span><span><p>This video consists of over 18 hours of instruction. The\nvideo assumes that you know basic JavaScript. Advanced techniques\nare taught in the video.\n<br/>\n<br/>You start by learning the basics of HTML5, then cover more\nsophisticated techniques such as creating tables, creating forms\nfor collecting user input and using new features in HTML5,\nincluding page-structure elements that enable you to give meaning\nto the parts of a page (e.g., headers, navigation areas, footers,\nsections, figures, figure captions and more). Then you move on to\nthe canvas element, which provides a JavaScript application\nprogramming interface (API) with methods for drawing\ntwo-dimensional bitmapped graphics and animations, manipulating\nfonts and images, and inserting images and videos.\n<br/>\n<br/>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to specify the\npresentation, or styling, of elements on a web page (e.g., fonts,\nspacing, sizes, colors, positioning). CSS was designed to style\nportable web pages independently of their content and structure. By\nseparating page styling from page content and structure, you can\neasily change the look and feel of the pages on an entire website,\nor a portion of a website, simply by swapping out one style sheet\nfor another. CSS3 is the current version of CSS under development.\nYou learn CSS basics, then you go on to the key new features in\nCSS3, including text and box shadows, transitions, transformations,\nanimations, multicolumn layouts and more.\n<br/>\n<br/>Finally, you learn about two new important HTML5\ntechnologies: Web Workers and WebSockets. When a browser executes a\nlong-running script, the browser typically becomes unresponsive for\na period of time and sometimes displays an alert indicating that\nthe script is busy or might have stopped working. This leads to a\npoor user experience. Web Workers enable portions of tasks to be\noff-loaded to background threads, allowing a web app’s GUI to\nremain responsive at all times. WebSockets enable clients to send\ndata to and receive data from servers simultaneously using a\npersistent connection between the client and the server. In a web\napp with frequently updated data, the client typically polls the\nserver repeatedly to get more data. With an open WebSocket\nconnection, however, the server can push data to the client without\nthe client specifically making additional requests, resulting in a\nmore responsive app.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>About the Author:</b>\n<br/>Paul Deitel, CEO and Chief Technical Officer of Deitel &amp;\nAssociates, Inc., is a graduate of MIT’s Sloan School of\nManagement, where he studied Information Technology.

You'll find everything you need to start creating awesome web designs and layouts with Flexbox code/syntaxes in this course. You won't have to look anywhere else.</li><li>We strongly advocate learning by doing, rather than just listening or reading. Our lectures are filled with a wealth of examples that explain every concept clearly.</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Before Flexbox arrived on the screen, we had to use relative or absolute positioning, floats clears and 100s of lines of code to achieve a decent website layout. All of that's changed now. With CSS Flexbox, you can layout your website's design in just a few lines of code, and even make it responsive! No more frameworks like Bootstrap to make up for the shortcomings in CSS. Become a professional web designer in just a few hours. If you know the very basics of HTML and CSS, you're all set. Spend a few hours learning a bunch of Flexbox syntaxes, and you'll be creating awesome web layouts in no time at all! You don't need to learn a bunch of frameworks to become a pro web designer now! We'll be using a real-world example to explain the concepts.</p><p>All the code and supporting files for this course are available at: https://github.com/PacktPublishing/A-Complete-CSS-Flexbox-Course-and-a-Real-World-Website-Project</p></span>",

Flexible box layout, often called Flexbox, frees you from the challenges of creating layouts with floats and padding and lets you specify containers and their contents instead. The new model means you can specify the directions in which material flows, how content wraps, and the ways components can expand to fill a space. Whether you've been creating large sites or small, fixed sites or responsive sites, flexbox will simplify your work.</p></span>",

They will learn not\nonly how to build a liquid layout from scratch using\nstandards-compliant and cross-browser compatible (X)HTML and CSS,\nbut will also learn how to design and slice their graphic comps in\na way that makes flexible design achievable. This book will show\ndesigners that flexible layouts do not have to be visually boring\nor difficult to build when planned and built correctly. Even those\nwho do not intend to build liquid layouts can use the concepts and\ntechniques taught in this book to improve their fixed-width CSS\ndesigns, because they will learn how to design for the inherent\nflexibility of the web medium, instead of the rigid qualities of\nprint media or table grid-based layouts.</p></span></span>",

The last thing many of them want to do is to\ntranslate their work into mono-spaced tags and numbers, divs and\nids. But print designers can't ignore the web and producing a\ndesign for the web has become a common part of a complete graphics\npackage. And, knowing the basics of CSS is an essential ingredient\nfor success.<br/>\n <br/>\nCSS for Print Designers presents web design concepts using\nmetaphors that make sense to visual designers. Instead of using\nterms like semantics and structure, the book simplifies the\nlanguage of web design using metaphors that print designers are\ncomfortable with such as grouping like items or sculpting a layout\nfrom top to bottom or even how using sprites with CSS is like\nimporting and cropping images in InDesign. The book uses efficient\nuse of space with supporting graphics that demonstrate complex\nconcepts such as nesting tags, clearing floats, and creating\nsprites.<br/><br/></p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>This book teaches web designers how to use HTML, CSS, and\nJavaScript to build native iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad\napplications.  By leveraging their existing skills, web\ndesigners can do the same specialized and content-specific work for\nnew platforms. And by combining these skills with a code framework\nthat allows them to bypass the need to learn a lot of Objective-C\nprogramming, web designers can focus exclusively on interface and\ncontent design. This results in better products for clients and\ntheir customers, and also saves the designer both time (by avoiding\nthe need to learn - or subcontract for - unnecessary programming\nskills) and money (by avoiding the use of more expensive - but less\ncustomizable - software-based approaches to designing native\napps).</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>​Leverage various CSS features in combination with popular architectures in order to bring your style sheets back under your control. While CSS is the primary technology used for building beautiful web user interfaces, the style sheet files themselves are often quite ugly; left chaotic and unstructured through lack of a consistent architectural approach. By addressing the structure of your style sheets in the same way that you do with code, see how it is possible to create style rules that are clean and easy to read. Dig deep into CSS fundamentals and learn how to use the available selectors to build powerful rules.</p><p>You will learn how to use cascading, inheritance, pseudo-classes, pre-processors, and components to produce cleaner, DRY-er style sheets, and how to let these features work for you instead of leading you down the road of rule duplication and design inconsistencies. Embrace the clean, semantic HTML to make your code easier to read, while supporting accessibility and assistive technologies.</p><p>Separate the concerns of layout and style to simplify dynamic theming and white labeling, making you a marketing hero. Once you've finished this book you will have an advanced knowledge of CSS structures and architectural patterns that will take the pain out of style sheets for you (and your coworkers), and help you implement designs faster and easier than ever before.</p><p><b>What You'll Learn</b></p><ul><li>Understand the core CSS fundamentals of Inheritance, Cascading, and Specificity</li><li>Work with architecture and design patterns for better organization and maintenance<br/></li><li>Maximize code reuse with CSS precompilers</li><li>Review the strengths and weaknesses of popular architecture patterns</li></ul><div></div><p></p><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p></p><p>Primarily for front-end web developers and UI designers and anyone who works with CSS, particularly if they find it cumbersome and inelegant.

Components are the fundamental building block of a modern application, and with CSS in JS we can finally bring our style to the component age. <b>CSS in JavaScript: With styled-components and React</b> is a video course that unites the best parts of ES2015, React, and of course, CSS to bring real benefits to your styling solution!</p><br/>\nabout the subject<br/>\n<p>Web development has changed. CSS was originally designed for styling documents, with the web as a mere document reader. We’ve now re-purposed the web with components at the core. CSS just wasn’t built with component-based development in mind, but there’s a solution! Combining the best parts of CSS, components, and JavaScript together, CSS in JS unifies these two separate methodologies, letting you write your CSS directly in your JavaScript files. That means you can have your CSS interact directly on the component level.<br/>\nMore importantly, you get to enjoy a whole host of benefits like cleaner code, more intuitive styles, automatic vendor prefixing, and much more. With this approach, you get to continue to write the real CSS, not inline styles, but in a way that’s suited for modern applications!</p><br/>\nabout the video<br/>\n<p><b>CSS in JavaScript: With styled-components and React</b> introduces you to developing modern applications that include CSS written directly in your JavaScript files, rather than as separate stylesheets. Taking on something this new can be daunting, but expert instructor Dustin Schau brings his wealth of experience on CSS in JS with lessons that will let you digest what you learn easily. After starting with a brief introduction to CSS in JS and what it actually means, you’ll quickly start using React and the library styled-components to build your first styled component. You’ll see how to inject props, grapple with inheritance, and get to grips with all sorts of pseudo styles, media queries, and cool animations.<br/>\nThen, with real-world exercises you can bring to your own work, you’ll focus on extending your creations with advanced features like server-side rendering, theming support, and even a brief segue into CSS modules and automated tooling. Top everything off with a look at when not to use CSS in JS, and you’ll be ready to use the skills and techniques you’ve picked up right away!</p>\n  </span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Learn all the CSS Grid concepts and create professional responsive website designs - multiple website layout projects.</p><p><b>About This Video</b></p><ul><li>We like to be thorough in our teaching. You'll find everything you need to start creating awesome web designs and layouts with Flexbox code/syntaxes in this course. You won't have to look anywhere else.</li><li>We strongly advocate learning by doing, rather than just listening or reading. Our lectures are filled with a wealth of examples that explain every concept clearly.</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>By applying the concepts you learn in this course, you can code and design.</p><p>Here are the modules:</p><p>Module 1 - CSS Grid property - This is the foundation's module. We’ll look at how to make an element a Grid container so that its child items can be manipulated. We'll also look at what Grid items are and their significance. In this module, we'll be looking into how to create grid columns and rows and how they can be used to layout the website elements in simple ways.</p><p>Module 2 - Grid lines - In this module, we’ll look at a very important concept - Grid lines. This concept can be used to create full blown websites that are placed on 2 dimensional grid lines (hence the name). We'll look at how to use grid lines to create website layouts, and then we'll create 2 website layout projects using Grid lines as well. We'll also look into how to align grid items or the website's elements using the various Grid alignment properties.</p><p>Module 3 - Grid Areas - In this module, we'll look at yet another important concept - Grid areas. We'll look at how we can use grid areas to create complicated website layouts much easier than grid lines. We'll be looking at 2 more website layout projects in this module.</p><p>Module 4 - Create a website - real-world project (nonresponsive and responsive) - In this module, you'll learn how to create a simple, 2-column business website, one that looks like most of the small business HTML websites out there. You'll also learn how to make it completely responsive.</p><p>All the codes and supporting files for this course are available at: <a href=\"https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Practice-CSS-Grid-Projects-to-Build-Modern-Real-World-Websites\">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Practice-CSS-Grid-Projects-to-Build-Modern-Real-World-Websites</a></p><p>Downloading the example code for this course: You can download the example code files for all Packt video courses you have purchased from your account at <a href=\"http://www.PacktPub.com\">http://www.PacktPub.com</a>.

    "title": "Modern CSS with Tailwind",
    "description": "<span><div><p>Tailwind CSS is an exciting new CSS framework that allows you to design your site by composing simple utility classes to create complex effects. With Tailwind, you can style your text, move your items on the page, design complex page layouts, and adapt your design for devices from a phone to a wide-screen monitor. With this book, you'll learn how to use the Tailwind for its flexibility and its consistency, from the smallest detail of your typography to the entire design of your site.</p><p>With CSS, you can do amazing things to the basic text and images on your website, and with just a little bit of client-side code to add and remove CSS classes, you can do exponentially more. CSS can also be hard to debug, complicated to write, and hard to maintain - Ã??Ã?Âbut it doesn't have to be. With Tailwind, you can minimize the amount of CSS you need to write, making it easier to control and debug, and yet still enjoy full flexibility and consistency across your site. Use Tailwind to build complex page layouts, add responsive design that adjusts to different screen widths, and dramatically reduce the amount of CSS you need.</p><p>The Tailwind setup is extremely explicit, and makes it possible to understand the display just by looking at the HTML markup. Start by designing the typographic details of the individual elements, then placing and manipulating those elements in \"the box\" - the rectangle of space each element takes up on screen - using a flexbox or grid design. Move those elements around the page with helpful small animations and transitions. With Tailwind, it's easy to prototype, iterate, and customize your display. Use prefixes to specify behavior. Change defaults, add new behavior, or integrate with legacy CSS.</p><p>Use Tailwind to make extraordinary web designs without extraordinary effort.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>This book is about Tailwind 2.0. You need to be able to install Ruby on Rails to run the sample app.</p></div></span>",

You no longer use HTML and XHTML as design tools, but strictly as ways to define the meaning and structure of web content. And Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are no longer just something interesting to tinker with, but a reliable method for handling all matters of presentation, from fonts and colors to page layout. When you follow the standards, both the site's design and underlying code are much cleaner. But how do you keep all those HTML and XHTML tags and CSS values straight? </p><p>Jennifer Niederst-Robbins, the author of our definitive guide on standards-compliant design, <i>Web Design in a Nutshell</i>, offers you the perfect little guide when you need answers immediately: <i>HTML and XHTML Pocket Reference</i>. This revised and updated new edition takes the top 20% of vital reference information from her Nutshell book, augments it judiciously, cross-references everything, and organizes it according to the most common needs of web developers. The result is a handy book that offers the bare essentials on web standards in a small, concise format that you can use carry anywhere for quick reference. This guide will literally fit into your back pocket.</p><p>Inside <i>HTML and XHTML Pocket Reference</i>, you'll find instantly accessible alphabetical listings of every element and attribute in the HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 Recommendations. This is an indispensable reference for any serious web designer, author, or programmer who needs a fast on-the-job resource when working with established web standards.</p></div></span></span>",

I'll show you how to write CSS that endures continual iteration, multiple authors, and yet always produces predictable results. Enduring CSS, often referred to as ECSS, offers you a robust and proven approach to authoring and maintaining style sheets at scale.</p><p>Enduring CSS is not a book about writing CSS, as in the stuff inside the curly braces. This is a book showing you how to think about CSS, and be a smarter developer with that thinking! It's about the organisation and architecture of CSS - the parts outside the braces. I will help you think about the aspects of CSS development that become the most difficult part of writing CSS in larger projects.</p><p>You'll learn about the problems of authoring CSS at scale - including specificity, the cascade and styles intrinsically tied to document structure. I'll introduce you to the ECSS methodology, and show you how to develop consistent and enforceable selector naming conventions. We'll cover how to apply ECSS to your web applications and visual model, and how you can organize your project structure wisely, and handle visual state changes with ARIA, providing greater accessibility considerations. In addition, we'll take a deep look into CSS tooling and process considerations. Finally we will address performance considerations by examining topics such as CSS selector speed with hard data and browser-representative insight.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>Learn with me, Ben Frain, about how to really think about CSS. This is a book to deal with writing CSS for large-scale, rapidly changing web projects and applications. This isn't a book about writing CSS, as in the stuff inside the curly braces - this is a book about the organisation and architecture of CSS; the parts outside the braces!</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p><em>Foundation Website Creation with CSS, XHTML, and JavaScript</em> covers the entire process of building a website. This process involves much more than just technical knowledge, and this book provides you with all the information you'll need to understand the concepts behind designing and developing for the Web, as well as the best means to deliver professional, best-practice-based results.</p><p>There is far more to building a successful website than knowing a little Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). The process starts long before any coding takes place, and this book introduces you to the agile development process, explaining why this method makes so much sense for web projects and how best to implement it. Planning is vital, so you'll also learn how to use techniques such as brainstorming, wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to get your project off to the best possible start and help ensure smooth progress as it develops.</p><p>An understanding of correct, semantic markup is essential to any web professional, so this book explains how XHTML should be used to structure content so that the markup adheres to current web standards. You'll learn about the wide range of HTML elements available to you, and you'll learn how and when to use them through building example web pages.</p><p>Without creative use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), websites would all look largely the same. CSS gives you the ability to set your website apart from the rest while maintaining the integrity of your markup. You'll learn how CSS works and how to apply styles to your pages, enabling you to realize your design ideas in the browser.</p><p>JavaScript can be used to make your website easier and more interesting to use. This book provides information on appropriate uses of this technology and introduces the concepts of programming using it. You'll also see how JavaScript works as part of the much-hyped technique Ajax and in turn where Ajax fits into the wider Web 2.0 picture.</p><p>While a website is being built, it needs to be tested across multiple browsers and platforms to ensure that the site works for all users, regardless of ability or disability, and the book explains how best to do these tasks. Then, it discusses the process of launching and maintaining the site so that it will continue to work for all its users throughout its life-cycle.</p><p>The book concludes by covering server-side technologies, acting as a guide to the different options available and explaining differences between available products. With insights from renowned experts such as Jason Fried of 37signals, Daniel Burka of Digg and Pownce, and Chris Messina of Citizen Agency, this book provides invaluable information applicable to every web project, regardless of size, scope, or budget.</p></span></span></span>",

Unlike the old days, when designers cobbled togetherchunky HTML, bandwidth-hogging graphics, and a prayer to make their sites look good,Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) now lets your inner designer come out and play.

Unfortunately, due to CSS's complexity andthe many challenges of building pages that work in all Web browsers, most Web authorstreat CSS as a kind of window-dressing to spruce up the appearance of their sites.Integrating CSS with a site's underlying HTML is hard work, and often frustratinglycomplicated. As a result many of the most powerful features of CSS are left untapped.With this book, beginners and Web-building veterans alike can learn how to navigatethe ins-and-outs of CSS and take complete control over their Web pages'appearance.</p><br/><br/><p>Author David McFarland (the bestselling author of O'Reilly's <i>Dreamweaver: TheMissing Manual</i>) combines crystal-clear explanations, real-world examples, a dashof humor, and dozens of step-by-step tutorials to show you ways to design sites withCSS that work consistently across browsers.

    "description": "<span><p>This book is your indispensable guide to cutting-edge CSS development—all you need to work your way up to CSS professional.</p><p>While CSS is a relatively simple technology to learn, it is a difficult one to master. When you first start developing sites using CSS, you will come across all kinds of infuriating browser bugs and inconsistencies. It sometimes feels like there are a million and one different techniques to master, spread across a bewildering array of websites. The range of possibilities seems endless and makes for a steep and daunting learning curve.</p><p>By bringing all of the latest tips, tricks, and techniques together in one handy reference, this book demystifies the secrets of CSS and makes the journey to CSS mastery as simple and painless as possible. While most books concentrate on basic skills, this one is different, assuming that you already know the basics and why you should be using CSS in your work, and concentrating mainly on advanced techniques.</p><p>It begins with a brief recap of CSS fundamentals such as the importance of meaningful markup, how to structure and maintain your code, and how the CSS layout model really works.</p><p>With the basics out of the way, each subsequent chapter details a particular aspect of CSS-based design. Through a series of easy-to-follow tutorials, you will learn practical CSS techniques you can immediately start using in your daily work. Browser inconsistencies are the thorn in most CSS developers' sides, so we have dedicated two whole chapters to CSS hacks, filters, and bug fixing, as well as looking at image replacement; professional link, form, and list styling; pure CSS layouts; and much more.</p><p>All of these techniques are then put into practice in two beautifully designed case studies, written by two of the world's best CSS designers, <i>Simon Collison</i> and <i>Cameron Moll</i>.</p></span>",

Next you will learn CSS and HTML concepts that are vital to a good Sass workflow. After all, Sass exists to simplify writing CSS, but it won't teach you how to make clean, scalable, reusable CSS. For that, you need to understand some basic concepts of OOCSS, SMACCS, and Atomic Design.</p><p>Once you've brushed up on the important concepts, it's time to write some Sass. Mainly you'll write a few functions and mixins that really leverage control flow using @if / @else loops and you'll learn how to figure out when and why things are going wrong before they bring you to a stop. Moving further, you'll learn how to use @debug, @warn and @error to properly handle errors.</p><p>You'll also learn about Gulp and how to use it to automate your workflow and reduce your repetitive tasks. And finally you'll learn about sourcemaps. With sourcemaps, you'll be able to write, debug, and view your Sass and Compass all from within the browser. It'll even LiveReload too!</p><p>As a bonus, you'll take a look at that funky Flexbox, currently all the rage! You'll learn how powerful and flexible it really is, and how you can use it with Compass. Best of all, it falls back very gracefully indeed! In fact, you'll be able to apply it to any existing project without having to change a line of the original CSS.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This book will provide readers with practical, actionable expertise to enhance their knowledge</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>Get a rapid introduction to Tailwind, the utility-first CSS framework, and start building sites with it today!</p><p>For many years, component-based frameworks, like Bootstrap, were the de facto standard for building websites quickly and easily. But all this magic comes with a price. Without serious customization, sites built with such frameworks look similar to each other. And customization is a real pain in the neck for anyone who wants to build something more complex or creative. Component-based styles are easy to implement, but inflexible and confined to certain boundaries. Solving specificity issues while trying to override the default styles of a particular framework isn't a fun and productive job. Tailwind is a utility-first framework that is built with low-level functionality in mind. As you'll see in this book, utility classes offer much more power and flexibility than component classes. You'll learn:</p><ul><li>Component vs utility classes, and the pros and cons of each</li><li>Tailwind basics (layout, typography, responsive web design, colors, and more)</li><li>Creating your own Tailwind components</li><li>Building complex and flexible layouts with Tailwind's Grid utilities</li><li>Customizing Tailwind</li><li>Working with Tailwind plugins</li><li>And much more!</li></ul></div></span>",

The book uses a tutorial-led approach to demonstrate real-world examples of new techniques, while providing an accessible reference guide for subsequent referral.</p><p><i>Pro CSS3 Layout Techniques</i> teaches you how to make the most of CSS3's existing specification, including those parts of the specification already widely implemented, as well as the upcoming modules that are still being developed by the W3C. After reading this book you'll be able to confidently develop sophisticated, flexible layouts that aren't possible with CSS2.1.</p><p>CSS1 allowed designers to separate content from presentation for the first time and CSS2 cemented support for advanced typographical control, but neither specification provided more than rudimentary layout control. CSS3's latest additions allow designers to craft fully responsive, sophisticated layouts without the need for complex scripts or smoke-and-mirror workarounds.</p><p>CSS3 is still in active development, with browser vendors racing against each other to implement the latest recommendations from the W3C. <i>Pro CSS3 Layout Techniques</i> will help you cut through the waffle and get straight to the heart of what works now, while showing you how to be ready for the future of CSS!</p><p><b>What You'll Learn</b></p><p>Review major CSS3 layout modules including multi-column, regions, and grid</p><p>Speed up your workflow with CSS libraries and frameworks</p><p>Use libraries, frameworks, and polyfills</p><p>Overcome layout challenges of the web</p><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>Web designers and developers</p></span>",

It's not going to show Web designers\neverything there is to know about CSS but rather will provide a\nsolid introduction from which to build their CSS knowledge. The\nbeginning of the book starts with the basics -- rules, selectors,\nclasses, IDs, the cascade, internal and external style sheets,\nDivs, boxes, floats, padding, margins -- everything is covered.\nNext comes styling elements, working with images, menus and\nnavigation, and moving styles from internal to external style\nsheets. Rounding out this project-based guide is working with\nbrowsers, both old and new, and debugging CSS. Succinct and to the\npoint, it's the perfect book for designers without a lot of time\nwho need to understand and start using CSS.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>Cascading style sheets (CSS) are the modern standard for website presentation. When combined with a structural markup language such as HTML, XHTML, or XML (though not limited to these), cascading style sheets provide Internet browsers with the information that enables them to present all the visual aspects of a web document. Cascading style sheets apply things such as borders, spacing between paragraphs, headings or images, control of font faces or font colors, background colors and images, textual effects such as underlined or strike-through text, layering, positioning, and a number of other presentational effects. CSS controls the presentational aspects of a web page's design, whereas HTML, XHTML, or XML controls the structure of a web page, which means little more than determining that certain text is a heading, other text is a paragraph, still other text is a list of hyperlinks, and so on. CSS provides enhanced and precise visual rendering; markup languages such as HTML provide meaning and structure.</p><p><em>Beginning CSS: Cascading Style Sheets for Web Design, Second Edition</em> covers all the details required to combine CSS with HTML, XHTML, or XML to create rich, aesthetically powerful designs. Throughout the book, you'll focus on combining CSS with XHTML specifically because XHTML is the standard hailed by Internet standards bodies as the successor to HTML and the present and future of website design. CSS and XHTML allow a web document to be presented with less code, resulting in a significantly smaller file size and greatly increased ease of maintenance. CSS also enables the presentation of a web document to be centralized, which allows for the look and feel of an entire website to be written and centralized in one or a few simple documents, which makes updating a website a breeze. With only a few simple edits to a single document, the look and feel of an entire website can be completely changed.</p><p>By using modern standards like CSS and XHTML, you can drastically reduce the cost of building and maintaining a website when compared to legacy HTML-only pages. You can also greatly reduce the amount of physical bandwidth and hard disk space required, resulting in immediate long-term benefits for any website.</p><p>This book also discusses how to style XML documents with CSS—XML being a more advanced markup language with multipurpose applications. XML will play an increasingly larger role in the production of XHTML documents in the future.</p><p>This second edition of <em>Beginning CSS</em> features a near-complete overhaul of the content from the first edition. Changes based on what readers had to say about the first edition helped to create the most comprehensive introduction on CSS available on the market. Throughout this book, you see CSS broken down into simple examples that focus on a single concept at a time. This allows you to better understand how and why something works, since you aren't presented with a lot of irrelevant code, and you can better see the bits and pieces that come together that make something work. While these examples may not be particularly pretty, they are extremely valuable learning tools that will help you master cascading style sheets.</p><p>To enhance the learning experience, most of the source code examples are presented in syntax-colored code, a special feature in this book. Syntax coloring is a feature that you commonly see in fancy development software, such as Zend Studio (used to develop PHP), or Microsoft's Visual Studio (used to develop ASP, C#, and so on), and other software used by professional programmers every day. Syntax coloring is used in these software suites to make programming easier and more intuitive, and it offers tremendous benefits in teaching as well. It allows you to see what the different bits and pieces are in source code, since each of the different bits and pieces has a different coloring to identify its purpose. It helps you to distinguish the building blocks of code more easily, and if you use similar development software to write your CSS and HTML documents, you'll also find that you make fewer mistakes and typos, since syntax coloring also helps you to write code that is more bug free.</p><p>Many of the source code examples feature annotations to highlight important, not-to-be-forgotten bits of information, and to visually point out concepts that are discussed in the surrounding text.</p><p>This edition also features every screenshot from a browser in color, a first for Wrox. Presenting the browser screenshots in color makes it easier for you to compare your results with what you see in the book.</p><p>This book also approaches CSS development from a browser-neutral point of view, and provides all the information that you need to get a good healthy start on professional cross-browser, cross-platform website design with IE 6, IE 7, Firefox 2, Opera 9, and Safari 2, which will allow you to reach over 99 percent of the web browsing public.</p><p>You also see comprehensive coverage of bugs, and workarounds for the IE 6 and IE 7 web browsers. Long a thorn in the side of CSS developers, making CSS work in IE 6 can be quite a chore without detailed knowledge of its quirks and shortcomings. This book covers many of the hacks and nonstandard workarounds that you may need to develop compatible CSS content in IE 6. IE 7 features many great improvements to CSS support, and though they are much fewer than its predecessor, you still need a few tricks to make your web page shine in Microsoft's latest browser. It covers the workarounds that you'll need to make your pages work just as well in IE 7 as they do in all the other popular browsers. In addition, you'll find the quick reference in Appendix B updated to reflect all of IE 7's new CSS support.</p><p>Along with better coverage of Internet Explorer, there's greatly improved coverage of Mac OS X browsers, Safari, Firefox, and Opera. You'll see that Mac browsers are equally represented among their Windows brethren.</p><p><b>Whom Is This Book For?</b> This book's primary audience is anyone seeking to learn how to use cascading style sheets to present web documents. Because cascading style sheets are used to control the presentational layout of a web document, people from backgrounds in art, graphic design, or those who prepare print layouts for publishing will feel at home using CSS. Regardless of your background, CSS is a simple and powerful language designed so that anyone can understand and use it.</p><p>To get the most out of this book, you need some experience with markup languages like HTML or XHTML. If you are completely new to website design and development, you should begin learning web programming with Jon Duckett's <em>Beginning Web Programming with HTML, XHTML, and CSS</em>. Jon Duckett's book provides a complete overview of website development and design for the complete beginner, whereas <em>Beginning CSS: Cascading Style Sheets for Web Design, Second Edition</em> focuses specifically on the role of CSS in website design.</p><p>This book presents all of the material you need to become comfortable with writing CSS from scratch.</p><p><b>What Does This Book Cover?</b> This book covers portions of the CSS Level 1, 2, 2.1, and 3 specifications. These specifications are created by an independent, not-for-profit Internet standards organization called the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that plans and defines how Internet documents work. The majority of the book is written using what is defined in the CSS Level 2.1 specification.</p><p>This book leads you through how to write CSS so that it is compatible with all of the most popular web browsers, focused on all of the following popular browsers:</p><ul><li><p>Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 for Windows</p></li><li><p>Windows Internet Explorer 7 for Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows Server 2003, Windows XP Professional 64 bit, and Windows Vista</p></li><li><p>Safari 2 for Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger)</p></li><li><p>Mozilla Firefox 2 for Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux</p></li><li><p>Opera 9 for Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux</p></li></ul><p>The preceding browsers make up over 99 percent of the web browser market share at the time of this writing. For your convenience, this book also includes an integrated CSS feature reference throughout the book, as well as notes on browser compatibility. A CSS reference is also included in Appendix B.</p><p><b>How This Book Is Structured:</b> This book is divided into three parts. The following explains each of these three parts in detail, and what each chapter covers.</p><p><b>Part I: The Basics:</b> Throughout Chapters 1 through 4 you learn the founding principles of CSS-based web design.</p><ul><li><p><b>Chapter 1, \"Introducing Cascading Style Sheets\":</b> This chapter talks about what CSS is, why it exists, who created it, where it is maintained, and how it has evolved. It also discusses some of the basic differences among the various CSS specifications—CSS Level 1, CSS Level 2, CSS Level 2.1, and CSS Level 3—and how these specifications define what CSS is. You also learn more about each of the most popular browsers in use today, how to obtain them, and write your first CSS-enabled document. It also shows you how to install Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 7 side-by-side on the same computer for testing.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 2, \"The Essentials\":</b> This chapter introduces the basics of CSS. Now that you have seen an example CSS document, this chapter introduces CSS rules and how selectors and declarations are combined to create rules. It demonstrates the various methods used to include CSS in a document. It explains how keywords are used in CSS to create predefined behavior, and how strings are used in CSS to refer to font names in a style sheet. It presents the various units of measurement that CSS supports. Finally, it talks about the different ways of specifying color.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 3, \"Selectors\":</b> Chapter 2 introduced the concept of selectors. Chapter 3 talks about complex selectors, and how you apply style to a portion of a document based on its context within the document or user-initiated events.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 4, \"The Cascade and Inheritance\":</b> In Chapter 4, you learn about how to override styles, how precedence works in a style sheet, and how some styles can be considered more important than others, concepts that come together to define the cascade in cascading style sheets. You also learn how once you set some styles in a document, those styles can be inherited to other parts of a document depending on the context in which they are applied.</p></li></ul><p><b>Part II: Properties:</b> Throughout Chapters 5 through 12, you learn about properties that are used to manipulate the presentation of a document.</p><ul><li><p><b>Chapter 5, \"Text Manipulation\":</b> Chapter 5, presents the various properties that CSS provides for text manipulation. These properties provide effects such as controlling the amount of space between the letters of words, controlling the amount of space between the words of a paragraph, controlling text alignment, underlining, overlining, or strike-through text. It also shows how to control the case of text by making text all lowercase, uppercase, or capitalized.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 6, \"Fonts\":</b> After you have seen the properties that CSS provides for text manipulation in Chapter 5, Chapter 6 presents the CSS properties you can use to manipulate the presentation of fonts. These effects include applying bold text, setting a font face, setting the font size, setting an italic font, as well as learning to use a property that enables you to specify all CSS's font effects in one single property.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 7, \"The Box Model\":</b> Chapter 7 elaborates on a design concept fundamental to CSS design: The Box Model. You learn how the box model plays an important role in determining layout dimensions. Using the margin, border, padding, width, and height properties, you can control how much space elements within a document occupy, how much space separates them, whether there are borders around them, whether scroll bars should be included. It also discusses a CSS phenomenon known as margin collapsing, which is what happens when top or bottom margins come into direct contact with other top or bottom margins in a web document.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 8, \"CSS Buoyancy:</b> Floating and Vertical Alignment\": Chapter 8, discusses <code>float</code> and <code>clear</code>, two properties used to control the flow of layout in a web document and often used to flow text beside images. It also discusses the <code>vertical-align</code> property, which is used to create effects like subscript or superscript text, as well as to control vertical alignment in table cells.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 9, \"List Properties\":</b> In this chapter, you'll look at the properties CSS provides to control presentation of ordered and unordered lists. This discussion includes the options CSS provides for predefined list markers, custom list markers, and the position of list markers.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 10, \"Backgrounds\":</b> Chapter 10, presents the properties CSS provides to control backgrounds in a web page. This includes properties that set a background color or background image, as well as those that control the position of a background, the tiling of a background, and whether a background remains fixed in place as a web page is scrolled or remains static. Finally, the chapter shows you how to use a property that combines all these individual effects into a single property.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 11, \"Positioning\":</b> You'll see four different types of positioning: static, relative, absolute, and fixed. You use positioning primarily to layer portions of a document. It also describes some of the practical uses for positioning, such as creating a multicolumn layout.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 12, \"Tables\":</b> Chapter 12, presents the different properties that CSS provides for styling (X)HTML tables. The properties presented in this chapter let you control the spacing between the cells of a table, the placement of the table caption, and whether empty cells are rendered. It also looks in detail at the available tags and options that (X)HTML provides for structuring tabular data.</p></li></ul><p><b>Part III: Advanced CSS and Alternative Media:</b> Throughout Chapters 13, 14, and 15 you learn about how to use CSS to make documents for printing, and another kind of document altogether, XML.</p><ul><li><p><b>Chapter 13, \"Styling for Print\":</b> This chapter discusses what steps to take to use CSS to provide alternative style sheets to create a printer-friendly version of a web document.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 14, \"XML\":</b> In this chapter, you see how you can use CSS to style XML content. This chapter focuses specifically on the CSS display property and how you use this property to change the behavior of tags in an XML or HTML/XHTML document.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 15, \"The Cursor Property\":</b> Here you see how you can change the user's mouse cursor using CSS, how you can customize the mouse cursor, and what browsers support which cursor features.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 16, \"Dean Edwards's 'IE7'\":</b> This chapter talks about one alternative to many of the hacks and workarounds that you need for IE6. It talks about how to install an HTTP server for your website, and how to install and use Dean Edwards's \"IE7\" JavaScript, which is a collection of IE6 hacks and workarounds designed to make \"IE6\" feature compatible with its successor. This chapter is available online only, on the Wrox website at <code>www.wrox.com/go/beginning_css2e</code>.</p></li><li><p><b>Appendixes:</b> Appendix A contains the answers to chapter exercises. Appendix B, \"CSS Reference,\" provides a place for you to look up CSS features and browser compatibility on the fly. Appendix C, \"CSS Colors,\" provides a reference of CSS named colors. Appendix D, \"Browser Rendering Modes,\" provides a reference for the browser rendering modes invoked by the presence or absence of a Document Type Declaration (discussed in Chapter 7).</p></li></ul></span></span>",

Each chapter\nstarts out with an example of an unbulletproof site one that\nemploys a traditional HTML-based approach which Dan then\ndeconstructs, pointing out its limitations. He then gives the site\na make-over using XHTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), so you\ncan see how to replace bloated code with lean markup and CSS for\nfast-loading sites that are accessible to all users. Finally, he\ncovers several popular fluid and elastic-width layout techniques\nand pieces together all of the page components discussed in prior\nchapters into a single-page template.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>\nCascading Style Sheets (CSS) are a powerful way to enrich the\npresentation of HTML-based web pages, allowing web authors to give\ntheir pages a more sophisticated look and more structure. CSS's\ncompact file size helps web pages load quickly, and by allowing\nchanges made in one place to be applied across the entire document,\nCSS can save hours of tedious changing and updating. But to\nleverage the full power of CSS, web authors first have to sift\nthrough CSS theory to find practical solutions that resolve\nreal-world problems. Web authors can waste hours and earn ulcers\ntrying to find answers to those all-too-common dilemmas that crop\nup with each project. The <em>CSS Cookbook</em> cuts straight through\nthe theory to provide hundreds of useful examples and CSS code\nrecipes that web authors can use immediately to format their web\npages. The time saved by a single one of these recipes will make\nits cover price money well-spent. But the <em>CSS Cookbook</em>\nprovides more than quick code solutions to pressing problems. The\nexplanation that accompanies each recipe enables readers to\ncustomize the formatting for their specific purposes, and shows why\nthe solution works, so you can adapt these techniques to other\nsituations. Recipes range from the basics that every web author\nneeds to code concoctions that will take your web pages to new\nlevels. Reflecting CSS2, the latest specification, and including\ntopics that range from basic web typography and page layout to\ntechniques for formatting lists, forms, and tables, it is easy to\nsee why the <em>CSS Cookbook</em> is regarded as an excellent\ncompanion to <em>Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide</em>\nand a must-have resource for any web author who has even considered\nusing CSS.\n</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>\nSimply put, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a way to separate a\ndocument's structure from its presentation. The benefits of this\ncan be quite profound: CSS allows a much richer document appearance\nthan HTML; CSS saves time--you can create or change the appearance\nof an entire document in just one place; and its compact file size\nmakes web pages load quickly. Eric Meyer, a member of the\nCSS&amp;FP Working Group and an internationally known expert on\nHTML and CSS, tackles the subject with passion and delivers a\ncomprehensive and thorough update to his groundbreaking book. All\nreaders will benefit from both the depth and breadth of his\nexperience and his clear and honest style. <em>Cascading Style\nSheets: The Definitive Guide</em>, 2nd Edition is a thorough review\nof all aspects of CSS2.1 and a comprehensive guide to CSS\nimplementation. The book includes new content on positioning, lists\nand generated content, table layout, user interface, paged media,\nand more. It explores in detail each individual CSS property and\nhow it interacts with other properties, and shows how to avoid\ncommon mistakes in interpretation. If you're ready to take the next\nstep with your HTML coding and incorporate CSS or are already a CSS\ncode warrior, you'll find <em>Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive\nGuide</em>, 2nd Edition is the book you've been craving.\n</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Create 2D Animation with CSS animations (CSS3 methods), interactive examples &amp; projects - hands-on beginner training</p><p><b>About This Video</b></p><ul><li>We like to be thorough in our teaching. You'll find everything you need to start creating awesome 2D animations in this course. You won't have to look anywhere else.</li><li>We strongly advocate learning by doing, rather than just listening or reading.</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>When you hear the term 2D Animation, especially web animations, you probably imagine complicated Javascript codes, Flash or other hard-to-learn proprietary software programs. That's how it was until a few years ago. You had to spend days, or months mastering complicated software or learning a lot of syntaxes until you could create decent web animations. But no more! CSS3, and along with it, CSS Animations were released a few years ago, and they've have made your learning process MUCH easier. If you know the very basics of HTML and CSS, which anyone who has anything to do with coding/web design does, you're all set. Spend a few hours learning a bunch of CSS3 Animation syntaxes, and you'll be creating awesome web effects and keyframe animations in no time at all! Anyone can become a web animator now. Our course has 3 modules, where each module will thoroughly explain the intricacies of one of the concepts in CSS Animations with a wealth of over-the-shoulder examples. </p><p>Here are the modules:</p><p>Module 1 - Transformations - This is the foundation's module. You'll learn how to manipulate your web elements in this module. You'll learn how to move the elements around the web page, rotate them to any angle you want, resize them, skew them and so much more.</p><p>Module 2 - Transition animations - You'll learn how to smoothly transition an element from one state to another in here, so it looks like an animation. Change it's colors, size, position, stylings and so much more based on the conditions you give. You'll also learn to customize the transition animations by delaying them, changing the speed of the animation, changing the duration of the animation and so much more.</p><p>Module 3 - Keyframe animations - A bigger and more important concept. In here, you'll learn how to create frames that depict every single animation you want to be applied to your web elements. In the duration of the animation, you'll be able to perform multiple changes to your element. Learn how to give the illusion of movement to create high class animated scenes. Learn how to create real-world 2D animation effects by using the various properties and features available in keyframe animations.

With mobile internet usage still rising, and tablets changing internet consumption habits, you need to know how to build websites that will just 'work', regardless of the devices used to access them. This second edition of Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS3 explains all the key approaches necessary to create and maintain a modern responsive design.</p><p>The changing way in which we access the web means that there has never been a greater range of screen sizes and associated user experiences to consider. With these recent trends driving changes in design, typical desktop-only websites fail to meet even minimum expectations when it comes to style and usability, which can be vital when your website is central to yours or your client's brand.

    "description": "<span><span><p><em>Foundation Website Creation with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript</em> shows the entire process of building a website. This process involves much more than just technical knowledge, and this book provides all the information you'll need to understand the concepts behind designing and developing for the Web, as well as the best means to deliver professional results based on best practices.</p><p>Of course, there is far more to building a successful website than knowing a little Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). The process starts long before any coding takes place, and this book introduces you to the agile development process, explaining why this method makes so much sense for web projects and how best to implement it. We also make sure you're up to date by using the latest HTML5 features. Planning is vital, so you'll also learn to use techniques such as brainstorming, wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to get your project off to the best possible start and help ensure smooth progress as it develops.</p><p>An understanding of correct, semantic markup is essential for any web professional; this book explains how HTML5 should be used to structure content so that the markup adheres to current web standards. You'll learn about the wide range of HTML5 elements available to you, and you'll learn how and when to use them through building example web pages.</p><p>Without creative use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), websites would all look largely the same. CSS enables you to set your website apart from the rest, while maintaining the integrity of your markup. We'll showcase the new features of CSS3 and how you can use them. You'll learn how CSS3 works and how to apply styles to your pages, allowing you to realize your design ideas in the browser.</p><p>JavaScript can be used to make your website easier and more interesting to use. This book provides information on appropriate uses of this technology and introduces the concepts of JavaScript programming. You'll also see how JavaScript works as part of the much-hyped technique Ajax, and in turn, where Ajax fits into the wider Web 2.0 picture.</p><p>While a website is being built, it needs to be tested across multiple browsers and platforms to ensure that the site works for all users, regardless of ability or disability, and this book explains how best to accomplish these tasks. Then, it discusses the process of launching and maintaining the site so that it will continue to work for all its users throughout its life cycle.</p><p><em>Foundation Website Creation with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript</em> concludes by covering server-side technologies, acting as a guide to the different options available. With insights from renowned experts such as <b>Jason Fried</b> of 37signals, <b>Daniel Burka</b> of Digg and Pownce, and <b>Chris Messina</b> of Citizen Agency, <em>Foundation Website Creation with CSS, XHTML, and JavaScript</em> provides invaluable information applicable to every web project—regardless of size, scope, or budget.</p><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><li><p>See how the Web has developed and the role of web standards</p></li><li><p>Learn how to plan and manage the building of a website</p></li><li><p>Learn how to separate content from presentation with HTML5 and CSS3</p></li><li><p>See how JavaScript can be used to enhance your website</p></li><li><p>Learn how best to test, launch, and maintain a website</p></li><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p>Web developers and designers starting out in HTML5 and CSS3.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>It’s widely predicted that mobile phones and tablets will\novertake desktop PCs as the most common Web access devices within\nthe next two or three years. Adobe is responding to this dramatic\nshift by focusing on new tools to develop websites for multiple\nplatforms with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in Dreamweaver CS5.5. In\nparticular, Dreamweaver engineers have been working closely with\nthe developers of jQuery, the de-facto standard JavaScript\nframework, to develop jQuery Mobile. This is a new JavaScript/CSS\nframework designed to create websites and applications that work\nconsistently in all major mobile platforms, including iPhone,\nAndroid, BlackBerry, and Symbian (Nokia). This book explores in\ndepth the integration of jQuery Mobile in Dreamweaver, together\nwith other new features aimed at building websites that work across\nmultiple devices.<br/>\n <br/>\nUsing a series of practical examples, the book will show how to\noptimize an existing website for display in desktops, tablets, and\nmobile phones, using CSS media queries. Readers will also learn how\nto create a dedicated mobile site using jQuery Mobile. Although\nDreamweaver will generate much of the necessary code automatically,\nthe book will explain the structure of jQuery Mobile websites and\nweb applications, so that developers can go beyond the basics to\nadd custom functionality and design features. The book will also\nutilize the core jQuery framework, demonstrating how the new jQuery\ncode hinting in Dreamweaver CS5.5 speeds up the development process\nfor experienced developers and acts as a learning aid for those new\nto jQuery. Readers will learn how to convert a jQuery Mobile web\napplication into a native app (that can be loaded on an iPhone or\nAndroid device) using PhoneGap, another open source\nframework.<br/></p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>This book is for anyone who wants to learn about using .NET for web interface design. Beginner or hobbyist .NET developers can certainly get a good foundation of .NET web interface design by going through this book from cover to cover. However, more seasoned .NET professionals, especially if they tend to steer away from the GUI of their projects, can also pick up a thing or two by focusing on certain chapters that appeal to them. This book is meant to take a reader from the beginning of a project to the completion of the interface design. Along the way, concepts are illustrated to show how the different pieces play together. So, anyone who really wants to understand the concepts presented in this book will be able to do so by reading the entire thing. However, this book should also serve as a good reference after you have read it or, in some cases, in place of reading it.</p><p>All of the early chapters provide useful information and examples for any web developer. Many of the concepts presented after Chapter 4 are more specifically targeted at .NET developers. In the later chapters, the target audience is .NET developers or, at least, people who want to become .NET developers. In those chapters, you should probably have at least a basic understanding of the .NET Framework and some experience with Visual Studio 2005 (or possibly Visual Studio 2003). If you are completely new to .NET, you may find it useful to pick up a beginning ASP.NET 2.0 book before delving too deeply into those chapters. If you want to learn about .NET 2.0 web interface design, you are the intended audience.</p><p>It should be noted that all of the .NET code samples in this book are in C#. However, this shouldn't limit other developers, such as VB.NET developers, from understanding the concepts or being able to replicate the code in their own projects. The actual managed code examples are pretty limited and, when they are used, they should be fairly easy to port over to VB.NET.</p><p>This book covers the concepts serious developers need to begin designing cool and consistent web layouts. The early chapters focus on general web design standards that you need to grasp in order to move into the later chapters. Specifically, these concepts are:</p><ul><li><p>Basic web design considerations (colors, fonts, images, accessibility, and so on) (Chapter 2)</p></li><li><p>Photoshop basics to get you started making your own graphics and color schemes (Chapter 3)</p></li><li><p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and their use in web design layout (Chapter 4)</p></li></ul><p>When you finish these chapters, you will have the basic shell for the project that you will continue to develop throughout the book. You will have the header graphic, color scheme, and CSS layout that you will begin to incorporate .NET-specific concepts to in the later chapters. This includes:</p><ul><li><p>How to make .NET controls render accessible CSS code rather than their default: tables (Chapter 5)</p></li><li><p>Using the built-in controls of .NET to create easily maintainable and consistent site navigation (and how to make them render CSS divs instead of tables) (Chapter 6)</p></li><li><p>Creating your web site template with Master Pages (Chapter 7)</p></li><li><p>Creating themes and skins to style your .NET controls (Chapter 8)</p></li><li><p>Applying themes to your projects through various approaches, including base classing (Chapter 9)</p></li></ul><p>The final \"regular\" chapter ends with you building an entirely new mobile device theme using all of the concepts learned in the previous chapters. In Chapter 10, you will start with modifying your graphic to better fit the resolution of your mobile devices. You will also learn how to modify your stylesheets and apply them programmatically to be used only for this theme. You will have a new Master Page and an entirely new theme. You will also see one way of switching themes based on your criteria (in this example, your criterion will be whether your client browser is a mobile device).</p><p>Beyond these chapters, you will get a \"forward look\" at some of the new technologies coming down the pipeline that affect these some of the material you learned in the preceding chapters. In Appendix A, you will get a glimpse at the upcoming release for Visual Studio, codenamed \"Orcas.\" This will almost exclusively focus on the new CSS features because they are the most relevant to the other chapters of the book, and there are so many new features regarding CSS management in this release that they warrant their own chapter (nested Master Pages are also included, but CSS takes up most of the appendix).</p><p>Finally, with Appendix B, the Visual Studio Codename \"Orcas\" discussion is extended to include Microsoft Silverlight. You will learn how to create drawing object, incorporate images, animate your objects, and affect the rendered output through your managed code.</p><p>If you read this book from cover to cover, you should end up with a really solid understanding of the current technologies for .NET developers to create consistent and accessible web interfaces, as well as a feeling of excitement for the new stuff that should be coming soon to a computer near you.</p></span></span>",
