    "description": "<span><span><span><p><strong>Over 9Hours of Video Instruction</strong></p><p><strong>Description</strong></p><p>Learn all about Linux internals and how Linux really works.</p><p><em>Linux Under the Hood</em>is a unique video project that focuses on Linux internals, so you can get the most out of the Linux operating system. Although most Linux books and videos explain how to accomplish tasks in Linux, this video course goes beyond the how and dives into the why. So, instead of learning how to use commands and configure services, you will take a look at what's happening in Linux when you perform tasks. We'll go deeply into the Linux operating system in a way that is understandable to anyone who has already worked a bit with Linux. There's no need to be an expert or have a C programming language background; the only thing that is required is a bit of experience with the Linux operating system and a desire to learn really understand it.</p><p>This course offers 13 lessons that cover everything the audience needs to know to understand how Linux functions. The approach of this video course emphasizes real concept teaching. A minimal amount of slides will be used, with most videos diving into Linux internals and concepts using white board explanations and command line screencasts.</p><p>The video lessons cover the following topics:</p><p>Lesson 1: How Linux is organized</p><p>Lesson 2: About C code, scripts and compiled programs</p><p>Lesson 3: Understanding Linux commands and how they work</p><p>Lesson 4: Understanding the Linux boot procedure</p><p>Lesson 5: Understanding Linux storage</p><p>Lesson 6: Understanding memory management</p><p>Lesson 7: Understanding processes</p><p>Lesson 8: Security</p><p>Lesson 9: Hardware initialization</p><p>Lesson 10: Looking closer at the kernel</p><p>Lesson 11: Understanding networking</p><p>Lesson 12: Performance optimization</p><p>Lesson 13: The future of Linux</p><p><strong>About the Instructor</strong></p><p><strong>Sander van Vugt</strong>is an independent Linux trainer, author, and consultant living in the Netherlands. Sander has written numerous books about different Linux-related topics and many articles for Linux publications around the world. Sander has been teaching Red Hat, Ubuntu, SUSE, and LPI Linux classes since 1994. As a consultant, he specializes in Linux High Availability solutions and Performance Optimization.

    "description": "<span><div><p><i>The Linux Programming Interface</i> is the definitive guide to the Linux and UNIX programming interface—the interface employed by nearly every application that runs on a Linux or UNIX system.</p><p>In this authoritative work, Linux programming expert Michael Kerrisk provides detailed descriptions of the system calls and library functions that you need in order to master the craft of system programming, and accompanies his explanations with clear, complete example programs.</p><p>You'll find descriptions of over 500 system calls and library functions, and more than 200 example programs, 88 tables, and 115 diagrams. You'll learn how to:</p><ul><li>Read and write files efficiently</li><li>Use signals, clocks, and timers</li><li>Create processes and execute programs</li><li>Write secure programs</li><li>Write multithreaded programs using POSIX threads</li><li>Build and use shared libraries</li><li>Perform interprocess communication using pipes, message queues, shared memory, and semaphores</li><li>Write network applications with the sockets API</li></ul><p>While <i>The Linux Programming Interface</i> covers a wealth of Linux-specific features, including <i>epoll</i>, <i>inotify</i>, and the <i>/proc</i> file system, its emphasis on UNIX standards (POSIX.1-2001/SUSv3 and POSIX.1-2008/SUSv4) makes it equally valuable to programmers working on other UNIX platforms.</p><p><i>The Linux Programming Interface</i> is the most comprehensive single-volume work on the Linux and UNIX programming interface, and a book that's destined to become a new classic.</p><br/><br/><b>Praise for <i>The Linux Programming Interface</i></b><br/><br/>\"If I had to choose a single book to sit next to my machine when writing software for Linux, this would be it.\"Martin Landers, Software Engineer, Google<br/><br/>\"This book, with its detailed descriptions and examples, contains everything you need to understand the details and nuances of the low-level programming APIs in Linux . . . no matter what the level of reader, there will be something to be learnt from this book.\"Mel Gorman, Author of <i>Understanding the Linux Virtual Memory Manager</i><br/><br/>\"Michael Kerrisk has not only written a great book about Linux programming and how it relates to various standards, but has also taken care that bugs he noticed got fixed and the man pages were (greatly) improved. In all three ways, he has made Linux programming easier. The in-depth treatment of topics in <i>The Linux Programming Interface</i> . . . makes it a must-have reference for both new and experienced Linux programmers.\"Andreas Jaeger, Program Manager, openSUSE, Novell<br/><br/>\"Michael's inexhaustible determination to get his information right, and to express it clearly and concisely, has resulted in a strong reference source for programmers. While this work is targeted at Linux programmers, it will be of value to any programmer working in the UNIX/POSIX ecosystem.\"David Butenhof, Author of <i>Programming with POSIX Threads</i> and Contributor to the POSIX and UNIX Standards<br/><br/>\". . . a very thorough—yet easy to read—explanation of UNIX system and network programming, with an emphasis on Linux systems. It's certainly a book I'd recommend to anybody wanting to get into UNIX programming (in general) or to experienced UNIX programmers wanting to know 'what's new' in the popular GNU/Linux system.\"Fernando Gont, Network Security Researcher, IETF Participant, and RFC Author<br/><br/>\". . . encyclopedic in the breadth and depth of its coverage, and textbook-like in its wealth of worked examples and exercises. Each topic is clearly and comprehensively covered, from theory to hands-on working code. Professionals, students, educators, this is the Linux/UNIX reference that you have been waiting for.\"Anthony Robins, Associate Professor of Computer Science, The University of Otago<br/><br/>\"I've been very impressed by the precision, the quality and the level of detail Michael Kerrisk put in his book. He is a great expert of Linux system calls and lets us share his knowledge and understanding of the Linux APIs.\"Christophe Blaess, Author of <i>Programmation systeme en C sous Linux</i><br/><br/>\". . . an essential resource for the serious or professional Linux and UNIX systems programmer. Michael Kerrisk covers the use of all the key APIs across both the Linux and UNIX system interfaces with clear descriptions and tutorial examples and stresses the importance and benefits of following standards such as the Single UNIX Specification and POSIX 1003.1.\"Andrew Josey, Director, Standards, The Open Group, and Chair of the POSIX 1003.1 Working Group<br/><br/>\"What could be better than an encyclopedic reference to the Linux system, from the standpoint of the system programmer, written by none other than the maintainer of the man pages himself? <i>The Linux Programming Interface</i> is comprehensive and detailed. I firmly expect it to become an indispensable addition to my programming bookshelf.\"Bill Gallmeister, Author of <i>POSIX.4 Programmer's Guide: Programming for the Real World</i><br/><br/>\". . . the most complete and up-to-date book about Linux and UNIX system programming. If you're new to Linux system programming, if you're a UNIX veteran focused on portability while interested in learning the Linux way, or if you're simply looking for an excellent reference about the Linux programming interface, then Michael Kerrisk's book is definitely the companion you want on your bookshelf.\"Loic Domaigne, Chief Software Architect (Embedded), Corpuls.com<br/></div></span>",

It starts by installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux, after which basic utilities are covered. Then, it will dig into the different ways to log in to a Linux server, and to run administrator tasks. In the last three lessons of this module, how to work with users and permissions and how to configure networking is discussed.</p><p>Module 2, “Operating Red Hat Enterprise Linux Servers,” will teach the common tasks that are involved in day-to-day administration of RHEL servers. This includes installing software, managing processes, configuring logging, working with virtual machines, and managing storage, which is about partitions and logical volumes.</p><p>Module 3, “Performing Advanced System Administration Tasks,” goes over the tasks that won't be performed on a daily basis. Managing the Linux kernel and the boot procedure will be discussed, and in the last part of this module, there will be a walk-through of some common troubleshooting scenarios.</p><p>Module 4, “Managing Network Services,” shows how to configure those services where networking is involved. It starts by looking at the SSH server, followed by the Apache web. Next, SELinux, a vital part of RHEL that helps make it a secure platform, will be explained. Firewalling, network based automatic installation, and time are also covered.</p><p>Module 5 provides an RHCSA Sample exam.</p><p><strong>About Pearson Video Training</strong></p><p>Pearson publishes expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

    "description": "<span><p><strong>5</strong><strong>+ Hours of Video Instruction</strong><br/><strong> </strong><br/><strong>Overview</strong></p><p>The Linux Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful tool for users, developers, and administrators. Quick changes to a system with no Graphical Interface such as many servers or some recovery tasks, can be accomplished with command line tools. Repetitive tasks such as file management and local access control changes can be dome more efficiently from the command line than through a point and click interface. Learning to use the Linux CLI also prepares for full automation with scripting tools.</p><p><em>Linux Command Line Complete Video Course</em> introduces common utilities used at the Linux command line. While learning commands for specific tasks, you will obtain greater confidence navigating the Linux filesystem, understand how to locate and edit files, use Bash shell features for efficiency and automation, and be able to use built-in help for further exploration.</p><p><strong>About the Instructor</strong></p><p>Susan Lauber has over 20 years experience in Information Systems from data analyst to network operating systems support to curriculum design. She currently focuses on training and consulting in just about anything OpenSource and holds all positions in her own company, Lauber System Solutions, Inc. Susan has a Masters in Information Science from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and is a Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) and a Certified Technical Trainer (CTT).

    "title": "Understanding the Linux Kernel, 3rd Edition",
    "description": "<span><p/><div><p>In order to thoroughly understand what makes Linux tick and why it works so well on a wide variety of systems, you need to delve deep into the heart of the kernel. The kernel handles all interactions between the CPU and the external world, and determines which programs will share processor time, in what order. It manages limited memory so well that hundreds of processes can share the system efficiently, and expertly organizes data transfers so that the CPU isn't kept waiting any longer than necessary for the relatively slow disks.</p><p>The third edition of <i>Understanding the Linux Kernel</i> takes you on a guided tour of the most significant data structures, algorithms, and programming tricks used in the kernel. Probing beyond superficial features, the authors offer valuable insights to people who want to know how things really work inside their machine.  Important Intel-specific features are discussed. Relevant segments of code are dissected line by line. But the book covers more than just the functioning of the code; it explains the theoretical underpinnings of why Linux does things the way it does.</p><p>This edition of the book covers Version 2.6, which has seen significant changes to nearly every kernel subsystem, particularly in the areas of memory management and block devices. The book focuses on the following topics:</p><ul><li>Memory management, including file buffering, process swapping, and Direct memory Access (DMA) </li><li>The Virtual Filesystem layer and the Second and Third Extended Filesystems</li><li>Process creation and scheduling</li><li>Signals, interrupts, and the essential interfaces to device drivers</li><li>Timing</li><li>Synchronization within the kernel</li><li>Interprocess Communication (IPC) </li><li>Program execution</li></ul><p><i>Understanding the Linux Kernel</i> will acquaint you with all the inner workings of Linux, but it's more than just an academic exercise. You'll learn what conditions bring out Linux's best performance, and you'll see how it meets the challenge of providing good system response during process scheduling, file access, and memory management in a wide variety of environments. This book will help you make the most of your Linux system.</p></div></span>",

OpenShift is an increasingly popular platform that helps you more easily deploy applications in an enterprise environment. The platform helps developers to seamlessly roll out an application in the form of a completely operational container. At the same time, it allows administrators to manage the application life cycle in a flexible way, where applications can be monitored for availability, and easily scaled up and down if the workload requires it.</p><p>Learn how to get started with OpenShift in six lessons. In the first lesson, you'll learn how OpenShift can help you. An explanation of what OpenShift is, and how it relates to the Kubernetes platform is provided. The second lesson discusses how to get started with OpenShift, and different installation scenarios are demonstrated. Lesson 3 shows how to deploy applications in OpenShift, and Lesson 4 will explain software-defined networking, as implemented in OpenShift. Lesson 5 discusses more advanced features, such as pod scaling and node placement; and Lesson 6 shows how to connect containers in OpenShift to storage. With a combination of white-board instruction, demonstrations, and CLI learning, Sander van Vugt demystifies OpenShift.</p><p><strong>Skill Level</strong></p><ul><li>\n    Beginner/Intermediate\n  </li></ul><p><strong>Learn How To</strong></p><ul><li>\n    Understand when and how to use OpenShift depending on your environment\n  </li><li>\n    Install the various versions of OpenShift\n  </li><li>\n    Create applications from the web console\n  </li><li>\n    Creating resources using the oc command line utility\n  </li><li>\n    Use source-to-image to automatically build containers from the source code\n  </li><li>\n    Use software-defined networking and using SDN in OpenShift\n  </li><li>\n    Work with applications, including scaling\n  </li><li>\n    Handle pod scheduling\n  </li><li>\n    Manage images, image streams, and OpenShift templates\n  </li><li>\n    Set up OpenShift storage\n  </li></ul><p><strong>Who Should Take This Course</strong></p><p>\n  IT professionals that want to manage container deployment in their containerized DevOps environment using OpenShift. Target audience roles:</p><ul><li>\n    IT Administrators\n  </li><li>\n    DevOps Engineers\n  </li><li>\n    Software Developers\n  </li><li>\n    IT Architects\n  </li><li>\n    Hybrid Cloud Administrators\n  </li></ul><p><strong>Course Requirements</strong></p><p>\n  4 GiB of RAM, 20 GiB of available disk space and a virtualization program like Oracle VirtualBox or VMware Workstation</p><p><strong>Lesson Descriptions</strong></p><p>\n  Lesson 1, “Understanding OpenShift,” explains what OpenShift is. A generic introduction in working with containers is provided before an explanation of how OpenShift makes sense in a containerized environment is discussed; OpenShift is a useful addition in a DevOps environment. An example of a typical OpenShift architecture is provided, as well as a comparison to Kubernetes so you know which features are similar, and which are different. Lastly, the role of OpenShift in a hybrid cloud environment is explained.</p><p>\n  In Lesson 2, “Installing OpenShift,” an overview of all the different OpenShift versions will be discussed as well as the installation of them. Next, getting started with MiniShift, and how to bring up an OpenShift cluster using the oc client will be shown. After learning about these easy-to-setup solutions, starting to explore what is needed for setting up a real OpenShift cluster is next on the menu. The lesson ends with a discussion of host requirements, as well as a demonstration of an installation of a 3-node OpenShift cluster.</p><p>\n  Lesson 3, “Getting Started with OpenShift,” goes beyond set up and gets into what you can do with OpenShift, starting with how to create an application from the web console, which should provide a decent example of all that is involved in the application build process. In that build process, different resource types are involved, which will be discussed next. After the foundation of managing resources from the browser interface is covered, creating resources using the oc command line utility will be explained. Next up: source-to-image, the procedure that developers will apply to automate building software applications with OpenShift is discussed. The last video in this lesson provides a short introduction to troubleshooting.</p><p>\n  Lesson 4, “Managing OpenShift Networking,” explains how to have the containers in OpenShift communicate with one another, and to expose their functionality to the outside world, there needs to be software defined networking. This lesson starts by explaining what exactly software-defined networking is in general, and after that, SDN in OpenShift. Services and routes will also be covered.</p><p>\n  Lesson 5, “Deploying Applications,” covers how to work with applications. This lesson consists of how to scale applications and exploring pod scheduling. After that, looking at images and image stream‚Äìand how these can be managed‚Äìis explained. The last video teaches about OpenShift templates.</p><p>\n  In Lesson 6, “Managing OpenShift Storage,” how to provide storage to the workloads that are running in your containers is covered. Starting with an overview of OpenShift storage solutions and working up to how to set up OpenShift Storage; the last video will work through a scenario where NFS persistent storage is used in an OpenShift environment.</p><p><strong>About Pearson Video Training</strong></p><p>Pearson publishes expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

    "description": "<span><span><p>\nThis book is for anyone who wants to support computer peripherals\nunder the Linux operating system or who wants to develop new\nhardware and run it under Linux. Linux is the fastest-growing\nsegment of the UNIX market and is winning over enthusiastic\nadherents in many application areas. This book reveals information\nthat heretofore has been passed by word-of-mouth or in cryptic\nsource code comments, showing how to write a driver for a wide\nrange of devices. You don't have to be a kernel hacker to\nunderstand and enjoy this book; all you need is an understanding of\nC and some background in UNIX system calls. Drivers for character\ndevices, block devices, and network interfaces are all described in\nstep-by-step form and are illustrated with full-featured examples\nthat show driver design issues, which can be executed without\nspecial hardware. For those who are curious about how an operating\nsystem does its job, this book provides insights into address\nspaces, asynchronous events, and I/O. Portability is a major\nconcern in the text. The book is centered on version 2.0, but also\ncovers 1.2.13 and experimental versions up to 2.1.43. You are also\ntold how to maximize portability among hardware platforms. Contents\ninclude:\n</p><ul><li><p>Building a driver and loading modules</p></li><li><p>Complete character, block, and network drivers</p></li><li><p>Debugging a driver</p></li><li><p>Timing</p></li><li><p>Memory management and DMA</p></li><li><p>Interrupts</p></li><li><p>Portability issues</p></li><li><p>Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI)</p></li><li><p>A tour of kernel internals</p></li></ul></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>Many people think of Linux as a computer operating system, running on users' desktops and powering servers. But Linux can also be found inside many consumer electronics devices. Whether they're the brains of a cell phone, cable box, or exercise bike, <i>embedded Linux systems</i> blur the distinction between computer and device. <br/><br/>Many makers love microcontroller platforms such as Arduino, but as the complexity increases in their projects, they need more power for applications, such as computer vision. The BeagleBone is an embedded Linux board for makers. It's got built-in networking, many inputs and outputs, and a fast processor to handle demanding tasks. This book introduces you to both the original BeagleBone and the BeagleBone Black and gets you started with projects that take advantage of the board's processing power and its ability to interface with the outside world.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>If you’re getting started along the exciting path of hacking, cybersecurity, and pentesting, <i>Linux Basics for Hackers</i> is an excellent first step. Using Kali Linux, an advanced penetration testing distribution of Linux, you’ll learn the basics of using the Linux operating system and acquire the tools and techniques you’ll need to take control of a Linux environment.</p><p>First, you’ll learn how to install Kali on a virtual machine and get an introduction to basic Linux concepts. Next, you’ll tackle broader Linux topics like manipulating text, controlling file and directory permissions, and managing user environment variables. You’ll then focus in on foundational hacking concepts like security and anonymity and learn scripting skills with bash and Python. Practical tutorials and exercises throughout will reinforce and test your skills as you learn how to:</p><p>•Cover your tracks by changing your network information and manipulating the rsyslog logging utility<br/>•Write a tool to scan for network connections, and connect and listen to wireless networks<br/>•Keep your internet activity stealthy using Tor, proxy servers, VPNs, and encrypted email<br/>•Write a bash script to scan open ports for potential targets<br/>•Use and abuse services like MySQL, Apache web server, and OpenSSH<br/>•Build your own hacking tools, such as a remote video spy camera and a password cracker</p><p>Hacking is complex, and there is no single way in. Why not start at the beginning with <i>Linux Basics for Hackers?</i></p><p><i>Covers Kali Linux and Python 3</i></p></div></span>",

Device drivers play a critical role in how well a Linux system performs. As Linux has turned out to be one of the most popular operating systems used, the interest in developing proprietary device drivers is also increasing steadily.</p><p>This book will initially help you understand the basics of drivers as well as prepare for the long journey through the Linux Kernel. This book then covers drivers development based on various Linux subsystems such as memory management, PWM, RTC, IIO, IRQ management, and so on.

Are you tired of picking up bits and pieces of information that you can’t just seem to put together? Do you learn best by doing? If so, you are going to love this course.</p><p>A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by the Unix shell, a command-line interpreter. One of the biggest complaints from students is that most of the courses they have taken in the past simply provide information without any context and without any idea of how to put that information to use. This course turns that old, frustrating, and outdated way of learning on its head. It is project-based, which means that instead of learning bits and pieces of information, you will write actual shell scripts that you can use in real-world situations. You get the chance to immediately put what you learn to use so that you fully understand and remember it.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will be able to write shell scripts that will allow you to work with Linux effectively.</p><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p>This course is for anyone who wants to master Linux shell scripting, bash scripting, and the bash shell. This can also be taken by any Linux system administrators, developers, or programmers.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p/><div><p>Device drivers literally drive everything you're interested in--disks, monitors, keyboards, modems--everything outside the computer chip and memory. And writing device drivers is one of the few areas of programming for the Linux operating system that calls for unique, Linux-specific knowledge. For years now, programmers have relied on the classic <i>Linux Device Drivers</i> from O'Reilly to master this critical subject. Now in its third edition, this bestselling guide provides all the information you'll need to write drivers for a wide range of devices.Over the years the book has helped countless programmers learn:</p><ul><li>how to support computer peripherals under the Linux operating system</li><li>how to develop and write software for new hardware under Linux</li><li>the basics of Linux operation even if they are not expecting to write a driver</li></ul>The new edition of <i>Linux Device Drivers</i> is better than ever.  The book covers all the significant changes to Version 2.6 of the Linux kernel, which simplifies many activities, and contains subtle new features that can make a driver both more efficient and more flexible.  Readers will find new chapters on important types of drivers not covered previously, such as consoles, USB drivers, and more.Best of all, you don't have to be a kernel hacker to understand and enjoy this book.  All you need is an understanding of the C programming language and some background in Unix system calls.  And for maximum ease-of-use, the book uses full-featured examples that you can compile and run without special hardware.Today Linux holds fast as the most rapidly growing segment of the computer market and continues to win over enthusiastic adherents in many application areas.  With this increasing support, Linux is now absolutely mainstream, and viewed as a solid platform for embedded systems.  If you're writing device drivers, you'll want this book. In fact, you'll wonder how drivers are ever written without it.</div></span></span>",

You will learn about Platform as a Service and the advantages of building one with containers. Docker offers a way to run isolated processes and also allows you to package an application, along with its run time environment, using primitives such as dockerfiles. However, when it comes to running Docker in a production-like environment, with container workloads spanning across more than one node, you need a COE (Container Orchestration Engine). COEs offer clustering and convert your nodes into one super computer, make intelligent decisions as to where to schedule the containers, connect containers running on different nodes by setting up a multi-host network, and offer many other interesting features such as fault tolerance, zero downtime deployments, and more. OpenShift simplifies Kubernetes deployment by abstracting away the complexity and by providing a simple, unified interface. It also gives you a complete Platform as a Service offering by packaging Kubernetes, Container Registry, Container Runtime, and build and pipelines tools including Jenkins; it also creates best practices and integration out of the box. You can just point to your application code, and OpenShift builds and deploys it taking care of high availability, fault tolerance, scalability, self-healing, and reliability.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p>“Probably the most wide ranging and\ncomplete Linux device driver book I’ve read.”</p><p>--Alan Cox, Linux Guru and Key Kernel\nDeveloper</p><p>“Very comprehensive and detailed,\ncovering almost every single Linux device driver type.”</p><p><b>--</b>Theodore Ts’o, First Linux\nKernel Developer in North America and Chief Platform Strategist of\nthe Linux Foundation</p><p><b>The Most Practical Guide to Writing Linux\nDevice Drivers</b></p><p>Linux now offers an exceptionally robust\nenvironment for driver development: with today’s kernels,\nwhat once required years of development time can be accomplished in\ndays. In this practical, example-driven book, one of the\nworld’s most experienced Linux driver developers\nsystematically demonstrates how to develop reliable Linux drivers\nfor virtually any device. <em><b>Essential Linux Device\nDrivers</b></em> is for any programmer with a working knowledge of\noperating systems and C, including programmers who have never\nwritten drivers before. Sreekrishnan Venkateswaran focuses on the\nessentials, bringing together all the concepts and techniques you\nneed, while avoiding topics that only matter in highly specialized\nsituations. Venkateswaran begins by reviewing the Linux 2.6 kernel\ncapabilities that are most relevant to driver developers. He\nintroduces simple device classes; then turns to serial buses such\nas I2C and SPI; external buses such as PCMCIA, PCI, and USB; video,\naudio, block, network, and wireless device drivers; user-space\ndrivers; and drivers for embedded Linux–one of today’s\nfastest growing areas of Linux development. For each, Venkateswaran\nexplains the technology, inspects relevant kernel source files, and\nwalks through developing a complete example.</p><p>• Addresses drivers discussed in no\nother book, including drivers for I2C, video, sound, PCMCIA, and\ndifferent types of flash memory</p><p>• Demystifies essential kernel\nservices and facilities, including kernel threads and helper\ninterfaces</p><p>• Teaches polling, asynchronous\nnotification, and I/O control</p><p>• Introduces the Inter-Integrated\nCircuit Protocol for embedded Linux drivers</p><p>• Covers multimedia device drivers\nusing the Linux-Video subsystem and Linux-Audio framework</p><p>• Shows how Linux implements support\nfor wireless technologies such as Bluetooth, Infrared, WiFi, and\ncellular networking</p><p>• Describes the entire driver\ndevelopment lifecycle, through debugging and maintenance</p><p>• Includes reference appendixes\ncovering Linux assembly, BIOS calls, and Seq files</p></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p/><p><em>Pro Bash Programming</em> teaches you how to effectively utilize the Bash shell in your programming. The Bash shell is a complete programming language, not merely a glue to combine external Linux commands. By taking full advantage of Shell internals, Shell programs can perform as snappily as utilities written in C or other compiled languages. And you will see how, without assuming Unix lore, you can write professional Bash 4.3 programs through standard programming techniques.</p><p>This second edition has updated for Bash 4.3, and many scripts have been rewritten to make them more idiomatically Bash, taking better advantage of features specific to Bash. It is easy to read, understand, and will teach you how to get to grips with Bash programming without drowning you in pages and pages of syntax. </p><p>Using this book you will be able to use the shell efficiently, make scripts run faster using expansion and external commands, and understand how to overcome many common mistakes that cause scripts to fail. This book is perfect for all beginning Linux and Unix system administrators who want to be in full control of their systems, and really get to grips with Bash programming. </p></span></span>",

But to truly master Linux, you need to understand its internals, like how the system boots, how networking works, and what the kernel actually does.</p><p>In this third edition of the bestselling <i>How Linux Works</i>, author Brian Ward peels back the layers of this well-loved operating system to make Linux internals accessible. This edition has been thoroughly updated and expanded with added coverage of Logical Volume Manager (LVM), virtualization, and containers.</p><p>You'll learn:</p><p>•How Linux boots, from boot loaders to init (systemd)<br/>•How the kernel manages devices, device drivers, and processes<br/>•How networking, interfaces, firewalls, and servers work<br/>•How development tools work and relate to shared libraries<br/>•How to write effective shell scripts</p><p>You’ll also explore the kernel and examine key system tasks inside user space, including system calls, input and output, and filesystems. With its combination of background, theory, real-world examples, and patient explanations, <i>How Linux Works</i>, 3rd edition will teach you what you need to know to solve pesky problems and take control of your operating system.</p></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>If you've ever wondered how Linux carries out the complicated tasks assigned to it by the IP protocols -- or if you just want to learn about modern networking through real-life examples -- <i>Understanding Linux Network Internals</i> is for you.</p><p>Like the popular O'Reilly book, <i>Understanding the Linux Kernel</i>, this book clearly explains the underlying concepts and teaches you how to follow the actual C code that implements it. Although some background in the TCP/IP protocols is helpful, you can learn a great deal from this text about the protocols themselves and their uses. And if you already have a base knowledge of C, you can use the book's code walkthroughs to figure out exactly what this sophisticated part of the Linux kernel is doing.</p><p>Part of the difficulty in understanding networks -- and implementing them -- is that the tasks are broken up and performed at many different times by different pieces of code. One of the strengths of this book is to integrate the pieces and reveal the relationships between far-flung functions and data structures.  <i>Understanding Linux Network Internals</i> is both a big-picture discussion and a no-nonsense guide to the details of Linux networking.  Topics include:</p><ul><li>Key problems with networking</li><li>Network interface card (NIC) device drivers</li><li>System initialization</li><li>Layer 2 (link-layer) tasks and implementation</li><li>Layer 3 (IPv4) tasks and implementation</li><li>Neighbor infrastructure and protocols (ARP)</li><li>Bridging</li><li>Routing</li><li>ICMP</li></ul><p>Author Christian Benvenuti, an operating system designer specializing in networking, explains much more than how Linux code works.  He shows the purposes of major networking features and the trade-offs involved in choosing one solution over another.  A large number of flowcharts and other diagrams enhance the book's understandability.</p></div></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Firewalls, Network Address Translation (NAT), network logging and accounting are all provided by Linux's Netfilter system, also known by the name of the command used to administer it, <em>iptables</em>. The <em>iptables</em> interface is the most sophisticated ever offered onLinux and makes Linux an extremely flexible system for any kind of network filtering you might do. Large sets of filtering rules can be grouped in ways that makes it easy to test them and turn them on and off.Do you watch for all types of ICMP traffic--some of them quite dangerous? Can you take advantage of stateful filtering to simplify the management of TCP connections? Would you like to track how much traffic of various types you get?This pocket reference will help you at those critical moments when someone asks you to open or close a port in a hurry, either to enable some important traffic or to block an attack. The book will keep the subtle syntax straight and help you remember all the values you have to enter in order to be as secure as possible. The book has an introductory section that describes applications,followed by a reference/encyclopaedic section with all the matches and targets arranged alphabetically.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>The addition of the mouse and the Graphical User Interface made\nthe computer accessible to many more people than would have been\npossible otherwise. Still, \"pointing and clicking\" can be tedious\nwhen performing routine or repetitive tasks. Just as people learn\nto use menu shortcuts (the Alt key) to save time, savvy users and\nadministrators learn to write batch files and scripts to avoid\nhaving to type the same commands over and over. Scripts save time,\nincrease accuracy, and serve as documentation to boot. Windows 7\nand Windows Vista come with scripting, batch file, and command line\ntools that can make a power user or administrator's life easier -\nif she or he knows what they are and how to use them. However, a\ngeneral lack of information and awareness prevent their widespread\nuse. Most current Windows users have no idea how powerful and\neffective these tools can be. The new scripting languages are a\nmystery to most Windows users. And, in Windows 7, most command line\ntools aren't even discussed in the Windows Help system. Microsoft\nhas released a completely new scripting and command line\nenvironment called the Windows PowerShell, but few users are aware\nof its existence, let alone its power and potential.</p></span>",

    "title": "Linux Server Hacks",
    "description": "<span><p>A competent system administrator knows that a Linux server is a high performance system for routing large amounts of information through a network connection.  Setting up and maintaining a Linux server requires understanding not only the hardware, but the ins and outs of the Linux operating system along with its supporting cast of utilities as well as layers of applications software.  There's basic documentation online but there's a lot beyond the basics you have to know, and this only comes from people with hands-on, real-world experience.  This kind of  \"know how\" is what we sought to capture in <i>Linux Server Hacks</i>.<i>Linux Server Hacks</i> is a collection of 100 industrial-strength hacks, providing tips and tools that solve practical problems for Linux system administrators.  Every hack can be read in just a few minutes but will save hours of searching for the right answer. Some of the hacks are subtle, many of them are non-obvious, and all of them demonstrate the power and flexibility of a Linux system.   You'll find hacks devoted to tuning the Linux kernel to make your system run more efficiently, as well as using CVS or RCS to track the revision to system files. You'll learn alternative ways to do backups, how to use system monitoring tools to track system performance and a variety of secure networking solutions. <i>Linux Server Hacks</i> also helps you manage large-scale Web installations running Apache, MySQL, and other open source tools that are typically part of a Linux system.O'Reilly's new Hacks Series proudly reclaims the term \"hacking\" for the good guys. Hackers use their ingenuity to solve interesting problems.  Rob Flickenger is an experienced system administrator, having managed the systems for O'Reilly Network for several years.  (He's also into community wireless networking and he's written a book on that subject for O'Reilly.) Rob has also collected the best ideas and tools from a number of other highly skilled contributors.Written for users who already understand the basics, <i>Linux Server Hacks</i> is built upon the expertise of people who really know what they're doing.</p></span>",

A basic understanding of C programming and experience with systems programming is needed.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Understand the role of the Linux kernel and select an appropriate role for your application</li><li>Use Buildroot and Yocto to create embedded Linux systems quickly and efficiently</li><li>Create customized bootloaders using U-Boot</li><li>Employ perf and ftrace to identify performance bottlenecks</li><li>Understand device trees and make changes to accommodate new hardware on your device</li><li>Write applications that interact with Linux device drivers</li><li>Design and write multi-threaded applications using POSIX threads</li><li>Measure real-time latencies and tune the Linux kernel to minimize them</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Mastering Embedded Linux Programming takes you through the product cycle and gives you an in-depth description of the components and options that are available at each stage. You will begin by learning about toolchains, bootloaders, the Linux kernel, and how to configure a root filesystem to create a basic working device. You will then learn how to use the two most commonly used build systems, Buildroot and Yocto, to speed up and simplify the development process. Building on this solid base, the next section considers how to make best use of raw NAND/NOR flash memory and managed flash eMMC chips, including mechanisms for increasing the lifetime of the devices and to perform reliable in-field updates. Next, you need to consider what techniques are best suited to writing applications for your device. We will then see how functions are split between processes and the usage of POSIX threads, which have a big impact on the responsiveness and performance of the final device The closing sections look at the techniques available to developers for profiling and tracing applications and kernel code using perf and ftrace.</p><p><b>Style and approach </b></p><p>This book is an easy-to-follow and pragmatic guide consisting of an in-depth analysis of the implementation of embedded devices. Each topic has a logical approach to it; this coupled with hints and best practices helps you understand embedded Linux better.</p></span>",

If you use Linux, you have extraordinary\nadvantages: complete source code access, plus an exceptional array\nof optimization tools. But the tools are scattered across the\nInternet. Many are poorly documented. And few experts know how to\nuse them together to solve real problems. Now, one of those experts\nhas written the definitive Linux tuning primer for every\nprofessional: Optimizing Linux® Performance.</p><p>Renowned Linux benchmarking specialist Phillip Ezolt introduces\neach of today's most important Linux optimization tools, showing\nhow they fit into a proven methodology for perfecting overall\napplication performance. Using realistic examples, Ezolt shows\ndevelopers how to pinpoint exact lines of source code that are\nimpacting performance. He teaches sysadmins and application\ndevelopers how to rapidly drill down to specific bottlenecks, so\nthey can implement solutions more quickly. You'll discover how\nto:</p><ul><li><p>Identify bottlenecks even if you're not familiar with the\nunderlying system</p></li><li><p>Find and choose the right performance tools for any problem</p></li><li><p>Recognize the meaning of the events you're measuring</p></li><li><p>Optimize system CPU, user CPU, memory, network I/O, and disk\nI/O—and understand their interrelationships</p></li><li><p>Fix CPU-bound, latency-sensitive, and I/O-bound applications,\nthrough case studies you can easily adapt to your own\nenvironment</p></li></ul><p>Install and use oprofile, the advanced systemwide profiler for\nLinux systems</p><p>If you're new to tuning, Ezolt gives you a clear and practical\nintroduction to all the principles and strategies you'll need.

    "title": "Understanding the Linux Kernel, Second Edition",
    "description": "<span><span><p>\nTo thoroughly understand what makes Linux tick and why it's so\nefficient, you need to delve deep into the heart of the operating\nsystem--into the Linux kernel itself. The kernel is Linux--in the\ncase of the Linux operating system, it's the only bit of software\nto which the term \"Linux\" applies. The kernel handles all the\nrequests or completed I/O operations and determines which programs\nwill share its processing time, and in what order. Responsible for\nthe sophisticated memory management of the whole system, the Linux\nkernel is the force behind the legendary Linux efficiency. The new\nedition of <em>Understanding the Linux Kernel</em> takes you on a\nguided tour through the most significant data structures, many\nalgorithms, and programming tricks used in the kernel. Probing\nbeyond the superficial features, the authors offer valuable\ninsights to people who want to know how things really work inside\ntheir machine. Relevant segments of code are dissected and\ndiscussed line by line. The book covers more than just the\nfunctioning of the code, it explains the theoretical underpinnings\nfor why Linux does things the way it does. The new edition of the\nbook has been updated to cover version 2.4 of the kernel, which is\nquite different from version 2.2: the virtual memory system is\nentirely new, support for multiprocessor systems is improved, and\nwhole new classes of hardware devices have been added. The authors\nexplore each new feature in detail. Other topics in the book\ninclude:\n</p><ul><li><p>Memory management including file buffering, process swapping,\nand Direct memory Access (DMA)</p></li><li><p>The Virtual Filesystem and the Second Extended Filesystem</p></li><li><p>Process creation and scheduling</p></li><li><p>Signals, interrupts, and the essential interfaces to device\ndrivers</p></li><li><p>Timing</p></li><li><p>Synchronization in the kernel</p></li><li><p>Interprocess Communication (IPC)</p></li><li><p>Program execution</p></li></ul><p><em>Understanding the Linux Kernel</em>, Second Edition will acquaint\nyou with all the inner workings of Linux, but is more than just an\nacademic exercise. You'll learn what conditions bring out Linux's\nbest performance, and you'll see how it meets the challenge of\nproviding good system response during process scheduling, file\naccess, and memory management in a wide variety of environments. If\nknowledge is power, then this book will help you make the most of\nyour Linux system.\n</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>GNU/Linux is an immensely popular operating system that is both extremely stable and reliable. But it can also induce minor headaches at the most inopportune times, if you're not fully up to speed with its capabilities.</p><p>A unique approach to running and administering Linux systems, <i>Linux Annoyances for Geeks</i> addresses the many poorly documented and under-appreciated topics that make the difference between a system you struggle with and a system you really enjoy. This book is for power users and system administrators who want to clear away barriers to using Linux for themselves and for less-trained users in their organizations.</p><p>This book meticulously tells you how to get a stubborn wireless card to work under Linux, and reveals little-known sources for wireless driversand information. It tells you how to add extra security to your systems, such as boot passwords, and how to use tools such as rescue disks to overcome overly zealous security measures in a pinch. In everyarea of desktop and server use, the book is chock full of advice based on hard-earned experience.</p><p>Author Michael Jang has spent many hours trying out software in a wide range of environments and carefully documenting solutions for the most popular Linux distributions. (The book focuses on Red Hat/Fedora, SUSE, and Debian.) Many of the topics presented here are previously undocumented or are discussed only in obscure email archives.</p><p>One of the valuable features of this book for system administrators and Linux proponents in general is the organization of step-by-step procedures that they can customize for naive end-users at their sites. Jang has taken into account not only the needs of a sophisticated readership, but the needs of other people those readers may serve.</p><p>Sometimes, a small thing for a user (such as being able to play a CD) or for an administrator (such as updating an organizations' systems from a central server) can make or break the adoption of Linux. This book helps you overcome the most common annoyances in deploying Linux, and trains you in the techniques that will help you overcome other problems you find along the way.</p><p>In keeping with the spirit of the Annoyances series, the book adopts a sympathetic tone that will quickly win you over. Rather than blaming you for possessing limited Linux savvy, <i>Linux Annoyances for Geeks</i> takes you along for a fun-filled ride as you master the system together.</p></div></span></span>",

It is the next-generation of BackTrack, the most popular open-source penetration toolkit in the world. Readers will learn how to think like real attackers, exploit systems, and expose vulnerabilities.</p><p>Even though web applications are developed in a very secure environment and have an intrusion detection system and firewall in place to detect and prevent any malicious activity, open ports are a pre-requisite for conducting online business. These ports serve as an open door for attackers to attack these applications. As a result, penetration testing becomes essential to test the integrity of web-applications. Web Penetration Testing with Kali Linux is a hands-on guide that will give you step-by-step methods on finding vulnerabilities and exploiting web applications.</p><p>\"Web Penetration Testing with Kali Linux\" looks at the aspects of web penetration testing from the mind of an attacker. It provides real-world, practical step-by-step instructions on how to perform web penetration testing exercises.</p><p>You will learn how to use network reconnaissance to pick your targets and gather information. Then, you will use server-side attacks to expose vulnerabilities in web servers and their applications. Client attacks will exploit the way end users use web applications and their workstations. You will also learn how to use open source tools to write reports and get tips on how to sell penetration tests and look out for common pitfalls.</p><p>On the completion of this book, you will have the skills needed to use Kali Linux for web penetration tests and expose vulnerabilities on web applications and clients that access them.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p><em>Debugging Linux Systems</em> discusses the\nmain tools available today to debug 2.6 Linux Kernels. We start by\nexploring the seemingly esoteric operations of the Kernel Debugger\n(KDB), Kernel GNU DeBugger (KGDB), the plain GNU DeBugger (GDB),\nand JTAG debuggers. We then investigate Kernel Probes, a feature\nthat lets you intrude into a kernel function and extract debug\ninformation or apply a medicated patch. Analyzing a crash dump can\nyield clues for postmortem analysis of kernel crashes or hangs, so\nwe take a look at Kdump, a serviceability tool that collects a\nsystem dump after spawning a new kernel. Profiling points you to\ncode regions that burn more CPU cycles, so we learn to use the\nOProfile kernel profiler and the gprof application profiler to\nsense the presence of code bottlenecks. Because tracing provides\ninsight into behavioral problems that manifest during interactions\nbetween different code modules, we delve into the Linux Trace\nToolkit, a system designed for high-volume trace capture.</p><p>The section “Debugging Embedded\nLinux” takes a tour of the I/O interfaces commonly found on\nembedded hardware, such as flash memory, serial port, PCMCIA,\nSecure Digital media, USB, RTC, audio, video, touch screen, and\nBluetooth, and provides pointers to debug the associated device\ndrivers. We also pick up some board-level debugging skills with the\nhelp of a case study. The section “Debugging Network\nThroughput” takes you through some device driver design\nissues and protocol implementation characteristics that can affect\nthe horsepower of your network interface card. We end the shortcut\nby examining several options available in the kernel configuration\nmenu that can emit valuable debug information.</p></span></span>",

Any organization housing a large amount of data or a large infrastructure has started moving cloud-ward - and AWS rules the roost when it comes to cloud service providers, with its closest competitor having less than half of its market share. This highlights the importance of security on the cloud, especially on AWS. While a lot has been said (and written) about how cloud environments can be secured, performing external security assessments in the form of pentests on AWS is still seen as a dark art. \n</p><p>This book aims to help pentesters as well as seasoned system administrators with a hands-on approach to pentesting the various cloud services provided by Amazon through AWS using Kali Linux. To make things easier for novice pentesters, the book focuses on building a practice lab and refining penetration testing with Kali Linux on the cloud. This is helpful not only for beginners but also for pentesters who want to set up a pentesting environment in their private cloud, using Kali Linux to perform a white-box assessment of their own cloud resources. Besides this, the book covers a large variety of AWS services that are often overlooked during a pentest - from serverless infrastructure to automated deployment pipelines.\n</p><p>By the end of this book, you will be able to identify possible vulnerable areas efficiently and secure your AWS cloud environment.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Familiarize yourself with and pentest the most common external-facing AWS services\n</li><li>Audit your own infrastructure and identify flaws, weaknesses, and loopholes\n</li><li>Demonstrate the process of lateral and vertical movement through a partially compromised AWS account\n</li><li>Maintain stealth and persistence within a compromised AWS account\n</li><li>Master a hands-on approach to pentesting\n</li><li>Discover a number of automated tools to ease the process of continuously assessing and improving the security stance of an AWS infrastructure</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>If you are a security analyst or a penetration tester and are interested in exploiting Cloud environments to reveal vulnerable areas and secure them, then this book is for you.</p><p>A basic understanding of penetration testing, cloud computing, and its security concepts is mandatory.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this ebook: You can download the example code files for this ebook on GitHub at the following link: <a href=\"https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-AWS-Penetration-Testing-with-Kali-Linux\">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-AWS-Penetration-Testing-with-Kali-Linux</a>.

The book focuses on quick and efficient prototype building. Some experience with hardware and Embedded Systems is assumed, as is having done some previous work on GNU/Linux systems. Knowledge of scripting on GNU/Linux is expected as well.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Use embedded systems to implement your projects</li><li>Access and manage peripherals for embedded systems</li><li>Program embedded systems using languages such as C, Python, Bash, and PHP</li><li>Use a complete distribution, such as Debian or Ubuntu, or an embedded one, such as OpenWrt or Yocto</li><li>Harness device driver capabilities to optimize device communications</li><li>Access data through several kinds of devices such as GPIO’s, serial ports, PWM, ADC, Ethernet, WiFi, audio, video, I2C, SPI, One Wire, USB and CAN</li><li>Practical example usage of several devices such as RFID readers, Smart card readers, barcode readers, z-Wave devices, GSM/GPRS modems</li><li>Usage of several sensors such as light, pressure, moisture, temperature, infrared, power, motion</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Embedded computers have become very complex in the last few years and developers need to be able to easily manage embedded computer projects by focusing on problem solving; they should not have to waste time finding supported peripherals or learning how to manage them. This book shows you how to interact with external environments through specific peripherals used in the industry. It focuses on the latest Linux kernel release 4 and Debian/Ubuntu distributions (with embedded distributions such as OpenWRT and Yocto).</p><p>This book presents popular and user-friendly boards in the industry – such as Beaglebone Black, Atmel Xplained, Wandboard, and system-on-chip manufacturers – and lets you explore corresponding projects that make use of these boards. You will first program the embedded platforms using the C, Bash, and Python/PHP languages in order to get access to the external peripherals. You will gain a strong foundation in using embedded systems by learning how to program the device driver and access the peripherals. You will also learn how to read and write data from/to the external environment by using C programs or a scripting language (such as Bash/PHP/Python) and see how to configure a device driver for specific hardware.</p><p>The final chapter shows you how to use a micro-controller board – based on the most used microcontroller – to implement real-time or specific tasks that are normally not carried out on the GNU/Linux system. After finishing this book, you will be capable of applying these skills to your personal and professional projects.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This practical tutorial will get you quickly prototyping embedded systems on GNU/Linux. This book uses a variety of hardware to program the peripherals and build simple prototypes.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book.

Yet most\nof these new users draw from Microsoft Windows as their primary\ncomputing experience; for them an operating system from the UNIX\nfamily is an unfamiliar experience. In <em>Learning Red Hat\nLinux</em>, Bill McCarty has written a book aimed specifically at\nthis new audience. <em>Learning Red Hat Linux</em> will guide any new\nuser of Linux through the installing and use of the Red Hat®\nversion of the free operating system that is shaking up the\ncommercial world of software. It demystifies Linux in terms\nfamiliar to Windows users and gives readers only what they need to\nstart being successful users of Linux. Built around the popular Red\nHat distribution of Linux, <em>Learning Red Hat Linux</em> takes the\nreader step by step through the process of installing and setting\nup a Red Hat Linux system, and provides a thorough but gentle\nintroduction to the basics of using Red Hat Linux. Because the book\nis written specifically for the enclosed CD, the reader needs\nnothing else to get started with this exciting new operating\nsystem.\n</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><span><p><b>Beginning Linux Programming, Fourth Edition</b> continues its unique approach to teaching UNIX programming in a simple and structured way on the Linux platform. Through the use of detailed and realistic examples, students learn by doing, and are able to move from being a Linux beginner to creating custom applications in Linux. The book introduces fundamental concepts beginning with the basics of writing Unix programs in C, and including material on basic system calls, file I/O, interprocess communication (for getting programs to work together), and shell programming. Parallel to this, the book introduces the toolkits and libraries for working with user interfaces, from simpler terminal mode applications to X and GTK+ for graphical user interfaces. Advanced topics are covered in detail such as processes, pipes, semaphores, socket programming, using MySQL, writing applications for the GNOME or the KDE desktop, writing device drivers, POSIX Threads, and kernel programming for the latest Linux Kernel.</p></span></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p>Computer security is an ongoing process, a relentless contest between system administrators and intruders.  A good administrator needs to stay one step ahead of any adversaries, which often involves a continuing process of education. If you're grounded in the basics of security, however, you won't necessarily want a complete treatise on the subject each time you pick up a book. Sometimes you want to get straight to the point. That's exactly what the new <i>Linux Security Cookbook</i> does.  Rather than provide a total security solution for Linux computers, the authors present a series of easy-to-follow recipes--short, focused pieces of code that administrators can use to improve security and perform common tasks securely.The <i>Linux Security Cookbook</i> includes real solutions to a wide range of targeted problems, such as sending encrypted email within Emacs, restricting access to network services at particular times of day, firewalling a webserver, preventing IP spoofing, setting up key-based SSH authentication, and much more.  With over 150 ready-to-use scripts and configuration files, this unique book helps administrators secure their systems without having to look up specific syntax. The book begins with recipes devised to establish a secure system, then moves on to secure day-to-day practices, and concludes with techniques to help your system stay secure.Some of the \"recipes\" you'll find in this book are:</p><ul><li>Controlling access to your system from firewalls down to individual services, using iptables, ipchains, xinetd, inetd, and more</li><li>Monitoring your network with tcpdump, dsniff, netstat, and other tools</li><li>Protecting network connections with Secure Shell (SSH) and stunnel</li><li>Safeguarding email sessions with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)</li><li>Encrypting files and email messages with GnuPG</li><li>Probing your own security with password crackers, nmap, and handy scripts</li></ul>This cookbook's proven techniques are derived from hard-won experience. Whether you're responsible for security on a home Linux system or for a large corporation, or somewhere in between, you'll find valuable, to-the-point, practical recipes for dealing with everyday security issues. This book is a system saver.</div></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>This unique and valuable collection of tips, tools, and scripts provides clear, concise, hands-on solutions that can be applied to the challenges facing anyone running a network of Linux servers from small networks to large data centers in the practical and popular problem-solution-discussion O'Reilly cookbook format.The <i>Linux Cookbook</i> covers everything you'd expect: backups, new users, and the like. But it also covers the non-obvious information that is often ignored in other books the time-sinks and headaches that are a real part of an administrator's job, such as: dealing with odd kinds of devices that Linux historically hasn't supported well, building multi-boot systems, and handling things like video and audio.The knowledge needed to install, deploy, and maintain Linux is not easily found, and no Linux distribution gets it just right. Scattered information can be found in a pile of man pages, texinfo files, and source code comments, but the best source of information is the experts themselves who built up a working knowledge of managing Linux systems. This cookbook's proven techniques distill years of hard-won experience into practical cut-and-paste solutions to everyday Linux dilemmas.Use just one  recipe  from this varied collection of real-world solutions, and the hours of tedious trial-and-error saved will more than pay for the cost of the book. But those who prefer to learn hands-on will find that this cookbook not only solves immediate problems quickly, it also cuts right to the chase pointing out potential pitfalls and illustrating tested practices that can be applied to a myriad of other situations.Whether you're responsible for a small Linux system, a huge corporate system, or a mixed Linux/Windows/MacOS network, you'll find valuable, to-the-point, practical recipes for dealing with Linux systems everyday. The <i>Linux Cookbook</i> is more than a time-saver; it's a sanity saver.</p></span></span>",

    "title": "Managing RAID on Linux",
    "description": "<span><div><p>Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) technology is becoming a standard feature of computer systems that support mission-critical services like file sharing, mail exchange, or Web servers. RAID offers two benefits to these essential systems: improved I/O performance and fail-safe data storage.Although bandwidth problems on networks are well documented, the internal data transfer bottleneck that exists at the hardware level in each system can also leave you with perplexing performance issues. RAID is a cost-effective and easy-to-manage way to alleviate this bandwidth problem by distributing the I/O load seamlessly across multiple disks and controllers.RAID also provides uninterrupted data access through disk mirroring and parity algorithms. That means systems can remain online even during a disk or controller failure. RAID is scalable, making it robust enough for large, high-traffic sites and small, critical systems. By using RAID, system administrators can combine single disks into terabytes worth of data storage.<i>Managing RAID on Linux</i> covers everything system administrators need to know to put together a system that can support RAID.  You will learn about the different types of RAID, along with associated technologies and issues, and how to choose the best RAID system for your needs. With a step-by-step, hands-on approach, the author guides you through the installation of either Linux software RAID or a hardware RAID card. The book shows how to build an array and optionally install a high-performance file system. Contents include:</p><ul><li>An introduction to RAID and Linux</li><li>Planning and architecture of your RAID system</li><li>Building a software RAID</li><li>Software RAID tools and references</li><li>Building a hardware RAID</li><li>Performance and tuning of your RAID system</li></ul>RAID has become the low-cost solution of choice to deal with the ever-increasing demand for data storage space.  Written for system administrators, power users, tech managers, and anyone who wants to learn about RAID technology, <i>Managing RAID on Linux</i> sidesteps the often-confusing vendor-specific approach you'll find elsewhere to give you the straight story on RAID. Even non-Linux users will find this book full of valuable material.</div></span>",

    "title": "High Performance Linux Clusters with OSCAR, Rocks, OpenMosix, and MPI",
    "description": "<span><span><div><p>To the outside world, a \"supercomputer\" appears to be a single system. In fact, it's a cluster of computers that share a local area network and have the ability to work together on a single problem as a team. Many businesses used to consider supercomputing beyond the reach of their budgets, but new Linux applications have made high-performance clusters more affordable than ever. These days, the promise of low-cost supercomputing is one of the main reasons many businesses choose Linux over other operating systems.This new guide covers everything a newcomer to clustering will need to plan, build, and deploy a high-performance Linux cluster. The book focuses on clustering for high-performance computation, although much of its information also applies to clustering for high-availability (failover and disaster recovery). The book discusses the key tools you'll need to get started, including good practices to use while exploring the tools and growing a system. You'll learn about planning, hardware choices, bulk installation of Linux on multiple systems, and other basic considerations. Then, you'll learn about software options that can save you hours--or even weeks--of deployment time.Since a wide variety of options exist in each area of clustering software, the author discusses the pros and cons of the major free software projects and chooses those that are most likely to be helpful to new cluster administrators and programmers. A few of the projects introduced in the book include:</p><ul><li>MPI, the most popular programming library for clusters. This book offers simple but realistic introductory examples along with some pointers for advanced use.</li><li>OSCAR and Rocks, two comprehensive installation and administrative systems</li><li>openMosix (a convenient tool for distributing jobs), Linux kernel extensions that migrate processes transparently for load balancing</li><li>PVFS, one of the parallel filesystems that make clustering I/O easier</li><li>C3, a set of commands for administering multiple systems</li></ul>Ganglia, OpenPBS, and cloning tools (Kickstart, SIS and G4U) are also covered. The book looks at cluster installation packages (OSCAR &amp; Rocks) and then considers the core packages individually for greater depth or for folks wishing to do a custom installation.  Guidelines for debugging, profiling, performance tuning, and managing jobs from multiple users round out this immensely useful book.</div></span></span>",

    "title": "Building Secure Servers with Linux",
    "description": "<span><span><p>\nLinux consistently turns up high in the list of popular Internet\nservers, whether it's for the Web, anonymous FTP, or general\nservices like DNS and routing mail. But security is uppermost on\nthe mind of anyone providing such a service. Any server experiences\ncasual probe attempts dozens of time a day, and serious break-in\nattempts with some frequency as well. As the cost of broadband and\nother high-speed Internet connectivity has gone down, and its\navailability has increased, more Linux users are providing or\nconsidering providing Internet services such as HTTP, Anonymous\nFTP, etc., to the world at large. At the same time, some important,\npowerful, and popular Open Source tools have emerged and rapidly\nmatured--some of which rival expensive commercial\nequivalents--making Linux a particularly appropriate platform for\nproviding secure Internet services. <em>Building Secure Servers with\nLinux</em> will help you master the principles of reliable system\nand network security by combining practical advice with a firm\nknowledge of the technical tools needed to ensure security. The\nbook focuses on the most common use of Linux--as a hub offering\nservices to an organization or the larger Internet--and shows\nreaders how to harden their hosts against attacks. Author Mick\nBauer, a security consultant, network architect, and lead author of\nthe popular Paranoid Penguin column in Linux Journal, carefully\noutlines the security risks, defines precautions that can minimize\nthose risks, and offers recipes for robust security. The book does\nnot cover firewalls, but covers the more common situation where an\norganization protects its hub using other systems as firewalls,\noften proprietary firewalls. The book includes:\n</p><ul><li><p>Precise directions for securing common services, including the\nWeb, mail, DNS, and file transfer.</p></li><li><p>Ancillary tasks, such as hardening Linux, using SSH and\ncertificates for tunneling, and using iptables for\nfirewalling.</p></li><li><p>Basic installation of intrusion detection tools.</p></li></ul><p>\nWriting for Linux users with little security expertise, the author\nexplains security concepts and techniques in clear language,\nbeginning with the fundamentals. <em>Building Secure Servers with\nLinux</em> provides a unique balance of \"big picture\" principles\nthat transcend specific software packages and version numbers, and\nvery clear procedures on securing some of those software packages.\nAn all-inclusive resource for Linux users who wish to harden their\nsystems, the book covers general security as well as key services\nsuch as DNS, the Apache Web server, mail, file transfer, and secure\nshell. With this book in hand, you'll have everything you need to\nensure robust security of your Linux system.\n</p></span></span>",

Each is the result of a publicly collaborative process among numerous developers who volunteer their time and energy to create better software.</p><p>The truth is, however, that the overwhelming majority of free software projects fail.  To help you beat the odds, O'Reilly has put together <i>Producing Open Source Software</i>, a guide that recommends tried and true steps to help free software developers work together toward a common goal.  Not just for developers who are considering starting their own free software project, this book will also help those who want to participate in the process at any level.</p><p>The book tackles this very complex topic by distilling it down into easily understandable parts.  Starting with the basics of project management, it details specific tools used in free software projects, including version control, IRC, bug tracking, and Wikis.  Author Karl Fogel, known for his work on CVS and Subversion, offers practical advice on how to set up and use a range of tools in combination with open mailing lists and archives.  He also provides several chapters on the essentials of recruiting and motivating developers, as well as how to gain much-needed publicity for your project.</p><p>While managing a team of enthusiastic developers -- most of whom you've never even met -- can be challenging, it can also be fun.  <i>Producing Open Source Software</i> takes this into account, too, as it speaks of the sheer pleasure to be had from working with a motivated team of free software developers.</p></div></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><b>Kali Linux: a complete pentesting toolkit facilitating smooth backtracking for working hackers</b></p><p><b>About This Book</b></p><ul><li>Conduct network testing, surveillance, pen testing and forensics on MS Windows using Kali Linux</li><li>Footprint, monitor, and audit your network and investigate any ongoing infestations</li><li>Customize Kali Linux with this professional guide so it becomes your pen testing toolkit</li></ul><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>If you are a working ethical hacker who is looking to expand the offensive skillset with a thorough understanding of Kali Linux, then this is the book for you. Prior knowledge about Linux operating systems and the BASH terminal emulator along with Windows desktop and command line would be highly beneficial.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Set up Kali Linux for pen testing</li><li>Map and enumerate your Windows network</li><li>Exploit several common Windows network vulnerabilities</li><li>Attack and defeat password schemes on Windows</li><li>Debug and reverse-engineer Windows programs</li><li>Recover lost files, investigate successful hacks and discover hidden data in innocent-looking files</li><li>Catch and hold admin rights on the network, and maintain backdoors on the network after your initial testing is done</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Microsoft Windows is one of the two most common OS and managing its security has spawned the discipline of IT security. Kali Linux is the premier platform for testing and maintaining Windows security. Kali is built on the Debian distribution of Linux and shares the legendary stability of that OS. This lets you focus on using the network penetration, password cracking, forensics tools and not the OS.</p><p>This book has the most advanced tools and techniques to reproduce the methods used by sophisticated hackers to make you an expert in Kali Linux penetration testing. First, you are introduced to Kali's top ten tools and other useful reporting tools. Then, you will find your way around your target network and determine known vulnerabilities to be able to exploit a system remotely. Next, you will prove that the vulnerabilities you have found are real and exploitable. You will learn to use tools in seven categories of exploitation tools. Further, you perform web access exploits using tools like websploit and more. Security is only as strong as the weakest link in the chain. Passwords are often that weak link. Thus, you learn about password attacks that can be used in concert with other approaches to break into and own a network. Moreover, you come to terms with network sniffing, which helps you understand which users are using services you can exploit, and IP spoofing, which can be used to poison a system's DNS cache. Once you gain access to a machine or network, maintaining access is important.</p><p>Thus, you not only learn penetrating in the machine you also learn Windows privilege's escalations. With easy to follow step-by-step instructions and support images, you will be able to quickly pen test your system and network.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This book is a hands-on guide for Kali Linux pen testing. This book will provide all the practical knowledge needed to test your network's security using a proven hacker's methodology. The book uses easy-to-understand yet professional language for explaining concepts.</p></span>",

Curiosity increased the demand for investigating the Open Source world for Community Open Source and Enterprise grade applications. IBM as one of the contributors to the Open Source community is interested in helping the software be maintained and supported. Having companies, such as IBM, support the evolution of Open Source software helps to keep the Open Source community striving for enterprise grade open source solutions.</p><p>Lately, companies are working on deciphering how to take advantage of Enterprise and Community Open Source to implement in their enterprises. The business case for open source software is no longer a mystery and no surprise that most of the new positions in IT enterprises are related to open source projects. <br/>The ability of a large enterprise to manage this sort of implementations is to engage in a hypertrophied cooperation, where the ability to not only cooperate with teams and people outside your organization, but also to find new ways of working together and devise new ways to improve the software and its code. </p><p>A goal for this publication is to help the client's journey into the open source space and implement a private Cloud Container-based architecture with the ability to manage the entire IT Service Management processes from the open source framework. </p><p>This publication describes the architecture and implementation details of the solution. Although not every piece of this solution is documented here, this book does provide instructions for what was achieved incorporating open source technologies. </p><p>Moreover, with this publication, the team shares their collaboration experiences working in a team of technologists, open source developers, Red Hat, and the open source community.</p><p>This publication is for designers, developers, managers, and anyone who is considering starting a Cloud open source project, or users who started that journey. This book also can be a manual to guide the implementation of a technical viable architecture and help those enterprises participate in an open source project but have not done so before. </p><p>The reader must be familiar with principles in programming and basic software engineering concepts, such as source code, compilers, and patches.</p></span>",

Shell is a program that gives the user direct interaction with the operating system. Scripts are collections of commands that are stored in a file. The shell reads this file and acts on commands as if they were typed on the keyboard.</p><p>Learning Linux Shell Scripting covers Bash, GNU Bourne Again Shell, preparing you to work in the exciting world of Linux shell scripting. CentOS is a popular rpm-based stable and secured Linux distribution. Therefore, we have used CentOS distribution instead of Ubuntu distribution. Linux Shell Scripting is independent of Linux distributions, but we have covered both types of distros. We start with an introduction to the Shell environment and basic commands used. Next, we explore process management in Linux OS, real-world essentials such as debugging and perform Shell arithmetic fluently. You'll then take a step ahead and learn new and advanced topics in Shell scripting, such as decision making, starting up a system, and customizing a Linux environment. You will also learn about grep, stream editor, and AWK, which are very powerful text filters and editors. Finally, you'll get to grips with taking backup, using other language scripts in Shell Scripts as well as automating database administration tasks for MySQL and Oracle.</p><p>By the end of this book, you will be able to confidently use your own shell scripts in the real world.</p><b>Style and approach</b><p>This practical book will go from the very basics of shell scripting to complex, customized automation. The idea behind this book is to be as practical as possible and give you the look and feel of what real-world scripting is like.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book You can download the example code files for all Packt books you have purchased from your account at http://www.PacktPub.com.

With Kali Linux, you can apply the appropriate testing methodology with defined business objectives and a scheduled test plan, resulting in successful penetration testing project engagement.\n</p><p>This fourth edition of Kali Linux 2018: Assuring Security by Penetration Testing starts with the installation of Kali Linux. You will be able to create a full test environment to safely practice scanning, vulnerability assessment, and exploitation. You'll explore the essentials of penetration testing by collecting relevant data on the target network with the use of several footprinting and discovery tools.

Why? There are many reasons including: A lot of network operating systems are based on Linux, or have a Linux shell you can access, or use Linux type commands. The author shows you an example using Cisco, Arista, and Cumulus Linux. Network Automation tools such as Ansible don't run the command node on Windows. You are probably going to use Linux with tools such as Ansible, Netmkio, NAPALM and other network automation tools. SDN controllers such as OpenDaylight, ONOS, RYU and APIC-EM run on Linux. You will find that many SDN tools require Linux. DevOps tools such as git work best with Linux. IoT devices typically run Linux. A new breed of network devices from companies like Facebook, Microsoft and Cumulus Linux use Linux.</p><p>There are even more reasons, but make sure you don't get left behind! You as a network engineer start learning Linux. Learn how to configure Linux networking, how to create users and assign permissions, how to install and run Linux services such as DNS and DHCP.</p><p>The course uses various GNS3 topologies with devices such as:</p><ul><li>Linux Docker containers</li><li>Linux GNS3 QEMU virtual machines</li><li>Traditional Linux virtual machines</li><li>Network devices - you could use Cisco, Arista, Cumulus Linux or others</li></ul><p>Do you want to see something else added to the course? Just let me know. I like to get your feedback on ways I can improve the course and add more content that you think is relevant.</p><p>Networking is changing. Make sure you keep up to date!

Everything on this course is available in the <a href=\"https://github.com/alfredodeza/python-cli-tools-course\">course Repository on GitHub</a>, so that you can follow the examples closely and use that as a foundation with all examples and sample files.</p><p><strong>Building a CLI is the foundation for automation in your daily work</strong></p><p>By the end of the course you should feel confident in creating a tool, and the following:</p><ul><li>Create simple CLI tools without any frameworks</li><li>Learn about arguments, flags, help menus and how to create them automatically</li><li>Use the <code>argparse</code> framework to build more complex tools</li><li>Build a CLI with the Click framework</li><li>Use special features of Click like colored output and argument types</li><li>Modularizing and project scaffolding in Python</li><li>Packaging and packaging files in Python</li><li>How to create tests and run them automatically</li><li>Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment with Github Actions for Python</li><li>Packaging a CLI tool with an executable</li><li>Distributing a CLI tool on PyPI (the Python Package Index)</li><li>How to automatically test your project on a PR (GitHub pull request)</li><li>How to automate publishing your tool to PyPI on a release</li></ul><p>We'll cover 3 different ways to create tools, from the very basic (with <code>sys.argv</code>) to using a framework that comes with Python (<code>argparse</code>), and finally the more involved, by using an external library like <a href=\"https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/\">Click</a>. This flexibility is essential because it will let you decide when to use a simple single file with no dependencies to a fully featured framework like Click.</p><p>Then you will learn about the project layout, modularizing and organizing your code in directories and files while keeping everything useful for a CLI. You will test your code using Pytest and then package your code using Python packaging files and tools. You will continue by automating everything, including the testing and linting using GitHub Actions, and finally publishing your project to the Python Package Index so that it can be installed by anyone in the world.</p>Course Resources<ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/alfredodeza/python-cli-tools-course\">Course Repository on GitHub</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/python-language/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza\">Build Python applications from scratch</a></li></ul></span>",

You should be familiar with how to set up a Linux server and how to install additional software on them.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Route an IPv6 netblock to your local network</li><li>Modify your named instance to support setting hostnames for your IPv6 addresses</li><li>Use SSH for remote console access</li><li>Configure NGINX with TLS</li><li>Secure XMPP with TLS</li><li>Leverage iptables6 to firewall your IPv6 traffic</li><li>Configure Samba as an Active Directory compatible directory service</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Linux can be configured as a networked workstation, a DNS server, a mail server, a firewall, a gateway router, and many other things. These are all part of administration tasks, hence network administration is one of the main tasks of Linux system administration. By knowing how to configure system network interfaces in a reliable and optimal manner, Linux administrators can deploy and configure several network services including file, web, mail, and servers while working in large enterprise environments.</p><p>Starting with a simple Linux router that passes traffic between two private networks, you will see how to enable NAT on the router in order to allow Internet access from the network, and will also enable DHCP on the network to ease configuration of client systems. You will then move on to configuring your own DNS server on your local network using bind9 and tying it into your DHCP server to allow automatic configuration of local hostnames. You will then future enable your network by setting up IPv6 via tunnel providers.</p><p>Moving on, we'll configure Samba to centralize authentication for your network services; we will also configure Linux client to leverage it for authentication, and set up a RADIUS server that uses the directory server for authentication.</p><p>Toward the end, you will have a network with a number of services running on it, and will implement monitoring in order to detect problems as they occur.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This book is packed with practical recipes and a task-based approach that will walk you through building, maintaining, and securing a computer network using Linux.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Reveals and illustrates the awesome power and flexibility of the command line, and the design and usage philosophies that support those traits. This understanding of how to extract the most from the Linux command line can help you become a better SysAdmin. Understand <i>why</i> many things in the Linux and Unix worlds are done as they are, and how to apply the Linux Philosophy to working as a SysAdmin.</p><p>The original Unix/Linux Philosophy presented foundational and functional tenets - rules, guidelines, and procedural methods - that worked well. However, it was intended for the developers of those operating systems. Although System Administrators could apply many of the tenets to their daily work, many important tenets were missing.</p><p>Over the years that David Both has been working with Linux and Unix, he has formulated his own philosophy – one which applies more directly to the everyday life of the System Administrator. This book defines a philosophy, and then illuminates the practical aspects of that philosophy with real-world experiments you can perform. Inspired by David’s real mentors, and dedicated to them, <i>The Linux Philosophy for System Administrators</i> is a mentor to SysAdmins everywhere; remember - \"If you fail you learn.\"</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><p></p><ul><li>Apply the Linux philosophy to working as a SysAdmin<br/></li><li>Unlock the power of the knowledge you already have<br/></li><li>Fully understand and access the vast power of the command line<br/></li><li>Review the power of Linux as a function of the philosophies that built it<br/></li></ul><p></p><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>If you want to learn the secrets that make the best Linux SysAdmins powerful far beyond that of mere mortals; if you want to understand the concepts that unlock those secrets; if you want to be the SysAdmin that everyone else turns to when the bytes hit the fan – then this book is for you. </p></span>",

No previous knowledge of high-availability systems is needed, though the reader is expected to have at least some degree of familiarity with any spin-off of the Fedora family of Linux distributions, preferably CentOS.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Install a CentOS 7 cluster and network infrastructure</li><li>Configure firewall, networking, and clustering services and settings</li><li>Set up and test a HAC (high-availability cluster) to host an Apache web server and a MariaDB database server</li><li>Monitor performance and availability</li><li>Identify bottlenecks and troubleshoot issues</li><li>Improve performance and ensure high availability</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>CentOS is the enterprise level Linux OS, which is 100% binary compatible to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). It acts as a free alternative to RedHat's commercial Linux offering, with only a change in the branding. A high performance cluster consists in a group of computers that work together as one set parallel, hence minimizing or eliminating the downtime of critical services and enhancing the performance of the application.</p><p>Starting with the basic principles of clustering, you will learn the necessary steps to install a cluster with two CentOS 7 servers. We will then set up and configure the basic required network infrastructure and clustering services. Further, you will learn how to take a proactive approach to the split-brain issue by configuring the failover and fencing of the cluster as a whole and the quorum of each node individually. Further, we will be setting up HAC and HPC clusters as a web server and a database server. You will also master the art of monitoring performance and availability, identifying bottlenecks, and exploring troubleshooting techniques.</p><p>At the end of the book, you'll review performance-tuning techniques for the recently installed cluster, test performance using a payload simulation, and learn the necessary skills to ensure that the systems, and the corresponding resources and services, are being utilized to their best capacity.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>An easy-to-follow and step-by-step guide with hands-on instructions to set up real-world simple cluster scenarios that will start you on the path to building more complex applications on your own.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>The discipline of public administration draws predominantly from political and organizational theory, but also from other social and behavioral sciences, philosophy, and even theology. This diversity results in conflicting prescriptions for the \"proper\" administrative role. So, how are those new to public administration to know which ideas are \"legitimate\"?</p><p/><p>Rather than accepting conventional arguments for administrative legitimacy through delegated constitutional authority or expertise, <strong>Logics of Legitimacy: Three Traditions of Public Administration Praxis</strong> does not assume that any one approach to professionalism is accepted by all scholars, practitioners, citizens, or elected representatives. Instead, it offers a framework for public administration theory and practice that fully includes the citizen as a political actor alongside elected representatives and administrators. This framework:</p><p/><ul><p>\n</p><li>Considers both direct and representative forms of democracy</li><li>Examines concepts from both political and organizational theory, addressing many of the key questions in public administration</li><li>Examines past and present approaches to administration</li><li>Presents a conceptual lens for understanding public administration theory and explaining different administrative roles and practices</li><p/></ul><p/><p>The framework for public administration theory and practice is presented in three traditions of main prescriptions for practice: Constitutional (the bureaucrat), Discretionary (the entrepreneur), and Collaborative (the steward). This book is appropriate for use in graduate-level courses that explore the philosophical, historical, and intellectual foundations of public administration. Upon qualified course adoption, instructors will gain access to a course outline and corresponding lecture slides.</p><p/></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p>\nThis book is for anyone who wants to support computer peripherals\nunder the Linux operating system or who wants to develop new\nhardware and run it under Linux. Linux is the fastest-growing\nsegment of the Unix market, is winning over enthusiastic adherents\nin many application areas, and is being viewed more and more as a\ngood platform for embedded systems. <em>Linux Device Drivers,</em>\nalready a classic in its second edition, reveals information that\nheretofore has been shared by word of mouth or in cryptic source\ncode comments, on how to write drivers for a wide range of devices.\nVersion 2.4 of the Linux kernel includes significant changes to\ndevice drivers, simplifying many activities, but providing subtle\nnew features that can make a driver both more efficient and more\nflexible. The second edition of this book thoroughly covers these\nchanges, as well as new processors and buses. You don't have to be\na kernel hacker to understand and enjoy this book; all you need is\nan understanding of C and some background in Unix system calls.\nYou'll learn how to write drivers for character devices, block\ndevices, and network interfaces, guided by full-featured examples\nthat you can compile and run without special hardware. Major\nchanges in the second edition include discussions of symmetric\nmultiprocessing (SMP) and locking, new CPUs, and recently supported\nbuses. For those who are curious about how an operating system does\nits job, this book provides insights into address spaces,\nasynchronous events, and I/O. Portability is a major concern in the\ntext. The book is centered on version 2.4, but includes information\nfor kernels back to 2.0 where feasible. <em>Linux Device Driver</em>\nalso shows how to maximize portability among hardware platforms;\nexamples were tested on IA32 (PC) and IA64, PowerPC, SPARC and\nSPARC64, Alpha, ARM, and MIPS. Contents include:\n</p><li><p>Building a driver and loading modules</p></li><li><p>Complete character, block, and network drivers</p></li><li><p>Debugging a driver</p></li><li><p>Timing</p></li><li><p>Handling symmetric multiprocessing (SMP)\nsystems</p></li><li><p>Memory management and DMA</p></li><li><p>Interrupts</p></li><li><p>Portability issues</p></li><li><p>Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI)</p></li></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Real Application Clusters (RAC) and the Grid architecture are Oracle's strategy for scaling out enterprise systems to cope with bigger workloads and more users. Many books limit themselves by conceptualizing and theorizing about RAC technology, but this book is the first to portray implementing and administering an Oracle 10<i>g</i> RAC system in a Linux environment. This book features basic concepts underlying Linux and Oracle RAC, design strategies, hardware procurement and configuration, and many other topics.</p><p>The RAC-specific technologies described include configuration of the interconnect, OCFS, ASM, Cluster Ready Services, and Grid Control. The Oracle features RMAN and Data Guard are also discussed, along with available hardware options. The authors include practical examples and configuration information, so that upon reading this book, you'll be armed with the information you need to build an Oracle RAC database on Linux, whether it is on a single laptop or a 64-node Itanium cluster.</p></span>",

Simultaneously\nbecoming more user friendly and more powerful as a back-end system,\nLinux has achieved new plateaus: the newer filesystems have\nsolidified, new commands and tools have appeared and become\nstandard, and the desktop--including new desktop environments--have\nproved to be viable, stable, and readily accessible to even those\nwho don't consider themselves computer gurus.\n</p><p>Whether you're using Linux for personal software projects, for a\nsmall office or home office (often termed the SOHO environment), to\nprovide services to a small group of colleagues, or to administer a\nsite responsible for millions of email and web connections each\nday, you need quick access to information on a wide range of tools.\nThis book covers all aspects of administering and making effective\nuse of Linux systems. Among its topics are booting, package\nmanagement, and revision control. But foremost in <em>Linux in a\nNutshell</em> are the utilities and commands that make Linux one of\nthe most powerful and flexible systems available.</p><p>Now in its fifth edition, <em>Linux in a Nutshell</em> brings\nusers up-to-date with the current state of Linux. Considered by\nmany to be the most complete and authoritative command reference\nfor Linux available, the book covers all substantial user,\nprogramming, administration, and networking commands for the most\ncommon Linux distributions.</p><p>Comprehensive but concise, the fifth edition has been updated to\ncover new features of major Linux distributions. Configuration\ninformation for the rapidly growing commercial network services and\ncommunity update services is one of the subjects covered for the\nfirst time.</p><p>But that's just the beginning. The book covers editors, shells,\nand LILO and GRUB boot options. There's also coverage of Apache,\nSamba, Postfix, sendmail, CVS, Subversion, Emacs, vi, sed, gawk,\nand much more. Everything that system administrators, developers,\nand power users need to know about Linux is referenced here, and\nthey will turn to this book again and again.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><span><p>\nLinux consistently appears high up in the list of popular Internet\nservers, whether it's for the Web, anonymous FTP, or general\nservices such as DNS and delivering mail. But security is the\nforemost concern of anyone providing such a service. Any server\nexperiences casual probe attempts dozens of time a day, and serious\nbreak-in attempts with some frequency as well. This highly regarded\nbook, originally titled <em>Building Secure Servers with Linux</em>,\ncombines practical advice with a firm knowledge of the technical\ntools needed to ensure security. The book focuses on the most\ncommon use of Linux--as a hub offering services to an organization\nor the Internet--and shows readers how to harden their hosts\nagainst attacks. An all-inclusive resource for Linux users who wish\nto harden their systems, <em>Linux Server Security</em> covers\ngeneral security such as intrusion detection and firewalling a hub,\nas well as key services such as DNS, the Apache Web server, mail,\nand secure shell. Author Michael D. Bauer, a security consultant,\nnetwork architect, and lead author of the popular Paranoid Penguin\ncolumn in the <em>Linux Journal</em>, carefully outlines the security\nrisks, defines precautions that can minimize those risks, and\noffers recipes for robust security. He is joined on several\nchapters by administrator and developer Bill Lubanovic. A number of\nnew security topics have been added for this edition, including:\n</p><ul><li><p>Database security, with a focus on MySQL</p></li><li><p>Using OpenLDAP for authentication</p></li><li><p>An introduction to email encryption</p></li><li><p>The Cyrus IMAP service, a popular mail delivery agent</p></li><li><p>The vsftpd FTP server</p></li></ul><p>\nGeared toward Linux users with little security expertise, the\nauthor explains security concepts and techniques in clear language,\nbeginning with the fundamentals. <em>Linux Server Security</em> with\nLinux provides a unique balance of \"big picture\" principles that\ntranscend specific software packages and version numbers, and very\nclear procedures on securing some of those software packages on\nseveral popular distributions. With this book in hand, you'll have\nboth the expertise and the tools to comprehensively secure your\nLinux system.\n</p></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p><b>Praise for Marcel Gagné’s <em>Moving to Linux: Kiss\nthe Blue Screen of Death Goodbye!</em></b></p><p>\n“This is kind of a funny book for me to be recommending to\nreaders of a Windows newsletter, but a lot of people ask me about\nthis topic, so here goes. Author Marcel Gagné is a columnist\nfor <em>Linux Journal</em>, and in <b><em>Moving to Linux</em></b>\nhe’s prepared a step-by-step guide to converting a Windows PC\nto Linux—or just trying it! The book includes a bootable CD\nwith a version of Linux that you can poke around in without\ntouching or changing anything about your Windows installation. If\nyour boss is asking, ‘What’s with this Linux\nstuff?’, moving to Linux is a great way to show that you know\nwhat you’re talking about.”<br/><em>—Brian Livingston, Editor, WindowsSecrets.com</em>\n</p><p>\n“Pros: Too many to list in the available space. We liked\nthe book from the very first page right through to the end.\nGagné has done a solid job of exposing Linux and all its\ncomponents in a way that is both inviting, useful, and easy to\nunderstand . . . We really liked this book—highly\nrecommended.”<br/><em>—Howard Carson, Kickstart News,\nwww.kickstartnews.com</em>\n</p><p>\n“Marcel walks the user through each technique in a very\nchatty and comfortable style. In fact, when I put the book down, I\nhad a momentary impression that I’d just finished watching a\ngood cooking show with an entertaining chef. (Australian readers\nmay understand if I say that it felt like having just watched Ian\nParmenter do an episode of ‘Consuming\nPassions.’)”<br/><em>—Jenn Vesperman, Linuxchix.org</em>\n</p><p>\n“Gagné’s <b><em>Moving to Linux</em></b> is a\nstraightforward exposition of just how a non-hacker PC user can get\nrid of ‘The Blue Screen of Death’. If you have a\nfriend, a co-worker, a significant other, or a relative who\nperiodically screams, sighs, bursts into tears, or asks for help,\nhere’s the simple solution. It comes with a bootable CD of\nKnoppix, Klaus Knopper’s variant of Debian.”<br/><em>—Peter H. Salus, writing in ;login: The Usenix\nMagazine</em>\n</p><p>\n“This is a book aimed not at you, dear\ndeveloper/techie/guru, but at your friends, acquaintances, and\nfamily who are lowly users of Windows. Yes, such people do exist\neven in the tightest of families. Fear not, however, because\nsalvation is at hand should any of them decide that this Linux\nthing might be worth investigating. No longer will you be faced\nwith the unenviable task of walking them through the process of\nswitching OS. <em><b>Moving to Linux: Kiss the Blue Screen of Death\nGoodbye!</b></em> is a big, bold, and friendly guide to help them\nalong.

    "description": "<span><p><em>Linux in a Nutshell</em>, now in its fourth edition, has won\nawards in the Linux community as the most indispensable book about\nLinux. It is an essential desktop reference for the commands that\nusers of Linux utilize every day, with the depth of information and\nthe practical, succinct \"In a Nutshell\" format that made the\nprevious editions so popular. Comprehensive but concise, <em>Linux\nin a Nutshell</em> covers all substantial user, programming,\nadministration, and networking commands for the most common Linux\ndistributions. It's several quick references rolled into one: sed,\ngawk, RCS, CVS, vi, Emacs, bash, tcsh, regular expressions, package\nmanagement, bootloaders, and desktop environments are all covered\nin this clear, to-the-point volume, along with core command-line\nutilities. The fourth edition continues to track the major changes\nin bootloaders, the GNOME and KDE desktops, and general Unix\ncommands. Several commands related to CDs and music reflect the\nevolution of multimedia on Linux. Coverage has been added for GRUB,\nwhich has become the default bootloader on several Linux\ndistributions, and for vim, the popular and feature-loaded\nextension to vi. The addition of several new options to the\niptables firewall command and new commands related to DNSSEC and\nssh show the book's value as a security tool. With this book, you\nno longer have to grope through long manpages and info documents\nfor the information you need; you'll find it here in clear language\nand an easy-to-read format. Contents include:\n</p><li><p>Programming, system administration, networking, and user\ncommands with complete lists of options</p></li><li><p>GRUB, LILO, and Loadlin bootloaders</p></li><li><p>Shell syntax and variables for the bash, csh, and tcsh\nshells</p></li><li><p>Pattern matching</p></li><li><p>Emacs, vi, and vim editing commands</p></li><li><p>sed and gawk commands</p></li><li><p>The GNOME and KDE desktops and the fvwm2 window manager</p></li><li><p>Red Hat and Debian package managers</p></li></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>\nOnce a little-known productivity boost for personal computers,\nLinux is now becoming a central part of computing environments\neverywhere. This operating system now serves as corporate hubs, Web\nservers, academic research platforms, and program development\nsystems. All along it's also managed to keep its original role as\nan enjoyable environment for personal computing, learning system\nadministration and programming skills, and all-around hacking. This\nbook, now in its third edition, has been widely recognized for\nyears in the Linux community as the getting-started book people\nneed. It goes into depth about configuration issues that often trip\nup users but are glossed over by other books. A complete,\nUNIX-compatible operating system developed by volunteers on the\nInternet, Linux is distributed freely in electronic form and at a\nlow cost from many vendors. Developed first on the PC, it has been\nported to many other architectures and can now support such\nheavy-duty features as multiprocessing, RAID, and clustering.\nSoftware packages on Linux include the Samba file server and Apache\nWeb server; the X Window System (X11R6); TCP/IP networking\n(including PPP, SSH, and NFS support); popular software tools such\nas Emacs and TeX; a complete software development environment\nincluding C, C++, Java, Perl, Tcl/Tk, and Python; libraries,\ndebuggers, multimedia support, scientific and database\napplications, and much more. Commercial applications that run on\nLinux range from end-user tools like word processors and\nspreadsheets to mission-critical software like the Oracle, Sybase,\nInformix, and IBM DB/2 database management systems. <em>Running\nLinux</em> has all the information you need to understand, install,\nand start using the Linux operating system. This includes a\ncomprehensive installation tutorial, complete information on system\nmaintenance, tools for document development and programming, and\nguidelines for network, file, printer, and Web site administration.\nNew topics in the third edition include:\n</p><ul><li><p>KDE, a desktop that brings the friendliness and ease-of-use of\nWindows or the Macintosh to Linux</p></li><li><p>Samba, which turns Linux into an office hub that serves files\nand printers to Microsoft systems</p></li><li><p>PPP, the most popular software for logging into remote systems\nover phone lines</p></li><li><p>Revised instructions for installation and configuration,\nparticularly covering the Red Hat, SuSE and Debian\ndistributions</p></li></ul></span></span>",

For programmers without UNIX experience, it will be\neven more valuable. The second section covers material that is\nentirely Linux specific.

It also targets administrators and support personnel who\nare responsible for supporting client systems. This book can also\nbe helpful to anyone who is evaluating the potential of using Linux\nfor enterprise client systems. However, the key focus is on\nenvironments where OS/2 is currently used.</p><p>Many enterprises have been using OS/2 as a stable platform for\ncritical enterprise client applications. However, as those\nenterprises look to the future, they look for a platform on which\nthey can build a strategy that is open, standards-based, secure,\nand provides a cost-effective solution. Linux has become successful\nas a server platform in many of these same enterprises. It comes as\nno surprise that these enterprises also want to evaluate the\npossibility of including Linux for many of their client\nsystems.</p><p>This book describes platform and functional considerations for\nchoosing Linux as a client platform. It examines techniques and\nfacilities for administering Linux clients, coexistence of Linux\nclients with other platforms, and a technique to easily install\nLinux clients based on the well-known OS/2-based CID\nmethodology.</p><p>Please note that the additional material referenced in the text is not available from IBM.</p></span>",

This book provides a comprehensive introduction for those new to Linux device driver development and will have you up and running with writing misc class character device driver code (on the 5.4 LTS Linux kernel) in next to no time.</p><p>You'll begin by learning how to write a simple and complete misc class character driver before interfacing your driver with user-mode processes via procfs, sysfs, debugfs, netlink sockets, and ioctl. You'll then find out how to work with hardware I/O memory. The book covers working with hardware interrupts in depth and helps you understand interrupt request (IRQ) allocation, threaded IRQ handlers, tasklets, and softirqs. You'll also explore the practical usage of useful kernel mechanisms, setting up delays, timers, kernel threads, and workqueues. Finally, you'll discover how to deal with the complexity of kernel synchronization with locking technologies (mutexes, spinlocks, and atomic/refcount operators), including more advanced topics such as cache effects, a primer on lock-free techniques, deadlock avoidance (with lockdep), and kernel lock debugging techniques.</p><p>By the end of this Linux kernel book, you'll have learned the fundamentals of writing Linux character device driver code for real-world projects and products.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Get to grips with the basics of the modern Linux Device Model (LDM)</li><li>Write a simple yet complete misc class character device driver</li><li>Perform user-kernel interfacing using popular methods</li><li>Understand and handle hardware interrupts confidently</li><li>Perform I/O on peripheral hardware chip memory</li><li>Explore kernel APIs to work with delays, timers, kthreads, and workqueues</li><li>Understand kernel concurrency issues</li><li>Work with key kernel synchronization primitives and discover how to detect and avoid deadlock</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>An understanding of the topics covered in the Linux Kernel Programming book is highly recommended to make the most of this book. This book is for Linux programmers beginning to find their way with device driver development. Linux device driver developers looking to overcome frequent and common kernel/driver development issues, as well as perform common driver tasks such as user-kernel interfaces, performing peripheral I/O, handling hardware interrupts, and dealing with concurrency will benefit from this book. A basic understanding of Linux kernel internals (and common APIs), kernel module development, and C programming is required.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>This IBM® Redbooks® publication is Volume 2 of a five-volume series of books entitled The Virtualization Cookbook for IBM Z®. </p><p>This volume includes the following chapters: <br/></p><ul><br/><li>Chapter 1, \"Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux on LNXADMIN\" on page 3, describes how to install and configure Red Hat Enterprise Linux onto the Linux Administration server, which performs the cloning and other tasks.<br/></li><li>Chapter 2, \"Automated Red Hat Enterprise Linux installations by using Kickstart\" on page 37, describes how to use Red Hat's kickstart tool to create Linux systems. This tool is fundamentally different from cloning in that an automated installation is implemented. You can try kickstart and cloning. Understand that these applications attempt to accomplish the same goal of quickly getting Linux systems up and running, and that you do not need to use both.<br/></li><li>Chapter 3, \"Working with subscription-manager, yum, and DaNdiFied\" on page 47, describes how the Red Hat Network works. It provides centralized management and provisioning for multiple Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems.<br/></li></ul><br/>Kickstart is an easy and fast way to provision your Linux guests in any supported Linux platform. It re-creates the operating system from the beginning by using the kickstart profile configuration file that installs the new operating system unattended. It also sets up the new guest according to the definition that was set up in the kickstart file.<p>Usually, Linux is administered by the same team that manages Linux on all platforms. By using kickstart, you can create a basic profile that can be used in all supported platforms and customize Linux profiles, as needed. </p><p>Cloning requires a better understanding of the z/VM environment and z/VM skills. It is a fast process if you enable the IBM FlashCopy® feature in advance. It clones the disks from a golden image to new disks that are used by the new Linux guest. The process can be automated by using the cloning scripts that are supplied with this book.</p><p>It is recommended that you start with The Virtualization Cookbook for IBM Z Volume 1: IBM z/VM 7.2, SG24-8147 of this series because the IBM® z/VM hypervisor is the foundation (or base \"layer\") for installing Linux on IBM Z.</p></span>",

It has been designed to run more transactions faster and with more security and reliability specifically for the open community. It fully embraces open source-based technology. </p><p>Two servers are available for LinuxONE: The IBM® LinuxONE III LT1 and IBM LinuxONE III LT2. We describe these servers in \"IBM LinuxONE servers\" on page 5.</p><p>Aside from still running SUSE Linux Enterprise Server and Red Hat Enterprise Linux Servers, LinuxONE runs Ubuntu, which is popular on x86 hardware. </p><p>Ubuntu, which runs the cloud, smartphones, a computer that can remote control a planetary rover for NASA, many market-leading companies, and the Internet of Things, is now available on IBM LinuxONE servers. Together, these two technology communities deliver the perfect environment for cloud and DevOps. Ubuntu 16.04 on LinuxONE offers developers, enterprises, and Cloud Service Providers a scalable and secure platform for next generation applications that include OpenStack, KVM, Docker, and JuJu.</p><p>The following are reasons why you would want to optimize your servers through virtualization using LinuxONE:<br/></p><ul><li>Too many distributed physical servers with low utilization<br/></li><li>A lengthy provisioning process that delays the implementation of new applications<br/></li><li>Limitations in data center power and floor space <br/></li><li>High total cost of ownership (TCO) <br/></li><li>Difficulty allocating processing power for a dynamic environment<br/></li></ul><p>This IBM Redbooks® publication provides a technical planning reference for IT organizations that are considering a migration from their x86 distributed servers to LinuxONE. This book walks you through some of the important considerations and planning issues that you might encounter during a migration project. Within the context of a pre-existing UNIX based or x86 environment, it presents an end-to-end view of the technical challenges and methods necessary to complete a successful migration to LinuxONE.</p></span>",

Usually the books leave out some important topic,\nwhile others go too deep in some areas and must skim lightly over\nthe others. <em>A Practical Guide to Red Hat® Linux®</em>\nis one of those rare books that actually pulls it off. Mark G.\nSobell has created a single reference for Red Hat Linux that cannot\nbe beat! This marvelous text (with a 4-CD set of Linux Fedora Core\n2 included) is well worth the price. This is as close to an\n‘everything you ever needed to know’ book that\nI’ve seen. It’s just that good and rates 5 out of\n5.”<br/>\n<em>—Ray Lodato, Slashdot contributor</em>\n</p><p>\n“Mark Sobell has written a book as approachable as it is\nauthoritative.”<br/>\n<em>—Jeffrey Bianchine, Advocate, Author, Journalist</em>\n</p><p>\n“Excellent reference book, well suited for the sysadmin of\na linux cluster, or the owner of a PC contemplating installing a\nrecent stable linux. Don’t be put off by the daunting heft of\nthe book. Sobell has striven to be as inclusive as possible, in\ntrying to anticipate your system administration needs.”<br/>\n<em>—Wes Boudville, Inventor</em>\n</p><p>\n“<em>A Practical Guide to Red Hat® Linux®</em> is\na brilliant book. Thank you Mark Sobell.”<br/>\n<em>—C. Pozrikidis, University of California at San\nDiego</em>\n</p><p>\n“This book presents the best overview of the Linux\noperating system that I have found. . . . It should be very helpful\nand understandable no matter what the reader’s background is:\ntraditional UNIX user, new Linux devotee, or even Windows user.\nEach topic is presented in a clear, complete fashion and very few\nassumptions are made about what the reader knows. . . . The book is\nextremely useful as a reference, as it contains a 70-page glossary\nof terms and is very well indexed. It is organized in such a way\nthat the reader can focus on simple tasks without having to wade\nthrough more advanced topics until they are ready.”<br/>\n<em>—Cam Marshall, Marshall Information Service LLC, Member of\nFront Range UNIX Users Group FRUUG, Boulder, Colorado</em>\n</p><p>\n“Conclusively, this is THE book to get if you are a new\nLinux user and you just got into RH/Fedora world. There’s no\nother book that discusses so many different topics and in such\ndepth.”<br/>\n<em>—Eugenia Loli-Queru, Editor in Chief, OSNews.com</em>\n</p><p><b>The Most Useful Linux Tutorial and Reference Ever, with\nHundreds of High-Quality Examples Covering Every Linux\nDistribution!</b></p><p>To be truly productive with Linux, you need to thoroughly master\nthe shells and the command line. Until now, you had to buy two\nbooks to gain that mastery: a tutorial on fundamental Linux\nconcepts and techniques, plus a separate reference.

Linux is often treated as a highly secure operating system. However, the reality is that Linux has its share of security ?aws, and these security ?aws allow attackers to get into your system and modify or even destroy your important data. But there's no need to panic, since there are various mechanisms by which these ?aws can be removed, and this book will help you learn about different types of Linux security to create a more secure Linux system. \n</p><p>With a step-by-step recipe approach, the book starts by introducing you to various threats to Linux systems. Then, this book will walk you through customizing the Linux kernel and securing local files. Next, you will move on to managing user authentication both locally and remotely and mitigating network attacks. Later, you will learn about application security and kernel vulnerabilities. You will also learn about patching Bash vulnerability, packet filtering, handling incidents, and monitoring system logs. Finally, you will learn about auditing using system services and performing vulnerability scanning on Linux.\n</p><p>By the end of this book, you will be able to secure your Linux systems and create a robust environment.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Learn about vulnerabilities and exploits in relation to Linux systems\n</li><li>Configure and build a secure kernel and test it\n</li><li>Learn about file permissions and how to securely modify files\n</li><li>Authenticate users remotely and securely copy files on remote systems\n</li><li>Review different network security methods and tools\n</li><li>Perform vulnerability scanning on Linux machines using tools\n</li><li>Learn about malware scanning and read through logs</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book is intended for all those Linux users who already have knowledge of Linux file systems and administration.

The first set of recipes work around file labeling as one of the most common and important SELinux administrative aspects. Then, we move on to custom policy development, showing how this is done for web application confinement, desktop application protection, and custom server policies. Next, we shift our focus to the end user, restricting user privileges and setting up role-based access controls. After that, we redirect our focus to the integration of SELinux with Linux systems, aligning SELinux with existing security controls on a Linux system. Finally, we will learn how applications interact with the SELinux subsystem internally; ensuring that whatever the challenge, we will be able to find the best solution.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Manage resource labels and fine-tune your policies to automatically handle labeling</li><li>Gain an insight into how to tune the web server SELinux policy for secure web application hosting</li><li>Learn how to confine desktop applications through custom-built policies</li><li>Protect a server's assets by creating your own service-specific SELinux policies</li><li>Discover how to restrict users without hindering them by installing role-based access control</li><li>Troubleshoot and debug the behavior of SELinux-enabled applications</li></ul></span>",

Can you push it to operate at the level of a $2,000 computer? This book is here to help you find out.<div><br/></div><div>The primary focus of this book is getting as much as possible done with a simple Pi through non-graphic, non-mouse means. This means the keyboard and the text-mode screen. On the desktop side, you'll look at many of the most powerful GUI apps available, as these offer an easy entry to get started as you learn the command line.<br/><div><br/></div><div>You'll begin by setting up and configuring a Raspberry Pi with the option to run it as a graphical desktop environment or even more economically boot straight to the command line. If you want more performance, more efficiency, and (arguably) less complexity from your Pi that can only be found through the keyboard and command line. </div><div><br/></div><div>You'll also set up and configure a Raspberry Pi to use command line tools from within either the Raspberry Pi terminal, or by logging in remotely through some other computer. Once in, you'll look at Package Managers, Tmux, Ranger, and Midnight Commander as general-purpose power tools. The book then gets into specific task-oriented tools for reading email, spreadsheet work, notes, security, web browsing and design, social media, task and video password management, coding, and much more.

    "description": "<span><p><b>Implement Industrial-Strength Security on Any Linux Server</b></p><p>In an age of mass surveillance, when advanced cyberwarfare weapons rapidly migrate into every hacker's toolkit, you can't rely on outdated security methods-especially if you're responsible for Internet-facing services. In <i><b>Linux® Hardening in Hostile Networks,</b></i> Kyle Rankin helps you to implement modern safeguards that provide maximum impact with minimum effort and to strip away old techniques that are no longer worth your time.</p><p>Rankin provides clear, concise guidance on modern workstation, server, and network hardening, and explains how to harden specific services, such as web servers, email, DNS, and databases. Along the way, he demystifies technologies once viewed as too complex or mysterious but now essential to mainstream Linux security. He also includes a full chapter on effective incident response that both DevOps and SecOps can use to write their own incident response plan.</p><p>Each chapter begins with techniques any sysadmin can use quickly to protect against entry-level hackers and presents intermediate and advanced techniques to safeguard against sophisticated and knowledgeable attackers, perhaps even state actors. Throughout, you learn what each technique does, how it works, what it does and doesn't protect against, and whether it would be useful in your environment.</p><ul><li><p>Apply core security techniques including 2FA and strong passwords</p></li><li><p>Protect admin workstations via lock screens, disk encryption, BIOS passwords, and other methods</p></li><li><p>Use the security-focused Tails distribution as a quick path to a hardened workstation</p></li><li><p>Compartmentalize workstation tasks into VMs with varying levels of trust</p></li><li><p>Harden servers with SSH, use apparmor and sudo to limit the damage attackers can do, and set up remote syslog servers to track their actions</p></li><li><p>Establish secure VPNs with OpenVPN, and leverage SSH to tunnel traffic when VPNs can't be used</p></li><li><p>Configure a software load balancer to terminate SSL/TLS connections and initiate new ones downstream</p></li><li><p>Set up standalone Tor services and hidden Tor services and relays</p></li><li><p>Secure Apache and Nginx web servers, and take full advantage of HTTPS</p></li><li><p>Perform advanced web server hardening with HTTPS forward secrecy and ModSecurity web application firewalls</p></li><li><p>Strengthen email security with SMTP relay authentication, SMTPS, SPF records, DKIM, and DMARC</p></li><li><p>Harden DNS servers, deter their use in DDoS attacks, and fully implement DNSSEC</p></li><li><p>Systematically protect databases via network access control, TLS traffic encryption, and encrypted data storage</p></li><li><p>Respond to a compromised server, collect evidence, and prevent future attacks</p></li></ul><p><i>Register your product at informit.com/register for convenient access to downloads, updates, and corrections as they become available.</i></p></span>",

    "title": "Linux for Makers, 1st Edition",
    "description": "<span><span><div><p>Linux is a powerful open-source operating system that has been around for many years and is widely used for running servers and websites. But most students and Makers encounter it for the first time when they are working on projects with their Raspberry Pi or similar single-board computers (SBCs) such as BeagleBone Black or Intel Galileo. Linux for Makers is the first book that explains the Linux operating system specifically for Makers, as opposed to programmers and administrators.  By gaining a deeper understanding of Linux, Makers can add another useful tool to their kit that will help them build their projects more easily.</p><p>Written with the Maker in mind, this book will focus mostly on Rasbian running on the Raspberry Pi as it is the most prolific in the ecosystem today. However most of the topics covered will apply broadly to other Linux distributions and will be called out when they may differ. Many times users cut and paste from a website tutorial into the Linux command line without understanding what they are actually doing only to be frustrated when they want to modify or tweak something to suit their needs. Also, many Makers shy away from using the Raspberry Pi or similar board because they feel Linux is too foreign and they think using a command line will be more difficult than using a GUI. This book aims to overcome those fears and provide a foundation for further learning and exploration. To that end, this book will focus on the basic principles that a Maker would need to know as opposed to other resources that go into detail that is not particularly relevant to building projects.</p></div></span></span>",

The contents of this book follow the guidelines from Linux regarding LinuxONE installations. The preferred practices that are described in this book are gathered from the experiences of those specialists in hundreds of projects at IBM and customer environments.</p><p>This IBM Redbooks® publication provides you with the information needed in making a decision on scaling architecture when implementing Linux on LinuxONE. This book has the following goals:<br/></p><ul><br/><li>To inform you about x86 sprawl problems<br/></li><li>To inform you that x86 Vertical Scale out architectures are problematic going forward<br/></li><li>To provide solutions to x86 server sprawl problems<br/></li><li>To inform you about the LinuxONE solution for each x86 server sprawl problem<br/></li><li>To provide virtulization and security options for LinuxOne <br/></li></ul><br/>The scaling up and scaling out architectures enable you to scale the capacity of an existing system to accommodate sporadic application demands or application workloads. This provides some freedom to operate in the environment. However, if this activity is performed without correct planning and the correct architecture choice, it leads to server sprawl where your environment houses more servers than it should based on its current and predicted requirements. This can potentially cause your enterprise to both waste resources and increase costs. <p>Although scaling out on x86 systems is a common form of growth because of inexpensive x86 systems, the scale out can easily become a problem in terms of total cost of ownership (TCO) when the environment starts to increase the number of physical servers and the resources needed to maintain them. </p><p>LinuxONE servers solve the sprawl problem caused by the scaling out of x86 servers, and are an excellent choice for cloud, mobile, big data, blockchain, analytics, and other workloads that require a robust and flexible environment.</p><p>This publication describes the advantages and disadvantages of the LinuxONE scaling option.</p><p>The audience for this publication consists of the following groups:<br/></p><ul><br/><li>Customers, IBM Business Partners, IT architects and IT Specialists planning and installing Linux on LinuxONE<br/></li><li>System administrators managing the Linux Systems<br/></li></ul></span>",
