    "description": "<span><span><p>What if your image could only communicate one thing: one major\nidea, overarching theme, or driving emotion? If you identified\nthis, you’d discover your vision for that image—the\ninternal, invisible guiding principle that directs both how you\ncapture the image and how you develop it in the digital\ndarkroom.<br/>\nWithout vision, you likely find yourself flailing both behind the\ncamera and in front of the computer—indiscriminately shooting\nand arbitrarily moving sliders in hopes of stumbling upon something\ngreat every once in a while. With vision, you bring direction and\nintention to both the creation and development of all your\nimages.<br/><br/><em>Vision &amp; Voice: Refining Your Vision in Adobe Photoshop\nLightroom</em> is about identifying your vision and using\nLightroom’s Develop module to give voice—that outward\nexpression—to your vision. Photographer David duChemin begins\nwith the fundamentals of a vision-driven workflow, where he\ndiscusses everything from vision and style, to the importance of\nmood and color, to the crucial role of histograms and of getting\nthe best possible digital negative to work with. After\ndemonstrating how the Develop module’s tools affect the\naesthetics of your image, duChemin then offers a straightforward\napproach to developing your images in accordance with your own\npersonal vision: identify your intention, minimize the\ndistractions, maximize the mood, and draw the viewer’s\neye—all while leaving room for play and serendipity. Finally,\nduChemin applies this approach to 20 of his photographs as he takes\nyou into his own digital darkroom and, beginning with the original\nRAW file, works step by step through the development of the final\nimage.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>ARE YOU READY FOR AN AMAZING NEW VERSION OF THE PHOTOSHOP BOOK\nTHAT BREAKS ALL THE RULES?<br/>\nScott Kelby, the best-selling Photoshop author in the world today,\nonce again takes this book to a whole new level as he uncovers the\nlatest, most important, and most exciting new Adobe Photoshop CS4\ntechniques for digital photographers. This major update to his\naward-winning, record-breaking book does something for digital\nphotographers that’s never been done before—it cuts\nthrough the bull and shows you exactly “how to do it.”\nIt’s not a bunch of theory; it doesn’t challenge you to\ncome up with your own settings or figure it out on your own.\nInstead, Scott shows you step-by-step the exact techniques used by\ntoday’s cutting-edge digital photographers, and best of all,\nhe shows you flat-out exactly which settings to use, when to use\nthem, and why. That’s why the previous editions of this book\nare widely used as the official study guide in photography courses\nat colleges and universities around the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nLEARN HOW THE PROS DO IT<br/>\nEach year Scott trains thousands of professional photographers how\nto use Photoshop, and almost without exception they have the same\nquestions, the same problems, and the same challenges—and\nthat’s exactly what he covers in this book. You’ll\nlearn:<br/>\n<br/>\n• The sharpening techniques the pros really use.<br/>\n• The pros’ tricks for fixing the most common digital\nphoto problems fast!<br/>\n• The step-by-step setup for getting what comes out of your\nprinter to match exactly what you see onscreen.<br/>\n• A whole chapter on how to process HDR (High Dynamic Range)\nimages.<br/>\n• How to master new CS4 interface and workflow\nfeatures.<br/>\n• How to color correct any photo without breaking a\nsweat.<br/>\n• How to process RAW digital camera images (plus how to take\nadvantage of all the new Camera Raw features in CS4!).<br/>\n• How to add real automation to your work.<br/>\n• How to show your work like a pro!<br/>\n• A host of shortcuts, workarounds, and slick\n“insider” tricks to send your productivity through the\nroof!<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus, Scott included a special bonus chapter with his own CS4\nworkflow, from start to finish. If you’re a digital\nphotographer, and you’re ready to learn the “tricks of\nthe trade”—the same ones that today’s leading\npros use to correct, edit, sharpen, retouch, and present their\nwork—then you’re holding the book that will do just\nthat.<br/></p></span>",

Instead, by using the following three\nsimple, yet brilliant, techniques that make it just an incredible\nlearning tool, this book shows you how to create your own\nphotography workflow using Lightroom:<br/>\n<br/></p><li><p>Throughout the book, Scott shares his own personal settings and\nstudiotested techniques. Each year he trains thousands of Lightroom\nusers at his live seminars and through that he’s learned what\nreally works, what doesn’t, and he tells you flat out which\ntechniques work best, which to avoid, and why.</p></li><li><p>The entire book is laid out in a real workflow order with\neverything step by step, so you can begin using Lightroom like a\npro from the start.</p></li><li><p>What really sets this book apart is the last chapter. This is\nwhere Scott dramatically answers his #1 most-asked Lightroom\nquestion, which is: “Exactly what order am I supposed to do\nthings in, and where does Photoshop fit in?” You’ll see\nScott’s entire start-to-finish Lightroom 5 workflow and learn\nhow to incorporate it into your own workflow.</p></li><li><p>Plus, this book includes a downloadable collection of some of\nthe hottest Lightroom Develop module presets to give you a bunch of\namazing effects with just one click!</p></li><p>Scott knows first-hand the challenges today’s digital\nphotographers are facing, and what they want to learn next to make\ntheir workflow faster, easier, and more fun. He has incorporated\nall of that into this major update for Lightroom 5.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt’s the first and only book to bring the whole process\ntogether in such a clear, concise, and visual way. Plus, the book\nincludes a special chapter on integrating Adobe Photoshop\nseamlessly right into your workflow, and you’ll also learn\nsome of Scott’s latest Photoshop portrait retouching\ntechniques and special effects, which take this book to a whole new\nlevel. There is no faster, more straight-to-the-point, or more fun\nway to learn Lightroom than with this groundbreaking\nbook. </p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Just about every digital image requires sharpening since\nsoftness is inevitably introduced during the image digitizing\nprocess, and oftentimes with digital photography, images are\nsharpened badly. This second edition of the definitive book by the\nlate Bruce Fraser teaches readers all they need to know about\nsharpening, including when to use it, why it's needed, how to use\nthe camera's features, how to recognize an image that needs\nsharpening, how much to use, what's bad sharpening, and how to fix\noversharpening.<br/>\n<em><br/>\nReal World Image Sharpening with Adobe Photoshop, Camera Raw, and\nLightroom, Second Edition</em> is written by Fraser's friend and\nrenowned photographer Jeff Schewe. It adds essential coverage of\nAdobe Photoshop Lightroom and Adobe Camera Raw, since many of the\nkey sharpening functions have migrated from Photoshop to those\ntools since the first edition of the book was published.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe book shows readers how to: recognize the kind of sharpening\nthat each image needs; become acquainted with the full arsenal of\nsharpening tools built into Photoshop, Lightroom, and Camera Raw;\nsharpen part of an image selectively; create a complete sharpening\nworkflow that allows sharpening images optimally for different\nuses; balance the contradictory demands of sharpening and noise\nreduction; and more.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><em>Film and Video Editing Theory</em> offers an accessible, introductory guide to the practices used to create meaning through editing. In this book, Michael Frierson synthesizes the theories of the most prominent film editors and scholars, from Herbert Zettl, Sergei Eisenstein, and Noël Burch to the work of landmark Hollywood editors like Walter Murch and Edward Dmytryk. In so doing, he maps out a set of craft principles for readers, whether one is debating if a flashback reveals too much, if a certain cut clarifies or obscures the space of a scene, or if a shot needs to be trimmed. The book is grounded in the unity of theory and practice, looking beyond technical proficiency in a specific software to explain to readers how and why certain cuts work or don’t work. </p></span>",

Styles have the power to transform how design and\nproduction professionals approach and accomplish any project.\nAdopting a style-centric workflow can reduce tasks that would\nnormally take days to mere hours, and tasks that would take hours\nto minutes or even seconds. Less time spent on repetitive tasks\nmeans more time for creating your best work.<br/><br/>\nThis book explores every InDesign style to reveal its full\npotential.

    "description": "<span><p><b>AN AMAZING NEW VERSION OF THE PHOTOSHOP BOOK THAT BREAKS ALL THE RULES!</b></p><p>Scott Kelby, Editor and Publisher of <i>Photoshop User</i> magazine–and the best-selling photography techniques author in the world today–once again takes this book to a whole new level as he uncovers more of the latest, most important, and most useful Adobe Photoshop techniques for photographers.</p><p>This update to his award-winning, record-breaking book does something for digital photographers that’s never been done before–it cuts through the bull and shows you exactly “how to do it.” It’s not a bunch of theory; it doesn’t challenge you to come up with your own settings or figure it out on your own. Instead, Scott shows you step by step the exact techniques used by today’s cutting-edge digital photographers, and best of all, he shows you flat-out exactly which settings to use, when to use them, and why. </p><p><b>LEARN HOW THE PROS DO IT</b></p><p>The photographer’s workflow in Photoshop has evolved greatly over time, and in this current version of book you’ll wind up doing a <i>lot</i> of your processing and editing in Photoshop’s Adobe Camera Raw feature (whether you shoot in RAW, JPEG or TIFF–it works for all three). That’s because for years now, Adobe has been adding most of Photoshop’s new features for photography directly into Camera Raw itself. Since today’s photography workflow in Photoshop is based around Camera Raw, about one third of this book is about mastering Camera Raw like a pro. Plus, you’ll learn:</p><p>• The sharpening techniques the pros really use.</p><p>• The pros’ tricks for fixing the most common digital photo problems fast!</p><p>• The most useful retouching techniques for photographers, and how to make “impossible” selections like wind-blown hair (it’s easy, once you know the secrets), and how to use Layers like a pro.  </p><p>• How to seamlessly remove distracting junk from your images.</p><p>• How to stitch panoramas, how to process HDR for a realistic look, and tricks for pulling way more out of your images than you ever dreamed possible.</p><p>• The latest Photoshop special effects for photographers (there’s a whole chapter just on these!).</p><p>• A host of shortcuts, workarounds, and slick “insider” tricks to send your productivity through the roof!</p><p>Scott includes a special chapter with his own workflow, from start to finish, plus, each chapter ends with a Photoshop Killer Tips section, packed with time-saving, job-saving tips that make all the difference. He also provides four bonus chapters, along with the images used in the book for download so you can follow right along. If you’re ready to learn all the “tricks of the trade”–the same ones that today’s leading pros use to correct, edit, retouch, and sharpen their work–then you’re holding the book that will do just that.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>Adobe Photoshop Lightroom is fast becoming the digital\nphotographer’s tool of choice, with its killer combination of\nversatile photo cataloging features and powerful image editing\ntools. Adobe Photoshop, its older relative, is still around,\nthough, and is still indispensable for the unique tools it offers,\nas well as its wide range of uses. This book shows photographers\nhow to use these two great products together to achieve results\nthey could not have produced working with one alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, the book provides a quick overview of the cataloging\nfunctions of Lightroom -- useful for Photoshop users who may have\nused a different photo organization tool (or none at all!). Then\nyou’ll work through a series of projects that focus on taking\nimages from Lightroom into Photoshop to use tools not available in\nLightroom. Typical workflows include stitching images into a\npanorama, layering multiple exposures of a scene to create a high\ndynamic range (HDR) image, fixing common photo problems (like blur\ncaused by camera shake), bringing out important details or adding\ncreative effects with adjustment layers, or layering images to\ncreate composites (including adding text or 3D objects), or doing\nprecise photo retouching.<br/>\n<br/>\nClassroom in a Book®, the best-selling series of hands-on\nsoftware training workbooks, helps you learn the features of Adobe\nsoftware quickly and easily.

Later chapters cover long-document features, such as tables of contents and indexes.

    "description": "<span><p>From Adobe InDesign CS2 to InDesign CS5, the ability to work with XML content has been built into every version of InDesign. Some of the useful applications are importing database content into InDesign to create catalog pages, exporting XML that will be useful for subsequent publishing processes, and building chunks of content that can be reused in multiple publications.<br/><br/>In this Short Cut, we’ll play with the contents of a college course catalog and see how we can use XML for course descriptions, tables, and other content. Underlying principles of XML structure, DTDs, and the InDesign namespace will help you develop your own XML processes. We’ll touch briefly on using InDesign to “skin” XML content, exporting as XHTML, InCopy, and the IDML package. The Advanced Topics section gives tips on using XSLT to manipulate XML in conjunction with InDesign.</p></span>",

These principles are often excluded from books that teach software. <i>Foundations of Digital Art and Design</i> reinvigorates software training by integrating design exercises into tutorials that fuse design fundamentals and core Adobe Creative Cloud skills. </p><p> </p><p>The result is a comprehensive design learning experience organized into five sections that focus on vector art, photography, image manipulation, typography, and effective work habits for digital artists. Design topics and principles include: Bits, Dots, Lines, Shapes, Unity, Rule of Thirds, Zone System, Color Models, Collage, Appropriation, Gestalt, The Bauhaus Basic Course Approach, Continuity, Automation, and Revision. </p><p> </p><p>This book:</p><p> </p><ul><li>Teaches art and design principles with references to contemporary digital art alongside digital tools and processes in Adobe Creative Cloud</li><li>Addresses the growing trend of compressing design fundamentals and design software into the same course in universities and design colleges</li><li>Times each lesson to be used in 50 to 90-minute class sessions with additional practice materials available online</li><li>Includes free video screencasts that demonstrate key concepts in every chapter</li></ul><p> </p><p>Download work files and bonus chapters, view screencasts, connect with the author online and more; see the Introduction to the book for details.</p><p> </p><p>\"This ambitious book teaches visual thinking and software skills together.

    "title": "Adobe® Photoshop® Lightroom® 3: Streamlining Your Digital Photography Process",
    "description": "<span><span><span><span><p>\"I've worked my entire adult life in digital imaging, from managing high-volume production departments to running my own photography and printing businesses. And for many years, I've been teaching photographers how to be self-sufficient when it comes to working with their digital images.</p><p>Having used all major image editing software released over the past twenty years, I now choose to use Lightroom because it allows me to work quickly, helps me deal with large numbers of images and lets me get back to enjoying the creative aspects of photography.</p><p>From my experience, I know how hard it can be to learn new ways of doing things–especially computer stuff. Unfortunately for a lot of photographers, struggling with digital processing can take the fun out of photography. Trying to figure out the intricacies of file formats, resolution, color management, etc., and even simply where to put all the files can be daunting tasks. Worse yet, sometimes it's hard just to know the right steps to get the best quality from a single photo!</p><p>It's my mission to ease your pain; to show you that you really can be in control of your entire imaging process, and help you develop a personalized workflow that fits your style and needs. My students frequently tell me how liberating this is: to comfortably handle all the files coming off the camera and residing on hard disks, to work methodically through a known sequence of steps and to produce finished pictures that you're proud to show other people. This is at the heart of the photographer's experience, and I want you to know this sense of confidence and capability.</p><p>I've taught large groups and individual photographers alike. Over the years I've learned where people get stuck. I understand the pitfalls new users face when first starting to use Lightroom as well as the concerns of more experienced users looking for ways to tweak their workflow for better performance. I want to help you overcome these challenges.</p><p>My goal for this book is to teach you to effectively use Lightroom 3 as quickly and easily as possible. My writing has been heavily influenced by my experiences working with clients and students, and I've approached the content of this book as I would tutor someone in a one-on-one training session. The order in which concepts are presented and the emphasis I give to certain aspects of the workflow are unique among books of its kind.</p><p>We'll start by reviewing some important, basic principles, such as working with Lightroom catalogs, the Lightroom workflow, color management, and an introduction to Lightroom 3's updated tools and screen interface. From there, we jump right in to importing images into Lightroom. This is followed by a step-by-step editing tutorial that will make your work much easier. Then we move on to in-depth explanations of how to perfect each photo for tone, color, contrast, sharpness and much more. After a detailed look at exporting images out of Lightroom, the next three chapters deal with presenting your work to others with prints, Web sites and slideshows. Finally, we'll wrap up with an in-depth look at advanced techniques for integrating Lightroom with other software.</p><p>The material presented in this book is appropriate for digital photographers working in all disciplines, at all skill levels. The information and tutorials are applicable to every kind of photography: from weddings and portraits to fine art landscape work, everyone can learn to streamline their digital photography process using Lightroom 3.\"</p><p>Nat Coalson</p><p>Conifer, CO</p><p>2010</p></span></span></span></span>",

It’s all around you.</strong></p><p><em>Adobe InDesign CC: A Complete Course and Compendium of Features</em> is your guide to building publications great or small in this ubiquitous page layout application. First, with a complete Course that includes a set of projects and lessons derived from the curriculum of award-winning and Adobe Certified Instructor Steve Laskevitch, you will learn the procedures needed to use InDesign professionally. Dozens of lessons are included that can be applied to any document you have in mind: engineering proposals, marketing collateral, spec sheets, magazines, newsletters, books, and more. Through these step-by-step lessons, you’ll be exposed to all of InDesign’s features in practical contexts and its best practices for publishing workflows.</p><p>To complete the Course, we’ll supply lesson documents and their assets to download. These can even serve as starting points for your own projects.</p><p>Then, for greater depth of knowledge and subsequent reference, you'll use the Compendium to uncover more of the “how” and “why” of InDesign and publishing tech in general. With each topic easy to access, you can find and explore all of InDesign’s key features and concepts in depth. With cross references between the Course and Compendium, the two parts of the book complement each other perfectly. Best of all, when the lessons in the Course are done, the Compendium will continue to serve for months and years to come.</p><p>Learn step by step how to:</p><ul>• Create documents from postcards and posters to large books</ul><ul>• Take control of typography and more with styles</ul><ul>• Combine images with text for compelling layouts</ul><ul>• Use color with predictable results</ul><ul>• Prepare documents for both print and electronic output</ul><ul>• And much more!</ul><p><em>“I've known Steve for over 20 years, and have always admired his empathy and passion for generously sharing his knowledge with others. He leverages his deep understanding of InDesign and takes the time to share what he hears from users to advocate on their behalf directly to the InDesign team to make the product better. This book will definitely help you become a more efficient InDesign user.”</em></p><p>— <strong>Michael Ninness</strong><br/>Formerly InDesign Product Manager<br/>Now Adobe’s Senior Director</p><p><em>“Steve’s long relationship with Adobe InDesign and the people who actually built it make him the ideal person to guide any designer through the rich toolset that is Adobe InDesign. While his smouldering good looks and James Bond-like sophistication will not be of any value to the reader, his in-depth knowledge, years of delivering training, patience and good humour almost certainly will.”</em></p><p>— <strong>Chris Kitchener</strong><br/>Ex Group Product Manager for Adobe InDesign and Adobe Illustrator</p></span>",

And in <i>Adobe Master Class: Advanced Compositing in Adobe Photoshop CC, Second Edition</i>, Bret shares the techniques he uses to elevate an image from the everyday to the extraordinary, showing you how to make seemingly impossible scenarios come to life.</p><p> </p><p>Designed as a comprehensive guide to compositing from start to finish, this book is divided into three sections. Section I provides an overview of Adobe Photoshop CC focusing on both basic and hidden tools and other features you need to master in order to create stunning composite imagery. Bret also shows you how to shoot high-quality photos for compositing, including tips for equipment and technique. Going beyond the mechanics of Photoshop, Section II leaps into hands-on action by guiding readers through the creation of four unique composites. These fun and informative step-by-step projects cover everything from the first planning sketches to the final finishing touches (using resources provided for download). In Section III, additional detailed project walkthroughs offer tips on everything from creating a superhuman to compositing an epic fantasy landscape. Interviews and spreads featuring established and emerging artists provide a range of inspirational imagery, creative insight, and professional know-how.</p></span>",

    "title": "Creating Animations in Adobe InDesign One Step at a Time",
    "description": "<span><span><p>This is the Rough Cut version of the printed book.</p><p>Designers or other creative professionals who create digital\ndocuments are always looking for ways to make their products more\nappealing to the user. One way of doing that is to increase reader\nengagement by building interactive animated effects into their\ndesigns. Creating Animations in Adobe InDesign One Step at a Time\nteaches the reader not only how to add animation to their InDesign\ndocuments (via step-by-step exercises) but also helps the reader to\nchoose among the various digital format options for export–\nePub (concentrating on the new Fixed-Layout variety), DPS , and\nPDF. Clear explanations and plenty of full-color graphics will\nguide the reader through the potentially confusing digital\npublishing landscape.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdding animated effects in InDesign documents is a field set to\ngrow. The practice was given a big push in the 2014 release of the\nAdobe Creative Cloud, when InDesign introduced the new Fixed-Layout\nEPUB export format. EPUBS exported in this format preserve the\nlayout of the InDesign document, and can include animated effects\nas well as media, such as audio and video.<br/>\n<br/>\nFixed-Layout EPUB has gathered a large following in a short time\nfor a number of reasons. They allow ePubs such as children’s\nbooks to display fun animations to enhance the child’s\nreading experience. They provide businesses a way to create all the\ninteractivity of PDF documents PLUS animations not supported by\nPDFs. They are a viable replacement for Single Edition DPS folios\nwhich Adobe longer supports.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe book will cover over two hundred different effects you can\ncreate using the animation features of InDesign. These include\nanimations that don’t appear in the regular animation\ncontrols. Each chapter will have four or more exercises that the\nreader can follow along. The chapter exercises will start very\nbasic and then work up. So the last exercise in each chapter will\ntake more time than the first. This means someone can go through\nthe book doing only the easy exercises in each chapter and come\nback later to get more involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the exercises will use basic shapes. Other exercises will\nuse more advanced artwork. All the artwork, including the basic\nshapes, will be available for download by the reader so they can\nfollow along with the exercises. In addition, the finished artwork\nfor each exercise will also be provided to allow the readers to see\nhow the animation is supposed to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nWritten a longtime publishing expert, the book thoroughly covers\nthe theory and best practices for creating animations in InDesign\nCC.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/></p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><b>Learn Scott Kelby’s 7-Point System for developing photos to perfection in Adobe Lightroom!</b></p><p>Imagine how awesome it would be if you opened up an image in Lightroom, even a really messed up one, and you knew exactly what to do first, what to do next, and every step along the way to take that image from flat to fabulous. Well, that is precisely what this book is all about. You’re learning a system—the same one taught in colleges and universities around the world—that was crafted by world-renowned Lightroom expert Scott Kelby, the world’s #1 best-selling Lightroom book author.</p><p>This is a new way of working and thinking about editing your images that will change the way you work in Lightroom forever, so you’ll spend less time fixing your photos and more time finishing them, and doing the fun, creative things that make Lightroom the amazing tool that it is.</p><p>Scott narrowed things down to just the seven major editing moves we need to master to enhance our images like a pro, so we’re not learning Lightroom tools we’re probably never going to need. Then, and perhaps most importantly, he determined exactly when and in which order to apply these seven techniques that make up this proven, time-tested “Lightroom 7-Point System.”</p><p>But, the magic of this book isn’t just listing the seven techniques and how they work. It’s how they’re used together, and it’s the learning process you go through that makes this book so unique. This isn’t a “read about it” book. This is a hands-on “you do it” book. You start each lesson with the RAW photo, right out of the camera (you can download Scott’s images, so you can follow right along). Then, you’re going to apply the 7-Point System in a very specific way, and you’re going to do it over and over again, and again, and again, on a range of various photos, with different challenges and situations, until these seven points are absolutely second nature to you. You’re going to do the full edit each time—from beginning to end—with nothing left out. Once you learn this system, there won’t be an image on your screen that you won’t be able to enhance, fix, edit, and finish like a pro!</p><p>As you move through the book, you’ll be amazed at how well this system works across such a wide range of photos, from landscapes to portraits, from architectural to sports photography, from wedding photos to everything in between. The book is 21 short lessons (including two bonus lessons where you work with Lightroom and Photoshop together), and if you spend just 10 minutes a day doing that day’s lesson, in three weeks, there won’t be a photo you won’t be able to beat! You’ll know what to do first, what to do next, and in exactly which order to take a dull, lifeless image and make it one you’d proudly hang on your wall. Best of all, you’ll learn more than just the 7-Point System along the way, as you’ll have to tackle whatever each image throws at you, so you’re going to discover extra techniques, shortcuts, and workarounds that will help you in every aspect of your editing.</p><p>This is the book you’ve been waiting for—the industry has been waiting for—and once you learn this system and start applying it yourself, you’ll be the next one to say, “You can’t beat the system!”</p></span>",

There will be a lot of times when you need to get something done in Lightroom Classic, but you have no idea where Adobe hid that feature, or what the “secret handshake” is to do that thing you need now so you can get back to working on your images. That’s why this book was created: to get you to the technique, the shortcut, or exactly the right setting, right now.</p><p><em>How Do I Do That In Lightroom Classic? (2nd Edition)</em> is a fully updated version of the bestselling first edition, and here’s how it works: When you need to know how to do a particular thing, you turn to the chapter where it would be found (Print, Slideshow, Organizing, Importing, Mobile, etc.), find the thing you need to do (it’s easy, each page covers just one single topic), and Scott tells you exactly how to do it just like he was sitting there beside you, using the same casual style as if he were telling a friend. That way, you get back to editing your images fast.</p><p>This isn’t a book of theory, full of confusing jargon and detailed multi-step concepts. This is a book on which button to click, which setting to use, and exactly how and when to use it, so you’re never “stuck” in Lightroom Classic again. This will be your “go to” book that sits within reach any time you’re working in Lightroom, and you are going to love having this type of help right at your fingertips.</p></span>",

Does what I am doing enhance the picture,\nor is it just artifice for artifice’s sake?”\nIn <em>Lightroom Transformations</em>, Martin applies this\napproach to a broad collection of images, showing you how to turn\nordinary-looking photos into hero shots—without using fancy\nmontage techniques or wacky effects. By giving each image his\nown interpretation and explaining the rationale behind the\nchoices he makes, he shows how you can do the same when processing\nyour photos.</p><p>Focusing primarily on techniques using\nLightroom and Camera Raw—but also with Photoshop—Martin\ndemonstrates how to manipulate the tones and composition of images\nto create photographs that correspond to your personal photographic\nvision. Filled with before-and-after shots with detailed\nexplanations of how to go from an ordinary image to an\nextraordinary one, the book illustrates what you can achieve using\nLightroom or Photoshop as a creative tool to enhance the natural\nbeauty that lies within your images.</p><li><p>Helps you pre-visualize the end result you would like for your\nphotos, and provides easy-to-follow steps for simple edits to\npolish almost any image</p></li><li><p>Includes tips on shooting technique to improve your images\nin-camera</p></li><li><p>Demonstrates how to recompose existing shots to illustrate how\na photograph could have been shot and composed better</p></li><li><p>Includes short videos that demonstrate some of the techniques\ndiscussed in the book</p></li></span></span>",

The book\ndeftly combines practical information about working with the camera\nand computer, but under Julieanne's guidance the practical is\nalways presented in the service of maintaining and supporting the\nphotographer's vision for the overall project.</p><p>There are other books on using Lightroom to\ncatalog and edit images, but they tend to be general-purpose\nmanuals that cover any and all types of images and uses.

    "title": "How Do I Do That In InDesign?",
    "description": "<span><p><strong>Have you ever felt overwhelmed by InDesign? You just want to find what you need so you can move forward with your work. You're not alone. <em>How Do I Do That Thing in InDesign?</em> is here to answer your questions quickly and clearly.  </strong></p><p>Adobe InDesign is the clear software of choice for designers in desktop publishing and typesetting. With it, designers create professional, eye-catching posters, flyers, brochures, magazines, newspapers, presentations, books, and ebooks. But because it has so much power and depth, sometimes the things you need are…well…kinda hidden or not really obvious.</p><p>There will be a lot of times when you need to get something done in InDesign, but you have no idea where Adobe hid that feature, or what the “secret handshake” is to do that thing you need now so you can get back to working. That’s why this book was created: to get you to the technique, the shortcut, or exactly the right setting, right now.</p><p>Here's how it works: When you need to know how to do a particular thing, you turn to the chapter where it would be found, find the thing you need to do (it’s easy—each page covers just one single topic), and designer and author Dave Clayton tells you exactly how to do it just like he was sitting there beside you, using the same casual style as if he were telling a friend. That way, you get back to working in InDesign fast.</p><p>This isn’t a book of theory, full of confusing jargon and detailed multi-step concepts. This is a book on which button to click, which setting to use, and exactly how and when to use it, so you’re never “stuck” in InDesign again. This will be your “go to” book that sits within reach any time you’re working in InDesign, and you are going to love having this type of help right at your fingertips.</p></span>",

Breath-taking photographer Corey Hilz wastes no time on the plethora of feature in Photoshop which, though impressive, are of no use to the 'natural' photographer. Corey instead takes you through a highly effective, professional workflow for bringing out the best in your photographs in Photoshop, from post-capture through to output, without spending hours in front of the screen. Ignoring high-end photomanipulation, he instead focusses on the vital aspects for photographers such as: correcting exposure, tone adjustments (including correct use of the tone curve), sharpening, monochrome conversion and lens correction. Additionally, Corey covers the workflow on either side: effective importing and tagging, and perfect output with minimal effort.<br id=\"CRLF\"/><br id=\"CRLF\"/>Everything about this beautiful little book is aimed at a visual audience. Pakced with stunning photographs to illustrate every tweak the author makes, this highly affordable and succinct reference guide focusses on the specific needs of the photographer and nothing else. There are hundreds of excellent comprehensive reference guides to photoshop out there, this is not one of those. It is, instead, a book that won't waste a second of your valuable shooting time. Buy into the <em>Behind the Lens</em> series and get right back where you belong and deserve to be: behind a lens.\n\n  </span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Adobe Photoshop Lightroom is truly an awesome program, and the primary editing tool for so many photographers today. But, at some point, you realize that there are things you need to do to your images that Lightroom just can't do. It could be anything from pro-level portrait retouching, to blending two or more images together, to incredible special effects, to removing distracting things in your image, to adding beautiful type to your images, and, well…there are just lots of incredible things you could do…if you just knew Photoshop.</p><p> </p><p>Adobe Photoshop is…well…it's Photoshop—this huge, amazing, Swiss Army knife of a program with 70+ tools, and more than a hundred filters. So, compared to Lightroom it seems really complicated, and it could be, but you've got a secret weapon: Scott Kelby. He's the same guy who wrote the world's #1 best-selling book on Lightroom, he's Editor and Publisher of <i>Photoshop User</i> magazine and <i>Lightroom Magazine</i>, and he's here to teach you just the most important, most useful parts of Photoshop—just the stuff that Lightroom can't already do. Once you learn these techniques (all covered in this short, quick, easy-to-use, plain-English guide), it opens a whole new world of productivity and creativity.</p><p> </p><p>Here's what you'll learn:</p><ul><li>Scott tells you flat-out which tools to use, which techniques work best, which ones to avoid, and why. You only really need about 20% of what Photoshop can do, and that 20% is all covered right in this book.</li></ul><p/><ul><li>The most important layer techniques, and learning layers is like being handed the keys to the candy store—this is where the fun begins, and you'll be amazed at what you'll be able to do, so quickly and easily.</li></ul><ul><li>Scott's favorite (and most useful) portrait retouching techniques; his favorite special effects for landscape, travel, and people photos; plus which filters are awesome (and which ones waste your time).</li></ul><p/><ul><li>Also, you'll learn how to mask hair and create super-realistic composites (you'll be amazed when you learn how easy this is), plus how to take advantage of all the latest Photoshop technology, how to leverage the latest features (so you're doing things the easy way), and a bunch of today's most popular techniques (the same commercial looks you're seeing in hot demand), so you'll be using Photoshop like a shark in no time.</li></ul><p> </p><p>If you've been saying to yourself, “Ya know, I really should learn Photoshop,” you're holding the absolute best book to get you there, coming from the guy who literally wrote the book on Lightroom. He knows how to help you make the most of using these two powerful tools together to take your images (and your fun) to the next level. You are going to love being a Photoshop shark!</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><strong>In <em>The Photoshop Toolbox</em>, photographer and bestselling author Glyn Dewis breaks down Photoshop into just three main features: layer masks, brushes, and blend modes. Written specifically for photographers with little knowledge of Photoshop, this book breaks down the how, what, and why of Photoshop basics. </strong></p><p>Adobe Photoshop is one of the most powerful image-editing applications ever created, but it is also widely thought to be difficult to learn, infinite in scope, and nearly impossible to master. For these reasons, many photographers choose to stay exclusively with Lightroom for all their photography needs. But for those photographers who subscribe to the Adobe Creative Cloud Photography plan—which includes both Lightroom and Photoshop—to leave Photoshop unopened and unexplored is to deny yourself the ability to take your creativity and expression to a whole new level.</p><p>In <em>The Photoshop Toolbox</em>, photographer and bestselling author Glyn Dewis breaks down Photoshop into just three main features: layer masks, brushes, and blend modes. Glyn has taught thousands online, in person, and through his bestselling books <em>The Photoshop Workbook</em> and <em>Photograph Like a Thief</em>. Over and over, he has recognized that once a user truly understands these three tools, there is nothing holding them back from achieving whatever they want to accomplish in Photoshop. With Glyn explaining not only the “what” but also the “why” behind layer masks, brushes, and blend modes, you’re empowered to think beyond each specific example and to ask that all-powerful question, “What would happen if I used that technique on this other image?”</p><p>Written expressly for photographers with little knowledge of Photoshop, in <em>The Photoshop Toolbox</em> you’ll learn:</p><ul><ul><ul>• </ul></ul></ul><p><strong>Photoshop basics: </strong></p><ul><ul>Explore Photoshop’s Workspace, Tool Bar, Options Bar, Properties, and Layers</ul></ul><ul><ul><ul>• </ul></ul></ul><p><strong>Layer masks: </strong></p><ul><ul>Learn the basics of layer masks, as well as specific techniques that incorporate cutouts, removing halos, Content Aware Fill, Look Up Tables (LUTs), and more</ul></ul><ul><ul><ul>•</ul></ul></ul><p><strong>Brushes: </strong></p><ul><ul>Brushes are useful for everything from cutouts to creating special effects like snow, debris, grass, and even your own signature</ul></ul><ul><ul><ul>• </ul></ul></ul><p><strong>Blend modes: </strong></p><ul><ul>Use blend modes for tricky selections, brightening and darkening an image, and tidying up a layer mask</ul></ul><ul><ul><ul>• </ul></ul></ul><p><strong>Additional tips, tricks, and techniques: </strong></p><ul><ul>Glyn devotes an entire chapter to “extra” techniques such as removing reddening skin, creating smoke, matching color, and building depth in your image with contrast, light, and sharpness</ul></ul><p>Finally, in the last chapter of the book, Glyn brings it all together with a start-to-finish project concentrating on photo retouching skills.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>Since Lightroom first launched, Scott Kelby’s <em>The Adobe\nPhotoshop Lightroom Book for Digital Photographers</em> has been the\nworld’s #1 best-selling Lightroom book (it has been\ntranslated into a dozen different languages), and in this latest\nversion for Lightroom 4, Scott uses his same award-winning,\nstep-by-step, plain-English style and layout to make learning\nLightroom easy and fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nScott doesn’t just show you which sliders do what (every\nLightroom book will do that). Instead, by using the following three\nsimple, yet brilliant, techniques that make it just an incredible\nlearning tool, this book shows you how to create your own\nphotography workflow using Lightroom:<br/></p><li><p>Throughout the book, Scott shares his own personal settings and\nstudio-tested techniques. Each year he trains thousands of\nLightroom users at his \"Lightroom Live!\" tour and through that\nhe’s learned what really works, what doesn’t, and he\ntells you flat out which techniques work best, which to avoid, and\nwhy.</p></li><li><p>The entire book is laid out in a real workflow order with\neverything step by step, so you can begin using Lightroom like a\npro from the start.</p></li><li><p>What really sets this book apart is the last chapter. This is\nwhere Scott dramatically answers his #1 most-asked Lightroom\nquestion, which is: \"Exactly what order am I supposed to do things\nin, and where does Photoshop fit in?\" You’ll see\nScott’s entire start-to-finish Lightroom 4 workflow and learn\nhow to incorporate it into your own workflow.</p></li><p>Scott knows first-hand the challenges today’s digital\nphotographers are facing, and what they want to learn next to make\ntheir workflow faster, easier, and more fun. He has incorporated\nall of that into this major update for Lightroom 4.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt’s the first and only book to bring the whole process\ntogether in such a clear, concise, and visual way. Plus, the book\nincludes a special chapter on integrating Adobe Photoshop\nseamlessly into your workflow, and you’ll also learn some of\nScott’s latest Photoshop portrait retouching techniques and\nspecial effects, which take this book to a whole new level. There\nis no faster, more straight-to-the-point, or more fun way to learn\nLightroom than with this groundbreaking book.</p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><strong>\"You are not offering testimony to the existence of something, you are bringing something into existence—something that did not exist before, and that would not exist if it were not for you.\" - Guy Tal </strong></p><p>The first step to creating an expressive photograph happens before you even click the shutter: it is the act of visualizing an image in your mind’s eye. Once composed and captured, the data recorded by the camera is then transformed in processing to match the visualized image.</p><p>To become a better expressive photographer means, among other things, to become a better visualizer. This requires more than just technical skill, but also an understanding of what art is, what it means to be an artist, and how to translate your thoughts, feelings, and experiences into visual creations.</p><p>In <em>The Landscape Photographer’s Guide to Photoshop: A Visualization-Driven Workflow</em>, Guy Tal provides a broad theoretical foundation for digital landscape photography as an expressive visual art, and for understanding how art and technology come together to serve your creative purpose. He then offers a roadmap for a visualization-driven approach to processing images in Photoshop.</p><p>Topics include:</p><ul><li>An overview of the history of art and of photography as art</li><li>A deeper understanding of creativity and visualization, and of the technical underpinnings of digital imaging</li><li>Techniques to effectively apply visualization in creating and processing your images</li><li>How to perform “gap analysis” to identify the gaps between the image at any point in time and the desired outcome</li><li>How to convert your RAW files using Adobe Camera Raw prior to editing in Photoshop</li><li>How best to employ many of Photoshop’s tools and features</li><li>How to leverage Layers and Masks to accomplish your visualized results</li><li>How to control and adjust contrast, color, and tone</li><li>Image blending techniques to extend dynamic range and for focus stacking</li><li>Processing strategies for black-and-white conversions, including toning your images</li><li>Printing and other output techniques including sizing, sharpening, noise reduction, and color management</li></ul><p>Bringing all of these techniques together, Guy presents a detailed case study, beginning with his initial visualization for the final image and working through his processing steps from RAW conversion to the final print.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><strong>Scott Kelby, the world’s #1 best-selling photography technique books author, is here with an entirely new concept in Photoshop books—one that’s designed from the ground up to get you straight to whatever it is you need to do in Photoshop right now, get your answer fast, and get you back to editing your images in Photoshop.</strong></p><p>Thanks to Adobe’s incredibly popular Creative Cloud Photography plan, which includes Photoshop and Lightroom, photographers are extending the depth and power of Lightroom by jumping over to Photoshop to do all those things Lightroom just can’t do (or Lightroom can do, but in Photoshop, it’s faster and easier, or the results are just better). Because Photoshop has so much power and depth, sometimes the things you need are…well…kinda hidden or not really obvious. There will be a lot of times when you need to get something done in Photoshop, and you know Photoshop can do it (because Photoshop can do just about anything), but you have no idea where Adobe hid that feature, or what the “secret handshake” is to do that thing you need now so you can get back to working on your images. That’s why this book was created: to quickly get you to the technique, the shortcut, the setting, or exactly the right thing you need to do right now.</p><p>Here’s how it works: When you need to know how to do a particular thing, you turn to the chapter where it would be found (Layers, Printing, Fixing Problems, Special Effects, etc.), find the thing you need to do (it’s easy, each page covers just one single topic), and Scott tells you exactly how to do it just like he was sitting there beside you, using the same casual style as if he were telling a friend. That way, you get back to editing your images fast.</p><p><strong>This isn’t a book of theory, full of confusing jargon and detailed multi-step concepts. This is a book on which button to click, which setting to use, and exactly how and when to use it, so you’re never “stuck” in Photoshop again. This will be your “go to” book that sits within reach any time you’re working in Photoshop. With this book, help is right at your fingertips.</strong></p></span>",

Professional graphic design firms, ad agencies, and publishing houses do not usually work with just one of these programs when creating designs. Rather, they use a collection of illustration, image-editing, and layout programs to build their designs for print or the Web. This book will show readers who have a basic familiarity with Adobe software how to integrate and manage workflow among these applications. Topics covered include: Developing Consistent Color-Managed Workflows, Moving Files Among the CRVE SUTE Applications, Preparing Files for Print or the Web, Repurposing Documents, Using CRVE SUTE with Microsoft Office documents, and much more. This book will address issues that arise every day for the working designer or design student. Lead author, Ted Padova, is a well-known speaker, university instructor and service-bureau owner who’s become an expert using Adobe software over the past 16 years. Co-author Kelly L. Murdock has written over 20 books on Web design, graphics, and multimedia, and has been a co-author of the Illustrator Bible.</p></span></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><div><p><b>Import, manage and edit your photos expertly with Lightroom CC!</b></p><p>As more and more of us access and edit photos on many different devices--laptops, desktops, tablets, and phones--we increasingly expect a seamless experience, with our images and edits showing up on all our devices, immediately. To accommodate this shift, Adobe has released a new version of its Lightroom application, Lightroom CC, that is specifically designed for cloud interaction. Lightroom CC is streamlined and simplified, meant to appeal to those who want to do more than the basics with their photos, but who are intimidated by Lightroom Classic CC and Photoshop.</p><p>In <i>Take Control of Lightroom CC</i>, photography expert Jeff Carlson gives a thorough, but accessible, guide to the new Lightroom CC. He explains where it fits in the Lightroom ecosystem, then moves on to detail how to import, manage, and professionally edit your photos using Lightroom CC. For those who want to keep using Lightroom Classic CC, he also looks at how the two programs can work together.</p><p>With this book, you'll:</p><ul><li><b>Get the big picture:</b> See how Lightroom CC and Lightroom Classic (as well as Lightroom Mobile and Lightroom for Web) work together </li><li><b>Build your photo library:</b> Learn how to import photos from cameras, memory cards, and locations on your hard disk; automatically add mobile photos; and sync photos, taking advantage of Lightroom CC's cloud-focused features. </li><li><b>Organize your photos:</b> Organize your photo library with rating and tagging, find photos using Adobe Sensei, manage your storage options, and back up your library.</li><li><b>Edit your photos:</b> Get a handle on essential editing basics (like working in the Edit panel); use crop, straighten, rotate and flip to re-orient photos; adjust lighting, color, and appearance; and apply presets.</li><li><b>Share your photos:</b> Post images directly to your friends online in Facebook, export them to disk in order to share them elsewhere, or make an entire album public for people to view and, optionally, to download.</li><li><b>Work with Lightroom Classic CC:</b> Learn how to migrate a Classic catalog, or discover how to run both programs together. </li></ul></div></span>",

    "title": "Perspective Drawing in Adobe Illustrator CS5",
    "description": "<span><p> Adobe Illustrator CS5 brings to users a hitherto new\nparadigm of vector drawing - perspective or “3D-like”\ndrawing. The scores of questions asked by pre-release testers of\nIllustrator CS5 due to lack of acquaintance with the terminology of\nperspective motivated the authors—members of the Illustrator\ndevelopment team— to write this book. Perspective drawing is\na relatively specialized domain pursued by technical artists and\ndraftsmen while Illustrator caters to a wide array of professionals\nand hobbyists ranging from traditional graphic designers and\npackage designers to web and interactive designers. The\nauthors’ goal has been to bridge that gap. By explaining the\nconcepts of linear perspective, they have tried to make the entire\nbook self-contained as much as possible; however, basic exposure to\nthe previous versions of Adobe Illustrator is assumed.<br/>\n\t\t\t<br/></p><p>The book begins with describing the way\nperspective works in the real world. Then the perspective drawing\nfeatures in Illustrator CS5 are introduced, beginning with working\nin Perspective View, followed by lessons in drawing and creating\nand transforming shapes in perspective. More advanced topics like\nmoving objects in 3D and working with text and symbols are covered\nnext, and finally the authors walk the reader through the\nconstruction of a simple scene. A Glossary and Appendices (dealing\nwith scripting) round out the book.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p><strong>Scott Kelby, the world’s #1 best-selling photography technique books author, is here with a new concept in photography and flash books—one that’s designed from the ground up to get you straight to whatever it is you need to do with a flash right now, get your answer fast, and get you back to shooting with your flash.</strong><br/><br/>Thanks to inexpensive flashes that are compatible with all major camera manufacturers (such as Yongnuo), owning and using a flash is now easily within reach for nearly all shooters, whether you're a hobbyist or aspriring professional. Once you own a flash, though, you'll have a lot of questions about how to get it to create the light you need—questions about camera and flash settings, questions about direction, quality, and quantity of light. And in addition to knowing how to use your flash, you need to know which modifiers and triggers you might need, and you need to learn use them quickly.<br/><br/>That’s why this book was created: to quickly get you to the technique, the setting, or exactly the right thing you need to do right now to improve your work.<br/><br/>Here’s how it works: When you need to know how to do a particular thing, you turn to the chapter where it would be found, find the thing you need to do (it’s easy, each page covers just one single topic), and Scott tells you exactly how to do it just like he was sitting there beside you, using the same casual style as if he were telling a friend. That way, you get back to shooting fast.<br/><br/>This isn’t a book of theory, full of confusing jargon and complicated concepts. This is a book on which settings to use, and exactly how and when to use them. The whole book is written in Scott’s plain-English, down-to-earth style, which makes the experience more like the two of you are out together on a shoot.</p><p><strong>It’s time to fall truly head-over-heels in love with your flash, so you can start creating the type of images with your flash that you’ve always dreamed of, and this is the book that can take you there.</strong></p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p><b>ARE YOU READY FOR AN ELEMENTS BOOK THAT\nBREAKS ALL THE RULES?</b><br/><br/>\nThis book breaks new ground by doing something for digital\nphotographers that’s never been done before–it cuts\nthrough the bull and shows you exactly “how to do it.”\nIt’s not a bunch of theory; it doesn’t challenge you to\ncome up with your own settings or figure things out on your own.\nInstead, it does something that virtually no other Elements book\nhas ever done–it tells you flat-out which settings to use,\nwhen to use them, and why.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you’re looking for one of those\n“tell-me-everything-about-the-Unsharp-Mask-filter”\nbooks, this isn’t it. You can grab any other Elements book on\nthe shelf, because they all do that. Instead, this book gives you\nthe inside tips and tricks of the trade for organizing, correcting,\nediting, sharp¿ening, retouching, and printing your photos\nlike a pro. You’ll be absolutely amazed at how easy and\neffective these techniques are–once you know the\nsecrets.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>LEARN HOW THE PROS DO IT</b><br/>\nEach year Scott trains thousands of digital photographers and,\nalmost without exception, they have the same questions and face the\nsame problems–that’s exactly what he covers in this\nbook. You’ll learn:</p><p>· How to unlock the power of layers\n(you’ll be amazed at how easy it is!)</p><p>· How to use Camera Raw for processing\nnot only RAW photos, but JPEGs, TIFFs, and PSDs too! (And\nyou’ll learn why so many pros like it best–because\nit’s faster and easier)</p><p>· The sharpening techniques the pros\nreally use (there’s an entire chapter just on this!)</p><p>· How to deal with common digital\ncamera image problems, including brightening people in dark shadows\nand getting the best color possible</p><p>· The most requested photographic\nspecial effects, and much more!</p><p><br/><b>THE BOOK’S SECRET WEAPON</b><br/>\nAlthough Elements 15 offers some digital photography features that\nPhotoshop CC doesn’t offer, there are plenty of features that\nPhotoshop CC has that Elements 15 doesn’t (like channels,\nHDR, etc.). But in this book, you’ll learn some slick\nwork¿arounds, cheats, and fairly ingenious ways to replicate\nmany of those Photo¿shop features right within Elements. Plus,\nyou can download a bonus chapter on portrait retouching and all the\nimages used in the book, from the book’s companion\nwebpage.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince this book is designed for photographers, it doesn’t\nwaste your time talking about what a pixel is, how to frame a shot\nor set your exposure, etc., and there’s no talk about which\ncamera or printer to buy. It’s all Elements, step by step,\ncover to cover, in the only book of its kind, and you’re\ngonna love it!</p></span></span>",

Readers\nwill enjoy learning to create slow-motion effects with Time\nRemapping, and will get up to speed on Premiere's new editing\ntools. What's more, users can compress their finished video for\ndelivery to the latest handheld devices, such as mobile phones,\niPods, PSPs, smartphones, and more. Best of all, the book's\naccompanying DVD includes real footage that you can practice\non.<br/></p></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>ARE YOU READY FOR AN ELEMENTS BOOK THAT BREAKS ALL THE\nRULES?<br/><br/>\nThis book breaks new ground by doing something for digital\nphotographers that’s never been done before–it cuts\nthrough the bull and shows you exactly “how to do it.”\nIt’s not a bunch of theory; it doesn’t challenge you to\ncome up with your own settings or figure things out on your own.\nInstead, it does something that virtually no other Elements book\nhas ever done–it tells you flat-out which settings to use,\nwhen to use them, and why.<br/><br/>\nIf you’re looking for one of those\n“tell-me-everything-about-the-Unsharp-Mask-filter”\nbooks, this isn’t it. You can grab any other Elements book on\nthe shelf, because they all do that. Instead, this book gives you\nthe inside tips and tricks of the trade for organizing, correcting,\nediting, sharpening, retouching, and printing your photos like a\npro. You’ll be absolutely amazed at how easy and effective\nthese techniques are–once you know the secrets.<br/><br/>\nLEARN HOW THE PROS DO IT<br/>\nEach year we train thousands of digital photographers and, almost\nwithout exception, they have the same questions and face the same\nproblems–that’s exactly what we cover in this book.\nYou’ll learn:<br/><br/>\n    •    The real secrets of\nhow the pros retouch portraits<br/>\n    •    How to unlock the\npower of layers (you’ll be amazed at how easy it is!)<br/>\n    •    How to use Camera Raw\nfor processing not only RAW photos, but JPEGs,<br/>\n    •    TIFFs, and PSDs, too!\n(And you’ll learn why so many pros like it best–because\nit’s faster and easier)<br/>\n    •    The sharpening\ntechniques the pros really use (there’s an entire chapter\njust on this!)<br/>\n    •    How to deal with\ncommon digital camera image problems, including brightening people\nin dark shadows and getting the best color possible<br/>\n    •    The most requested\nphotographic special effects, and much more!<br/><br/>\nTHE BOOK’S SECRET WEAPON<br/>\nAlthough Elements 14 offers some digital photography features that\nPhotoshop CC doesn’t offer, there are plenty of features that\nPhotoshop CC has that Elements 14 still doesn’t have (things\nlike channels, HDR, etc.). But in this book, you’ll learn\nsome slick workarounds, cheats, and some fairly ingenious ways to\nreplicate many of those Photoshop features from right within\nElements. Plus, you can follow along with all the images used in\nthe book, available for download on the book’s companion\nwebpage.<br/><br/>\nSince this book is designed for photographers, it doesn’t\nwaste your time talking about what a pixel is, how to frame a shot,\nset your exposure, etc., and there’s no talk about which\ncamera or printer to buy. It’s all Elements, step by step,\ncover to cover, in the only book of its kind, and you’re\ngonna love it!</p></span></span>",

In addition, they will pick up vital\ntechniques for acquiring and perfecting source images in Photoshop\nCS4, before bringing them together as a seamless composite. The\npowerful new 3D features found in the Extended edition are also\ndiscussed as part of a 2D-3D workflow.<br/><br/>\nSerious photographers and digital artists wishing to produce\nphoto-realistic imagery or surrealistic artwork by\nblending—or compositing—multiple images and light\nsources can learn all they need to know right here. Building from\nthe reader's existing skill set of Photoshop fundamentals, the\nauthors provide detailed examples and explanations that cover the\nnewest features in Photoshop CS4 and also utilize a variety of\ntools and software applications.<br/><br/>\nMore than just a Photoshop guide, this book takes a holistic\napproach, instructing readers on photographic planning and\ntechniques, key design concepts, visual perception, and robust\nimage editing techniques. This is an increasingly popular approach\nwhich requires the digital artist to become more involved in the\npresentation and concept of their images. Real World Compositing\nwith Photoshop CS4 delivers the information readers need, to\nproduce the best possible composite imagery.<br/></p></span></span></span>",

Do you use Adobe Photoshop CS2 and have\nsome experience with scripting? You're in luck. Since Adobe\nCreative Suite 2 was created with built-in support for scripting,\nvirtually every repetitive or time-consuming task that creative\nprofessionals have to do in the Adobe Creative Suite can be\nstreamlined with the help of a script. This book describes how to\nuse JavaScript to manipulate and extend Adobe Photoshop within\nAdobe Creative Suite 2, and provides reference information for the\nJavaScript objects, properties, and functions defined by Adobe's\napplications. Now available in print for the first time, this\nscripting reference provides the information experienced JavaScript\nusers need to create custom scripts for Photoshop, whether you're\nlooking to automate Camera Raw options and settings, automatically\nresize and export large batches of images into your page-layout\napplication, or want to automatically add metadata, like a\ncopyright notice, to selected image files. These are just a few\nexamples of how you can use Photoshop CS2's built-in scripting\ncapabilities to save you from hours of repetitive tasks.</p></span></span>",

Every feature, from brushes to background, can be customised and optimised for artistic effect. With a little guidance from a pro, your photoshop results can go from competent retouching of images to visually stunning re-interpretations of them, turning everyday pictures into breathtaking works of art.<br id=\"CRLF\"/><br id=\"CRLF\"/>In this beautiful and inspiring book, acclaimed artist, author and lecturer Susan Bloom shows you how to do just that. Starting with the fundamentals: creating your own artistic brushes and textured papers virtually, she goes on to demonstrate how to create a variety of classic artistic styles in Photoshop, with chapters on watercolours, pastels, charcoal and oil. Further chapters cover illustration techniques in photoshop, and using third-party software to create painterly effects.<br id=\"CRLF\"/><br id=\"CRLF\"/>While the results are highly polished and realistic, this is not a book written specifically for artists. The techniques are aimed squarely at the Photoshop user looking to broaden their pallette, with emphasis on altering photographs to create artwork, rather than creating artwork from scratch. <br id=\"CRLF\"/><br id=\"CRLF\"/>Beautifully written, clearly laid out, and guaranteeing inspiring results, this book is a must-have for every Photoshop user.\n</span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p>Long established as a must-have guide for Photoshop users\nupgrading to the newest version, Up to Speed goes right to the\nheart of Photoshop CS4 what has changed, what is new, and how you\ncan get the most out of the features as quickly as possible. Rather\nthan sift through hundreds of pages detailing every last Photoshop\nfeature and function (both old and new), you can go directly to the\nnew features that interest you the most and get the explanations\nyou desire in the classic Ben Willmore style-- intuitive, crystal\nclear, and in-depth. By focusing on a single topic--what's new in\nthis version--the award-winning author provides precisely what\nexperienced Photoshop users have been clamoring for, in exactly the\ndepth they demand. After reading this book even if you've been\nusing CS4 for awhile don't be surprised to hear yourself say, I\ndidn't know CS4 did that! In addition to learning the new features\nin no time flat, a welcome side effect of learning from Ben is that\nyou can expect to become a better, faster and more efficient\nPhotoshop user, and few things are more fun than becoming better at\nPhotoshop!</p></span></span>",

Increasingly, photographers are turning to Adobe's acclaimed new Lightroom software to manage this part of the workflow.</p><p>After the best images are identified, photographers move to the second part of the workflow, the Creative Workflow, to fine-tune special images using a variety of advanced digital tools so that the creative vision is realized. An overwhelming majority of digital photographers use Photoshop for this advanced editing.</p><p><em>Adobe Photoshop Lightroom &amp; Photoshop Workflow Bible</em> effectively guides digital photographers through both parts of this process. Author Mark Fitzgerald, an Adobe Certified Expert and Adobe Certified Instructor in Photoshop CS3 offers readers a clear path to using both Lightroom 2 and Photoshop CS3 to create a complete digital workflow. Fitzgerald uses tips, tricks, and step-by-step directions to demonstrate how to integrate these two powerful programs to optimize image management and create stunning images.</p><p>The first part of this book is dedicated to offering an overview of the complete workflow, clearly defining the purpose of both Photoshop and Lightroom within a photographer's workflow and explaining the basics of image files and how to organize them.</p><p>The second part delves into using Lightroom to manage the Production Workflow.  It begins with an in-depth look at the Lightroom workspace and how images are imported into it. Photographers are then guided through organizing images within Lightroom, processing photos, sharing photos with others in a variety of formats and creating files to use outside of Lightroom. Finally, the workflow is put into action by demonstrating how a wildlife photographer used Lightroom in the field while photographing migrating polar bears in the arctic.</p><p>The third part focuses on Photoshop and the Creative Workflow, starting with opening files in Photoshop as well as suggesting when and how photographers should be utilizing Bridge and Adobe Camera Raw. A review of the Photoshop workspace is followed by information on adjusting tonality and color with a wide variety of tools, and working with layers.</p><p>Part four moves into more advanced Photoshop tools and techniques, such as selections, layer masks and using Photoshop's retouching tools. There is also a discussion on the nuances of using Photoshop and Lightroom together and how to use Photoshop actions in Lightroom.</p><p>Part five focuses on putting all of the pieces together to create the complete Creative Workflow with Photoshop. It begins with a discussion for creating strategies for success. The author then moves on to how to solve special portrait retouching problems and how to add creative finishing touches. Then Fitzgerald demonstrates the entire process with a downloadable practice file so you can follow along and practice your newly learned skills.</p></span></span></span></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Written in concert with Adobe's development of the Photoshop\nLightroom 2 Beta, The Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 2 Book for Digital\nPhotographers - by #1 bestselling computer and technology author,\nScott Kelby - is the most complete and concise Lightroom \"how-to\"\nbook for digital photographers of all skill levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn The Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 2 Book for Digital Photographers,\nScott walks readers through the basics of Lightroom use, leading\nthem to a brilliantly devised and super efficient digital\nphotography workflow that dramatically improves productivity and\nallows photographers to spend less time processing photos and more\ntime shooting them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThroughout the book Scott shares his personal camera and Lightroom\nsettings, as well as the studio-tested techniques he's developed\nfor his own photography workflow. The book is written in his\ntrademark step-by-step, plain English style, and because he knows\nwhat really works and what doesn't, he isn't shy to tell you flat\nout which tools to use, which to avoid, and why. This allows\ndigital photographers of any skill level to jump right in using\nLightroom like a pro from the very start, sidestepping a lot of the\nfrustrations that typically haunt those unfamiliar with new\napplications…especially those as powerful as Lightroom.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat really sets The Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 2 Book for Digital\nPhotographers apart from other Lightroom books on the market are\nthe last two bonus chapters where Scott answers the questions, \"In\nexactly what order am I supposed to do things in Lightoom,\" and\n\"Where does Photoshop fit in to the mix?\" Both chapters start with\nan on-location photo shoot, including full details on the\nequipment, camera settings, and lighting techniques. Readers then\nwitness as he takes the photos from each shoot through the entire\nworkflow process, to the final output of the 16\"x20\" prints. And,\nbecause he incorporates Photoshop seamlessly right into this\nworkflow, you'll learn some of the latest Photoshop techniques for\nportrait and landscape photography as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're one of those people who learns best by actually doing the\nprojects yourself; who learns best without all the complicated\ntechnical explanations and confusing jargon, and if you really want\nto start using Lightroom today to unlock the productivity secrets\nof \"The new digital photography workflow,\"---there is no faster,\nmore \"straight-to-the-point\" or more fun way to learn than this\ngroundbreaking new book, and you are absolutely going to love\nit! </p></span>",
