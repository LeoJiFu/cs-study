    "title": "The Bitcoin Standard",
    "description": "<span><p>When a pseudonymous programmer introduced “a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party” to a small online mailing list in 2008, very few paid attention. Ten years later, and against all odds, this upstart autonomous decentralized software offers an unstoppable and globally-accessible hard money alternative to modern central banks. The Bitcoin Standard analyzes the historical context to the rise of Bitcoin, the economic properties that have allowed it to grow quickly, and its likely economic, political, and social implications.</p><p>While Bitcoin is a new invention of the digital age, the problem it purports to solve is as old as human society itself: transferring value across time and space. Ammous takes the reader on an engaging journey through the history of technologies performing the functions of money, from primitive systems of trading limestones and seashells, to metals, coins, the gold standard, and modern government debt. Exploring what gave these technologies their monetary role, and how most lost it, provides the reader with a good idea of what makes for sound money, and sets the stage for an economic discussion of its consequences for individual and societal future-orientation, capital accumulation, trade, peace, culture, and art. Compellingly, Ammous shows that it is no coincidence that the loftiest achievements of humanity have come in societies enjoying the benefits of sound monetary regimes, nor is it coincidental that monetary collapse has usually accompanied civilizational collapse.</p><p>With this background in place, the book moves on to explain the operation of Bitcoin in a functional and intuitive way. Bitcoin is a decentralized, distributed piece of software that converts electricity and processing power into indisputably accurate records, thus allowing its users to utilize the Internet to perform the traditional functions of money without having to rely on, or trust, any authorities or infrastructure in the physical world. Bitcoin is thus best understood as the first successfully implemented form of digital cash and digital hard money. With an automated and perfectly predictable monetary policy, and the ability to perform final settlement of large sums across the world in a matter of minutes, Bitcoin’s real competitive edge might just be as a store of value and network for final settlement of large payments—a digital form of gold with a built-in settlement infrastructure.</p><p>Ammous’ firm grasp of the technological possibilities as well as the historical realities of monetary evolution provides for a fascinating exploration of the ramifications of voluntary free market money. As it challenges the most sacred of government monopolies, Bitcoin shifts the pendulum of sovereignty away from governments in favor of individuals, offering us the tantalizing possibility of a world where money is fully extricated from politics and unrestrained by borders.</p><p>The final chapter of the book explores some of the most common questions surrounding Bitcoin: Is Bitcoin mining a waste of energy? Is Bitcoin for criminals? Who controls Bitcoin, and can they change it if they please? How can Bitcoin be killed? And what to make of all the thousands of Bitcoin knock-offs, and the many supposed applications of Bitcoin’s ‘blockchain technology’? <i>The Bitcoin Standard</i> is the essential resource for a clear understanding of the rise of the Internet’s decentralized, apolitical, free-market alternative to national central banks.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><p><strong>9+ Hours of Video Instruction</strong><br/><br/>\n Developers need confidence when pushing new features to a new application or service in a distributed system. Contract testing is a technique that lets developers catch issues early at application build time. Thanks to such testing, you can apply the fail fast approach and break the build if there’s an issue, all in the hopes of easing continuous delivery and deployment. With the tips in this video, developers can learn to catch issues early, and avoid the need to run heavy and costly integration tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Description</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n This 9+ hour LiveLesson video course teaches developers how to apply the provider and consumer-driven contract testing approaches, for Spring and non-Spring based applications, with Spring Cloud Contract. There is coverage of JVM and non-JVM services, as Spring Cloud Contract can be used in a polyglot environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lessons cover building JVM and non-JVM applications, leveraging contract tests to drive the change of the API, as well as performing the provider and consumer-driven contract tests. In addition, developers learn how to use Spring Cloud Contract to verify whether current testing customs are correct, leverage Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner to automatically fetch and run stubs, and use Docker to generate and test non-JVM based applications.</p><p>The supporting code for this LiveLesson is located at <a href=\"http://www.informit.com/content/images/9780135598412/Downloads/9780135598412-master.zip\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.informit.com/store/hands-on-guide-to-spring-cloud-contract-livelessons-9780135598412</a>.</p><p><strong>About the Instructor</strong></p><p><strong>Marcin Grzejszczak</strong> is a software engineer at Pivotal.

    "title": "The Business Blockchain",
    "description": "<span><span><span><span><span><p><b>The definitive pioneering blueprint covering the what, why and how of the blockchain.</b> </p><p>Blockchains are new technology layers that rewire the Internet and threaten to side-step older legacy constructs and centrally served businesses. At its core, a blockchain injects trust into the network, cutting off some intermediaries from serving that function and creatively disrupting how they operate. Metaphorically, blockchains are the ultimate non-stop computers. Once launched, they never go down, and offer an incredible amount of resiliency, making them dependable and attractive for running a new generation of decentralized services and software applications. </p><p><i>The Business Blockchain</i> charts new territory in advancing our understanding of the blockchain by unpacking its elements like no other before. William Mougayar anticipates a future that consists of thousands, if not millions of blockchains that will enable not only frictionless value exchange, but also a new flow of value, redefining roles, relationships, power and governance. In this book, Mougayar makes two other strategic assertions. First, the blockchain has polymorphic characteristics; its application will result in a multiplicity of effects. Second, we shouldn’t ask ourselves what problems the blockchain solves, because that gives us a narrow view on its potential. Rather, we should imagine new opportunities, and tackle even more ambitious problems that cross organizational, regulatory and mental boundaries. </p><p>Drawing on 34 years of technology industry experience as an executive, analyst, consultant, entrepreneur, startup mentor, author, blogger, educator, thought leader and investor, William Mougayar describes a future that is influenced by fundamental shifts brought by blockchain technology as the catalyst for change. William Mougayar has been described as the most sophisticated blockchain business thinker. He is a blockchain industry insider whose work has already shaped and influenced the understanding of blockchain for people around the world, via his generous blogging and rigorous research insights. He is a direct participant in the crypto-technology market, working alongside startups, entrepreneurs, pioneers, leaders, innovators, creators, enterprise executives and practitioners; in addition to being an investor, advisor, and board member in some of the leading organizations in this space, such as the Ethereum Foundation, OpenBazaar and Coin Center.</p><p>Just as the Internet created new possibilities that we didn’t foresee in its early years, the blockchain will give rise to new business models and ideas that may still be invisible. Following an engaging Foreword by Vitalik Buterin, this book is organized along these 7 chapters:</p><p>1. What is the Blockchain?</p><p>2. How Blockchain Trust Infiltrates</p><p>3. Obstacles, Challenges &amp; Mental Blocks</p><p>4. Blockchain in Financial Services</p><p>5. Lighthouse Industries &amp; New Intermediaries</p><p>6. Implementing Blockchain Technology</p><p>7. Decentralization as the Way Forward</p><p><i>The Business Blockchain</i> is an invitation for technologists to better understand the business potential of the blockchain, and for business minded people to grasp the many facets of blockchain technology. This book teaches you how to think about the blockchain.</p></span></span></span></span></span>",

The trust, transparency, security, quality and reduced costs of blockchain make it a game-changing technology that crosses sectors, industries and borders with ease. Even though the technologies are ready for adoption, businesses remain largely unaware of their full potential and effective implementation. End users require accurate and up-to-date information on the practical applications of blockchain — <i>Commercializing Blockchain</i> provides it.</p><p>A practical and easy-to-understand guide to blockchain, this timely book illustrates how this revolutionary technology can be used to transform governments, businesses, enterprises and entire communities. The author draws from his experience with global retailers, global technology companies, UCL Centre for Blockchain technologies, the government of the UK, Retail Blockchain Consortium and many other sources to present real-world case studies on the use and benefits of blockchain. Topics include financial transactions, tokenisation, identity management, supply chain transparency, global shipping and freight, counterfeiting and more.

    "description": "<span><p>Learn about Solidity, smart contracts, Truffle, Ganache, Ethereum Blockchain programming, cryptocurrency, DApps, IPFS, and the Remix IDE</p><p><b>About This Video</b></p><ul><li>Learn the essentials of the Ethereum blockchain</li><li>Understand basic and advanced concepts of the Solidity language</li><li>Learn how to deploy your DApp using Heroku</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>For the past couple of years, there has been no bigger breakthrough in the IT world than Blockchain technology. The extremely fast growth of the industry, market, and the technology itself has led to an enormous shortage of programmers who truly understand the blockchain technology. Along with the latter, smart contracts have also emerged—and with them, Solidity.</p><p>The aim of this course is to give you the easiest and the best route to becoming a blockchain developer. We will be focusing on smart contract development with Solidity in the Ethereum ecosystem. You will learn to create your first smart contracts in the Ethereum blockchain—even if you are a complete beginner and know nothing about programming or Solidity. The author will show you how to create your first smart contracts with Remix, the online IDE, and we will go through all the features that Solidity gives us as a programming language. You will also be able to set up your environment to start coding with Solidity on your local machine. The author will show you what settings and configurations he used to set up VSCode and how to successfully install Truffle on Windows.</p><p>After that, he will teach you the basics of the Truffle Framework and how to make it work with Ganache as your own private Ethereum blockchain network. We will also test out our Solidity smart contract behavior by unit testing with Chai and Mocha. If you are a serious developer, you need to know that your code is working the way you expect it to. When you are finished, you will be able to create your own first decentralized application with Solidity and Truffle. While other courses are filled in with unnecessary information that makes them hard to navigate through and leave you confused, this course will take you step-by-step from a complete beginner to a master of Solidity and smart contract creation in the Ethereum ecosystem.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><b>From the cofounder of the longest-running Bitcoin exchange comes a compelling argument for how this digital currency will transform the global economy—and how it can work for you.</b><br/><br/>\nA financial revolution is materializing before our eyes. The way individuals, organizations, and governments conduct transactions—from purchasing a book online to acquiring major corporations to delivering billions in financial aid—will look vastly different in the near future. Bitcoin is spearheading this revolution and may be the best investment opportunity of our time, yet most people have yet to understand its promise.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this book, Bobby C. Lee, one of the earliest, most successful pioneers in the cryptocurrency space, debunks myths and dispels fears that surround Bitcoin, arguing that this rational, logical system is superior to traditional monetary systems. He cites signs of Bitcoin’s widening acceptance: a growing community of users worldwide and multiple initiatives for investing in and holding bitcoin among major financial services organizations and institutional investors who control trillions in assets.<br/>\n<br/>\nLee offers a primer on the best strategies for investing in this digital currency, the value of which will only continue to grow. He discusses the pros and cons, and covers the complicated yet more profitable method of acquiring bitcoin, mining. He offers predictions for the future, including price, trajectory, use, and participation in the larger economy—as well as developments in regulation, technology, business, and society.<br/>\n<br/>\nInvest in the promise of Bitcoin today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\n  </span>",

Libertarian technologists who believed bitcoin would be the foundation of a new world order saw the moment as an apotheosis. Everyone else saw a bubble. Everyone else was right, and the bubble burst. But bitcoin survived, and the battle for its soul rages on.</p><p><i>Kings of Crypto</i> drops us into the unfolding drama, tracing the rise, fall, and rebirth of cryptocurrency through the experiences of major players across the globe. We follow Silicon Valley entrepreneur Brian Armstrong and the turbulent rocket ride of his startup, Coinbase, as he tries to take bitcoin mainstream while fighting off hackers, thieves, and zealots. Author Jeff John Roberts keenly observes the world of virtual currencies and what happens when startups try to disrupt the world of high finance. Clear explanations of crypto technology are woven into an amazing landscape full of meme-fueled startup hijinks, hacking (so much hacking!), shady investors, government investigations, billionaire bros and their Lambos, and closed-door meetings with Jamie Dimon.</p><p>This is the surprising story of the origins of cryptocurrency and how it is changing money forever.</p></span>",

The crypto market has been more volatile in 2018 than it has ever been. We believe this trend will continue for at least the next 12‚Äî24 months. We take a look at the technology, failures, and concerns within the underlying protocols used to support cryptocurrencies. <br/>\n<br/>\n \n \n Lesson 9, \"Decentralized Banking\"<br/>\n This lesson examines the advantages of decentralized banking and why many retailers, consumers, and businesses are pushing for standardizing cryptocurrency. It also examines the potential impact on a society if a shift toward decentralized banking were to occur. <br/>\n<br/>\n \n \n Lesson 10, \"Innovation and the Future of Cryptocurrencies and Blockchains\"<br/>\n Prior to this lesson we have discussed blockchain, cryptocurrency, ICOs, and a few other technologies; however, we have not discussed the potential future of blockchain technology. In this lesson we examine the potential future of the technology and innovations that are on the horizon. <br/>\n<br/>\n \n \n Lesson 11, \"Applications and Innovations\"<br/>\n In this lesson we talk about the innovation and potential application of blockchain technology and discuss the possible direction of bitcoin and digital currencies. <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>About Pearson Video Training</strong><br/>\n Pearson publishes expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

Not just any hardware--imagine specifying the behavior of a complex parallel computer, sending it to a chip, and having it run on that chip--all without any manufacturing? With Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), you can design such a machine with your mouse and keyboard. When you deploy it to the FPGA, it immediately takes on the behavior that you defined. Want to create something that behaves like a display driver integrated circuit? How about a CPU with an instruction set you dreamed up? Or your very own Bitcoin miner You can do all this with FPGAs. </p><p>Because you're not writing programs--rather, you're designing a chip whose sole purpose is to do what you tell it--it's faster than anything you can do in code.

    "description": "<span><span><p><b><em>The Ultimate Guide to Bitcoin</em></b> covers all aspects\nof the Bitcoin phenomenon, explaining how virtual currency works,\nhow it differs from and compares to traditional currency, the\nhistory of Bitcoin, how to purchase and pay with bitcoins, where\nand how one can obtain and manage a Bitcoin wallet, how to become a\nBitcoin minor, and more. In addition, this book presents\ninformation about competing virtual currencies, and compares them\nto Bitcoin. Readers will also learn to judge the relative value and\nsafety of the Bitcoin currency, and determine whether the rewards\noutweigh the risks.</p><p>Bitcoin is the virtual currency of the Internet, a distributed,\nworldwide, decentralized digital money. It's the most popular of\nseveral current cryptocurrencies, devised in 2009 by programmer\nSatoshi Nakamoto.(Although that's probably not his real\nname...)</p><p>The unit of currency in the Bitcoin system is called a\n<em>bitcoin</em>, or BTC. A bitcoin is not a physical currency, such\nas a dollar bill or nickel, but rather just a number associated\nwith a Bitcoin Address. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin is\nnot issued from or managed by any central government bank or\norganization. With Bitcoin, users become their own banks –\nand assume all the risks inherent in that proposal. As such, the\nvalue of a bitcoin is not pegged to any traditional real-world\ncurrency. Over the currency's relatively short life, the dollar\nvalue of a bitcoin has fluctuated from 14 cents (actually, zero at\ninception) to more than $1,2000. (Today a bitcoin is worth\napproximately 800 US dollars.)</p><p>Bitcoin exists on a peer-to-peer network, much like BitTorrent.\nUsers on the P2P network, called <em>miners</em>, enable their PCs to\nbe used to host and manage bitcoin transactions. To use Bitcoin, a\nuser must sign up with an online wallet service, through which all\ntransactions are managed. This digital wallet is typically stored\non the P2P servers, with all transactions secured via public-key\nencryption. The public key is used to encode all payments, which\ncan then be retrieved only with the use of the user's private\nkey.</p><p>One can earn bitcoins by providing goods or services to other\nusers or by participating in the mining process. Users can also\npurchase bitcoins with traditional currency from one of several\nBitcoin Exchanges. Bitcoins can then be spent on other goods and\nservices available over the Internet.</p></span></span>",

However, Azure has created ML and AI services that are easy to implement in the cloud. Hands-On Machine Learning with Azure teaches you how to perform advanced ML projects in the cloud in a cost-effective way.\n</p><p>The book begins by covering the benefits of ML and AI in the cloud. You will then explore Microsoft's Team Data Science Process to establish a repeatable process for successful AI development and implementation. You will also gain an understanding of AI technologies available in Azure and the Cognitive Services APIs to integrate them into bot applications. This book lets you explore prebuilt templates with Azure Machine Learning Studio and build a model using canned algorithms that can be deployed as web services. The book then takes you through a preconfigured series of virtual machines in Azure targeted at AI development scenarios. You will get to grips with the ML Server and its capabilities in SQL and HDInsight. In the concluding chapters, you'll integrate patterns with other non-AI services in Azure.\n</p><p>By the end of this book, you will be fully equipped to implement smart cognitive actions in your models.\n</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Discover the benefits of leveraging the cloud for ML and AI\n</li><li>Use Cognitive Services APIs to build intelligent bots\n</li><li>Build a model using canned algorithms from Microsoft and deploy it as a web service\n</li><li>Deploy virtual machines in AI development scenarios\n</li><li>Apply R, Python, SQL Server, and Spark in Azure\n</li><li>Build and deploy deep learning solutions with CNTK, MMLSpark, and TensorFlow\n</li><li>Implement model retraining in IoT, Streaming, and Blockchain solutions\n</li><li>Explore best practices for integrating ML and AI functions with ADLA and logic apps\n</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>If you are a data scientist or developer familiar with Azure ML and cognitive services and want to create smart models and make sense of data in the cloud, this book is for you. You'll also find this book useful if you want to bring powerful machine learning services into your cloud applications. Some experience with data manipulation and processing, using languages like SQL, Python, and R, will aid in understanding the concepts covered in this book</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Deepen your understanding of blockchain technology and develop your own blockchain applications. This book provides a thorough review of distribution-based systems on blockchain technology, starting from the fundamental concepts that underlie it, all the way through the implementation of a blockchain network for business purposes. </p><p></p><p>Author <b>Joseph Thachil George</b> begins by introducing you to blockchain and some basic concepts of technology, including distributed systems, systems of systems, cyber-physical systems, the Byzantine Consensus, the CAP theorem, and cryptographic techniques. Next, he analyzes the structure of blocks and smart contracts and the mother of all blockchain platforms, Bitcoin. That sets the stage for an examination of transaction structure, validation, and flow, from creation to registration in the ledger and structure of the blocks, the Nakamoto consensus, and finally forks. From there, you’ll experience a deep dive into Ethereum; including the concepts of Gas and Message, smart contracts and the Ethereum virtual machine. From there, you’ll learn about the Ethereum consensus protocol, Ethereum Casper, and the Ethereum Proof-of-Stake algorithm. You’ll then see how blockchain can be connected to a distributed system, followed by a demonstration of how you can model a distributed system using Blockly4SoS and Kilobots. The concluding chapters offer a practical example that combines distributed systems with blockchain technology. </p><p>After reading this book, you will understand how to implement blockchain technology in a distributed system and be able to leverage this knowledge in your own projects. </p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><p></p><ul><li>Learn the concept of blockchains by way of a practical example  </li><li>Grasp the connection between distributed systems and blockchain technology</li><li>Learn the design of blockchain with hyperledger fabric</li><li>Learn the design of cyber-physical systems in a distributed environment </li></ul><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Who Is This Book For</b></p><p>Developers who are enthusiastic about the design and implementation of distributed systems.</p></span>",

    "title": "The Blockchain Alternative: Rethinking Macroeconomic Policy and Economic Theory",
    "description": "<span><p>Examine what would happen if we were to deploy blockchain technology at the sovereign level and use it to create a decentralized cashless economy. This book explains how finance and economics work today, and how the convergence of various technologies related to the financial sector can help us find solutions to problems, such as excessive debt creation, banks getting too big to fail, and shadow banking. <i>The Blockchain Alternative</i> offers sensible corrections to outdated and incorrect dogmas, such as the efficient markets hypothesis and rational expectations theory. You'll also be introduced to universal basic income, the consequences of going cashless, why complexity economics needs to be understood and what kinds of tools and theories you'll need to redefine the existing definition of capitalism.</p><p>While the book does discuss technologies and methods that are primed for our future, a number of references are made to economic history and the works of great thinkers from a different era. You'll see how the blockchain can be used to deploy solutions that were devised in the past, but which can serve as the antidote to our current economic malaises. You'll discover that what is required today is not an adaptation of the old theories, but a new methodology that is suited to this new era. Without undertaking such an endeavor, one will always be burdened with a definition of capitalism that is out of kilter with the evolution of our digital humanity.</p><p>What would this mean to monetary and fiscal policy, market structure and our current understanding of economics? More importantly would we need to change our current understanding of capitalism? And if we were to change our perceptions, what would the future version look like? This book answers these questions, and analyses some of the most pertinent issues of our generation.</p><p><b>What You'll Learn</b></p><ul><li><p>Examine fractional banking, debt, and the financialization of assets</p></li><li><p>Gain a firm understanding of the \"too big to fail\" theory, smart contracts, and Fintech</p></li><li><p>Review economics and agent-based modelling</p></li><li><p>Use the blockchain and complexity economics to rethink economics and capitalistic systems</p></li></ul><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>The primary audience is bankers and other finance professionals, policy makers, and students of finance and economics. The secondary audience is anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the current financial system, the blockchain, and the future of capitalism.</p></span>",

As businesses extend their reach globally, these hierarchical approaches no longer work. Instead, an enterprise’s entire data infrastructure—including multiple types of data persistence—needs to be shared and updated <em>everywhere at the same time</em> with fine-grained control over who has access.</p><p>This practical report examines the requirements and challenges of constructing a geo-distributed data platform, including examples of specific technologies designed to meet them. Authors Ted Dunning and Ellen Friedman also provide real-world use cases that show how low-latency geo-distribution of very large-scale data and computation provide a competitive edge.</p><p>With this report, you’ll explore:</p><ul><li>How replication and mirroring methods for data movement provide the large scale, low latency, and low cost that systems demand</li><li>The importance of multimaster replication of data streams and databases</li><li>Advantages (and disadvantages) of cloud neutrality, cloud bursting, and hybrid cloud architecture for transferring data</li><li>Why effective data governance is a complex process that requires the right tools for controlling and monitoring geo-distributed data</li><li>How to make containers work for geo-distributed data at scale, even where stateful applications are involved </li><li>Use cases that demonstrate how telecoms and online advertisers distribute large quantities of data</li></ul></div></span>",

Often they feel different, not right, less than. But as Marti Olsen Laney proves, that is far from the truth.The Introvert Advantage dispels common myths about introverts-they're not necessarily shy, aloof, or antisocial-and explains how they are hardwired from birth to focus inward, so outside stimulation such as chitchat, phone calls, parties, or office meetings can easily become &ldquo;too much.&rdquo; Most importantly, it thoroughly refutes many introverts' belief that something is wrong with them. Instead, it helps them recognize their inner strengths-their analytical skills, ability to think outside the box, and strong powers of concentration. It provides tools to improve relationships with partners, kids, colleagues, and friends, while offering dozens of tips, including 8 ways to showcase their abilities at work and strategies for socializing. In short, The Introvert Advantage shows introverts how to take advantage of their special qualities not only to survive in an extrovert-oriented world, but to thrive.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p></p><p></p><p>Technology is constantly evolving, and blockchain is taking development to new places, as mobile did a decade ago – and Ethereum is the leading platform for creating this new wave of applications. This book reveals everything you need to create a robust decentralized application (more commonly known as DApp). Unlike other books on the topic, this one focuses on the web application layer, and guides you in creating great experiences on top of the Ethereum blockchain. You’ll review the challenges and differences involved in developing DApps as opposed to traditional web applications. </p>After a brief introduction to blockchain history and Ethereum in particular, you’ll jump directly into building a sample decentralized application, to familiarize yourself with all the moving pieces. This book offers specific chapters on querying and rendering data from the blockchain, reacting to events, interacting with user accounts, sending transactions, managing gas, handling confirmations and reorganizations, and more. You will also find a chapter dedicated to Solidity that will give you the necessary means to understand and even build your own smart contracts. <p></p><p>Other important topics covered include building backend servers that act as indexing layers, and managing storage efficiently with solutions like the interplanetary file system, or IPFS. Last but not least, you will find chapters that examine the biggest problems on Ethereum today: onboarding and scalability.

    "description": "<span><p>Since Bitcoin appeared in 2009, the digital currency has been hailed as an Internet marvel and decried as the preferred transaction vehicle for all manner of criminals. It has left nearly everyone without a computer science degree confused: Just how do you \"mine\" money from ones and zeros?</p>\n\n<p>The answer lies in a technology called blockchain, which can be used for much more than Bitcoin. A general-purpose tool for creating secure, decentralized, peer-to-peer applications, blockchain technology has been compared to the Internet itself in both form and impact. Some have said this tool may change society as we know it. Blockchains are being used to create autonomous computer programs known as \"smart contracts,\" to expedite payments, to create financial instruments, to organize the exchange of data and information, and to facilitate interactions between humans and machines. The technology could affect governance itself, by supporting new organizational structures that promote more democratic and participatory decision making.</p>\n\n<p>Primavera De Filippi and Aaron Wright acknowledge this potential and urge the law to catch up. That is because disintermediation-a blockchain's greatest asset-subverts critical regulation. By cutting out middlemen, such as large online operators and multinational corporations, blockchains run the risk of undermining the capacity of governmental authorities to supervise activities in banking, commerce, law, and other vital areas. De Filippi and Wright welcome the new possibilities inherent in blockchains. But as Blockchain and the Law makes clear, the technology cannot be harnessed productively without new rules and new approaches to legal thinking.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><span><div><p>When it comes to digitally recording and storing valuable information, no other technology can match the strength of security of the blockchain. Blockchain’s distributed-ledger technology offers near immutable record keeping for transactions of all kinds, including legal contracts, property deeds, registrations, financial matters, birth certificates and other personal information, municipal archives, important business data, or any other types of activity for which inviolable records must be maintained. Of course, most people associate blockchain with cryptocurrency, but this fascinating technology is capable of much, much more. Ethereum represents the second-generation in the public blockchain, In addition to offering its own cryptocurrency (Ether) Ethereum’s second-generation architecture allows it to manage many other types of assets.</p><p>In this course, designed for participants who have a basic understanding of programming languages such as Java, Python, and JavaScript, and who know how to use web-based applications, your host, blockchain and Ethereum expert, Jim Sullivan, introduces you to the Ethereum network. You’ll learn how it works and examine ideas like blockchain consensus, the essential concept at the core of blockchain’s reliability and integrity. Jim also presents the tools you’ll use to manage your Ethereum environment. You’ll explore the differences between first- and second-generation blockchain technology and see how Ethereum nodes can run programming code called Smart Contracts, which you can set up to take actions on Ethereum transactions. In addition, Jim teaches you about designing and building Decentralized Applications or DApps, and much more. You’ll benefit from the hands-on approach of this video course, which includes use cases to reinforce what you learn and get you started on your way toward developing enterprise Blockchain applications using Ethereum.</p><p><b>What you’ll learn—and how you can apply it</b></p><ul><li>Understand the structure of the Ethereum Blockchain</li><li>Learn blockchain cryptography through hands-on exercises</li><li>Learn how to model and build DApps via step-by-step projects</li><li>How to design and build Ethereum Smart Contracts</li><li>Understand common Smart Contract patterns like access restriction and state machine</li><li>Understand how Ethereum manages assets such as cryptocurrencies, and other assets</li><li>Use your knowledge of Ethereum to solve real-life problems</li></ul><p><b>This course is for you because…</b></p><ul><li>You're a data administrator and want to learn how blockchain technology and Ethereum can safeguard your record keeping</li><li>You want to learn about cryptography algorithms and encryption techniques</li><li>You're a security engineer who wants to learn how to model and develop DApps</li><li>You want to pursue a career as a blockchain security specialist, blockchain Ethereum developer or blockchain hyperledger developer</li><li>You want to build subject matter expertise in the theory and use of Ethereum and other blockchain networks</li></ul><p><b>Prerequisites:</b></p><ul><li>Basic understanding of using blockchain</li></ul><p><b>Materials or downloads needed in advance:</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://myhsts.org/tutorial-history-and-evolution-of-blockchain-technology-from-bitcoin.php\" target=\"_blank\">History and Evolution of Blockchain Technology from Bitcoin</a></li></ul><p><b>Further Resources:</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://myhsts.org/tutorial-comprehensive-blockchain-ethereum-and-solidity-developer-guide-for-all-professional-programmers.php\" target=\"_blank\">Comprehensive Blockchain Ethereum Developer Guide from Beginner to Advance Level</a>: This article lists two series of tutorials for building two blockchain applications step by step in Ethereum using Solidity and Truffle.</li><li><a href=\"https://myhsts.org/tutorial-learn-about-ethereum-blockchain-development-with-dapps-and-ethereum-vm.php\" target=\"_blank\">Introduction to Ethereum Blockchain Development with DApps and Ethereum VM</a>: This tutorial shows you how to build DApps and run and test them via Ethereum Virtual Machine.</li><li><a href=\"https://blockchain.dcwebmakers.com/blockchain-as-a-service-apps-using-ethereum-and-quorum.html\" target=\"_blank\">Building Enterprise Blockchain-as-a-Service Applications Using Ethereum and Quorum</a>: This tutorial shows you how to build enterprise-level permissioned blockchain applications for Fintech and banks using Quorum and Ethereum.</li><li><a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/deploying-and-calling-ethereum-smart-contracts-on-hyperledger-burrow/\" target=\"_blank\">Deploying and Calling Ethereum Smart Contracts on Hyperledger Burrow</a>: This tutorial shows you step by step how to connect Ethereum blockchain applications with Hyperledger Fabric via Hyperledger Burrow.</li><li><a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/working-with-web3js-api-and-json-to-build-ethereum-blockchain-applications/\" target=\"_blank\">Working with web3js API and JSON to Build Ethereum Blockchain Applications</a>: This tutorial shows you how to exploit the Web3.JS API in Ethereum blockchain applications step-by-step.

    "description": "<span><p><b>Discover how blockchain will facilitate a new currency that will transcend space and time</b><b> </b></p><p>Largely inspired by <i>The Denationalization of Money</i> by Fredrich Hayek, <i>Money Without Boundaries’</i> ideological foundation is also inspired by economists and thought leaders like Milton Friedman and Irving Fisher, advancements in capital markets over the past 50 years, and the convergence of old and new technologies. Author Thomas J. Anderson explains how blockchain acts as the filter and the glue, making it all possible. </p><p>Compared with other currencies, blockchain-managed money markets are more straightforward and transparent. It is easier to monitor, understand, and assess the quality of their \"full-faith and credit.\" <i>Money Without Boundaries</i> shows how not only money, but also the process of borrowing and lending, will evolve to be conducted in a 100% trusted, secure, transparent, open architecture environment. Anderson begins with a history of money and discusses the rise of cryptocurrency, concluding with a comparison of decentralized money markets to all other alternatives. </p><p><i>Money without Boundaries:</i></p><p>• Demonstrates how blockchain technology allows full transparency</p><p>• Explains how blockchain makes it possible for money to be fully commoditized</p><p>• Explains how this fully market-based, decentralized, self-regulating system has vast implications throughout the global financial system</p><p>• Shows how everyone will benefit when they have the opportunity to compete on “full faith in credit”</p><p>If you are interested in cryptocurrency, money, monetary theory, or understanding how the applied uses of blockchain technology will change your everyday life, this is essential reading.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>A financial revolution is materializing before our eyes. The way individuals, organizations, and governments conduct transactions-from purchasing a book online to acquiring major corporations to delivering billions in financial aid-will look vastly different in the near future. Bitcoin is spearheading this revolution and may be the best investment opportunity of our time, yet most people have yet to understand its promise.</p>\n\n<p>In this book, Bobby C. Lee, one of the earliest pioneers in the cryptocurrency space, debunks myths and dispels fears that surround Bitcoin, arguing that this rational, logical system is superior to traditional monetary systems. He cites signs of Bitcoin's widening acceptance: a growing community of users worldwide and multiple initiatives for investing in and holding bitcoin among major financial services organizations and institutional investors who control trillions in assets.</p>\n\n<p>Lee offers a primer on the best strategies for investing in this digital currency, the value of which will only continue to grow. He discusses the pros and cons, and covers the complicated yet more profitable method of acquiring bitcoin, mining. He offers predictions for the future, including price, trajectory, use, and participation in the larger economy-as well as developments in regulation, technology, business, and society. </p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Bitcoin became a buzzword overnight. A cyber-enigma with an enthusiastic following, it pops up in headlines and fuels endless media debate. You can apparently use it to buy anything from coffee to cars, yet few people seem to truly understand what it is. This raises the question: Why should anyone care about bitcoin?</p>\n\n<p>In The Age of Cryptocurrency, Wall Street journalists Paul Vigna and Michael J. Casey deliver the definitive answer to this question. Cybermoney is poised to launch a revolution, one that could reinvent traditional financial and social structures while bringing the world's billions of \"unbanked\" individuals into a new global economy. Cryptocurrency holds the promise of a financial system without a middleman, one owned by the people who use it and one safeguarded from the devastation of a 2008-type crash.</p>\n\n<p>But bitcoin, the most famous of the cybermonies, carries a reputation for instability, wild fluctuation, and illicit business; some fear it has the power to eliminate jobs and to upend the concept of a nation-state. It implies, above all, monumental and wide-reaching change-for better and for worse. But it is here to stay, and you ignore it at your peril.</p>\n\n<p>Vigna and Casey demystify cryptocurrency-its origins, its function, and what you need to know to navigate a cyber-economy. The digital currency world will look very different from the paper currency world; The Age of Cryptocurrency will teach you how to be ready.</p></span>",

Until now, these strategies were the exclusive purview of institutions and the superwealthy, but today any informed investor can play the same game.</p><p>A rainbow of investment options—timber, start-ups, master limited partnerships (MLPs), hedged strategies, managed futures, infrastructure, peer-to-peer lending, farmland, and dozens of other nontraditional strategies—can provide dramatically better gains, with less total risk, than the standard choices. In <em>The Alternative Answer</em>, Bob Rice, Bloomberg TV's Alternative Investments Editor, leads an entertaining and easy- to-understand tour of this world, and suggests specific alternative investments for all four key \"jobs\" of a portfolio: safely generating more current income, decreasing risks of economic shocks, significantly increasing long-term profits, and protecting purchasing power over time.</p><p>Regardless of experience or net worth, readers will learn exactly how to substantially improve investment performance—in the same way that the world's best investors already do. Stocks and bonds alone aren't nearly enough. Investors need an alternative answer and now they have it.</p></span>",

Should I know their passwords for online accounts? Will they experience the value of personal connection without technology?\"</p>\n\n<p>To address her concerns, she outlined boundaries and expectations in a contract for her son to sign upon receiving his first cell phone. When Hofmann's editor at the Huffington Post posted the contract, now known as iRules, it resonated on a massive scale and went viral, resulting in a tsunami of media coverage and requests. It quickly became apparent that people across the country were hungry for more.</p>\n\n<p>In iRules, Hofmann provides families with the tools they need to find a balance between technology and human interaction through a philosophy she calls Slow Tech Parenting. In the book, she educates parents about the online culture tweens and teens enter the minute they go online, exploring issues like cyberbullying, friend fail, and sexting, as well as helping parents create their own iRules contracts to fit their families' needs. As funny as it is prescriptive, iRules will help parents figure out when to unplug and how to stay in sync with the changing world of technology, while teaching their children self-respect, integrity, and responsibility.</p></span>",

Revised and updated, <strong>The Physician Employment Contract Handbook, Second Edition: A Guide to Structuring Equitable</strong> <strong>Arrangements</strong> provides sample physician employment contracts and explains how each contract works. </p><p/><p>The new edition includes increased information on the latest managed care entities and a review of basic concepts in fraud and abuse, corporate practice of medicine, and antitrust concerns. The author discusses the various legal and compliance issues related to physician employment, such as anti-self referral and anti-kickback issues, and examines how to resolve disputes through arbitration or mediation. The author also outlines the pros and cons of various partnership arrangements. </p><p/><p>After you have finished this book, you will be able to ask meaningful questions of legal and accounting counsel, do a preliminary review and analysis of the agreement offered, and even compare a prospective employer’s contract to other standard agreements without endangering confidentiality agreements. You will be able to design standard text, saving time and money on legal fees by having counsel review and add the final touches to contract drafts instead of starting from scratch. With proper planning and a clear understanding of both short- and long-term objectives, you can move into the future and take advantage of opportunities in the current healthcare revolution.</p><p/></span>",

But in this hard-hitting, controversial exposé, Michael Edwards shows that business is ill-equipped to attack the causes of poverty, inequality, violence, and discrimination. Achieving fundamental social transformation requires cooperation rather than competition, collective action more than individual effort, and support for long-term, systemic solutions instead of immediate results. With a vested interest in the status quo, business can promise only limited advances: small change. It's time to turn away from the false promise of the market and reassert the independence of global citizen action.<br/>\n  </span>",

Pat McLagan draws on her thirty years of experience consulting on change projects worldwide to outline the beliefs, character traits, and actions that will enable anyone to welcome change and take advantage of it rather than fear and resist it.<br/><br/>Taking a conversational approach to a serious subject, she uses stories, examples, and illustrations to drive home the message that everybody in an organization has the power to make changes for the better. And she includes questionnaires throughout the book that enable readers to evaluate how ready they are to make the most of change.<br/><br/>Change is happening all around us, both planned and unplanned. How we react to change determines personal success and self-esteem, and ultimately the success of the entire organization. Change Is Everybody's Business will show readers precisely what they need to know to become more conscious participants in determining their own destiny at work-and in life.\n  </span>",

    "description": "<span>\n    PEOPLE IN ORGANIZATIONs of all types-public and private, large and small-have for years had to wrestle with the formidable challenge of successfully planning and implementing changes in how they do business. Today, the demand for faster approaches is increasing across a broad spectrum of organizations in business and society, as they are faced daily with an array of change mandates-new business strategy development and deployment, merger and acquisition integration, work re-design, community organizing, and more. Traditional command and control structures and processes no longer enable and mobilize people in organizations-the rapid rate of change in the environment demands new and different ways for organizations to respond.<br/>Whole-Scale Change: Unleashing the Magic in Organizations combines systems theory and practical methodology to offer a proven, flexible approach that leads to aligned action by hundreds, even thousands of people-and creates powerful processes for change. Shattering the old paradigm about how long it takes organizations to change, the book shows how to rapidly engage the whole system in meeting organizational agility and flexibility demands. It offers adaptable, repeatable strategies for different settings and convening issues through the authors' unique Whole-Scale approach-which has been successfully applied in diverse businesses and industries, the service sector, health care, education, government, other nonprofits, and communities throughout the world.<br/>Imagine everyone in your organization pulling in the same direction, everyone with the same information, acting quickly to solve the problems and confront the issues facing your organization. Whole-Scale Change provides not only the theories and principles underlying the approach, but also the practical methods, tools, and road maps for unleashing the energy and combining the power and wisdom of all the people in an organization.\n  </span>",

Worse still, the blockchain can even be used to hide information and covert messaging, unknown to most investigators.</p>\n\n<p>Investigating Cryptocurrencies is the first book to help corporate, law enforcement, and other investigators understand the technical concepts and the techniques for investigating crimes utilizing the blockchain and related digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Listen to this book to: understand blockchain and transaction technologies, set up and run cryptocurrency accounts, identify users of cryptocurrencies, and more.</p>\n\n<p>With nearly $150 billion in cryptocurrency circulating and $3 billion changing hands daily, crimes committed with or paid for with digital cash are a serious business. Luckily, Investigating Cryptocurrencies shows you how to detect it and, more importantly, stop it in its tracks.</p></span>",

Regulatory requirements to minimize systemic risk now encourage fair competition and transparency, transforming the “winner takes all” concept into a “co-opetition” environment. Now, companies must compete and collaborate to remain relevant in today’s digital economy. How exactly will this work? That’s where Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) come into play.</p><p>This report—a resource for business and tech professionals alike—examines the potential that DLT and blockchain have for transforming the banking industry. Jorge Lesmes, Global Head of everis Blockchain Banking Practice, examines how these technologies have moved from pilot projects to in-production applications that provide real value and benefits to end users. In three separate use cases, you’ll learn how DLT and blockchain can help bring about the “Internet of Value”—a secure method of sending and receiving value in the same way we transact data.</p><p>You’ll examine:</p><ul><li>How DLT platforms have the power to make the Internet of Value a reality</li><li>How DLT and blockchain are used in real production environments</li><li>The current challenges associated with DLT platform interconnectivity</li><li>Using DLT to enable self-sovereign digital identity management</li><li>Enabling interoperability among DLT platforms and traditional ledgers</li><li>Using DLT to enable streaming micropayments</li></ul></div></span>",

AI was the superstar topic of conversations at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland this past January 2019.

In this book, he opens the door to his journey of understanding and innovation, all in an effort to empower his readers to come up with business-relevant innovations of their own.<br/></p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Compile and run Bitcoin full nodes, lightning nodes, and user-friendly web-apps that help abstract the complexities of Bitcoin. This book not only explains the tools and techniques to help readers build their own banks and banking apps, but it also tells a story. Starting with the origins of Bitcoin—what it is and why we need it—find out what its strengths and limitations are. Understand the nature of mining and why so much energy is put into it.  The blockchain itself will be reviewed, as well, and compared to other options such as a normal SQL database or a simple spreadsheet.</p><p>With this book, you can control Bitcoin wallets via RPC commands on a Raspberry Pi. Configure, compile, and run two implementation of the Lightning Network-compatible daemons: LND and c-lightning. And employ user-friendly web apps that abstract the complexities of Bitcoin/Lightning-Network.</p><p>The Internet of Information is currently transitioning to the Internet of Things, which in turn may well  be followed by the Internet of Value (or Money). However, there is no evolution without happy users and Bitcoin will never reach the same heights like the original internet without having offered “useful” and “easy to use” tools. Just like nobody would ever want to use UUCP to send messages via web the same applies to current cryptocurrency tools. These are hard to use and very unforgiving. But, the evolution doesn’t stop here and many easy-to-use tools are already available. We will meet some of them when building apps for the Lightning Network, a new technology running on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain that makes it possible to generate billions of transactions within a single second.  </p><div><b>What You'll Learn</b><br/></div><div><ul><li>Control Bitcoin wallets via console RPC commands<br/></li><li>Run two implementation of the Lightning Network compatible daemons<br/></li><li>Simplify the complexities of Bitcoin and the Lightning network with user-friendly web apps<br/></li></ul></div><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b><br/></div><div>This book is for Makers familiar with the basics of Linux command line processes.</div></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Software Networks describe new concepts for the Internet's next generation. This architecture is based on virtual networking using Cloud and datacenter facilities. The main problems to be dealt with are the placement of virtual resources for opening a new network on the fly, and the urbanization of virtual resources implemented on physical network equipment. The digital architecture also deals with mechanisms capable of automatically controlling the placement of all virtual resources within the physical network.</p><p> </p><p>This book describes how to create and delete virtual networks on the fly. Indeed, the system is able to create any new network with any kind of virtual resource (e.g. switches, routers, LSRs, optical paths, firewalls, SIP-based servers, devices, servers, access points, etc.). Software Networks shows how this architecture is compatible with new advances in SDN (Software Defined Networking), new high-speed transport protocols such as TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) and LISP (Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol), NGN, IMS, new generation Wi-Fi, and 4G/5G networks. Finally, the author introduces Clouds of security and the virtualization of secure elements (smartcards) that could certainly transform how to secure the Internet.</p><p> </p><p>For this second edition, the author addresses in five new chapters the importance of open source software for networks, mobile edge computing, fog networking, tactile internet – a network environment allowing remote access, and security – the use of Cloud of security, secure elements and the emergence of the blockchain.</p><p/></span>",

    "title": "Why Trust Matters",
    "description": "<span><p>Have economists neglected trust? The economy is fundamentally a network of relationships built on mutual expectations. More than that, trust is the glue that holds civilization together. Every time we interact with another person-to make a purchase, work on a project, or share a living space-we rely on trust. Institutions and relationships function because people place confidence in them.</p>\n\n<p>Benjamin Ho reveals the surprising importance of trust to how we understand our day-to-day economic lives. Starting with the earliest societies and proceeding through the evolution of the modern economy, he explores its role across an astonishing range of institutions and practices. From contracts and banking to blockchain and the sharing economy to health care and climate change, Ho shows how trust shapes the workings of the world. He provides an accessible account of how economists have applied the mathematical tools of game theory and the experimental methods of behavioral economics to bring rigor to understanding trust. Bringing together insights from decades of research in an approachable format, Why Trust Matters shows how a concept that we rarely associate with the discipline of economics is central to the social systems that govern our lives.</p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>Sharing isn't new. Giving someone a ride, having a guest in your spare room, running errands for someone, participating in a supper club-these are not revolutionary concepts. What is new, in the \"sharing economy,\" is that you are not helping a friend for free; you are providing these services to a stranger for money. In this book, Arun Sundararajan, an expert on the sharing economy, explains the transition to what he describes as \"crowd-based capitalism\"-a new way of organizing economic activity that may supplant the traditional corporate-centered model. As peer-to-peer commercial exchange blurs the lines between the personal and the professional, how will the economy, government regulation, what it means to have a job, and our social fabric be affected?</p>\n\n<p>Drawing on extensive research and numerous real-world examples, Sundararajan explains the basics of crowd-based capitalism. He describes the intriguing mix of \"gift\" and \"market\" in its transactions, demystifies emerging blockchain technologies, and clarifies the dizzying array of emerging on-demand platforms. He then considers how this new paradigm changes economic growth and the future of work. </p></span>",

    "description": "<span><p>The IBM® mainframe remains a widely used enterprise computing workhorse, hosting essential IT for the majority of the world's top banks, airlines, insurers and more. As the mainframe continues to evolve, the newest IBM Z® servers offer solutions for AI and analytics, blockchain, cloud, DevOps, security and resiliency, with the aim of making the client experience similar to that of using cloud services.</p><p>Many organizations today face challenges with their core IT infrastructure:<br/></p><ul><br/><li>Complexity and stability<br/>An environment might have years of history and be seen as too complex to maintain or update. Problems with system stability can impact operations and be considered a high risk for the business.<br/></li><li>Workforce challenges<br/>Many data center teams are anticipating a skills shortage within the next 5 years due to a retiring and declining workforce specialized in the mainframe, not to mention the difficulty of attracting new talent. <br/></li><li>Total cost of ownership<br/>Some infrastructure solutions are seen as too expensive, and it's not always easy to balance up-front costs with the life expectancy and benefits of a given platform. <br/></li><li>Lack of speed and agility<br/>Older applications can be seen as too slow and monolithic as organizations face an increasing need for faster turnaround and release cycles. <br/></li></ul><br/>Some software vendors suggest addressing these challenges with the \"big bang\" approach of moving your entire environment to a public cloud. But public cloud isn't the best option for every workload, and a hybrid multicloud approach can offer the best of both worlds. IBM Z is constantly being developed to address the real challenges businesses face today, and every day we're helping clients modernize their IT environments. <br/>There are 4 strategic elements to consider when modernizing your mainframe environment:<br/><ul><br/><li>Infrastructure <br/></li><li>Applications <br/></li><li>Data access <br/></li><li>DevOps chain <br/></li></ul><br/>This paper focuses on these four modernization dimensions.\n\n  </span>",

Cryptography can provide you with this confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation. But are you aware of just what exactly is involved in using cryptographic techniques? Modern Cryptography for Cybersecurity Professionals helps you to gain a better understanding of the cryptographic elements necessary to secure your data.</p><p>The book begins by helping you to understand why we need to secure data and how encryption can provide protection, whether it be in motion or at rest. You'll then delve into symmetric and asymmetric encryption and discover how a hash is used. As you advance, you'll see how the public key infrastructure (PKI) and certificates build trust between parties, so that we can confidently encrypt and exchange data. Finally, you'll explore the practical applications of cryptographic techniques, including passwords, email, and blockchain technology, along with securely transmitting data using a virtual private network (VPN).</p><p>By the end of this cryptography book, you'll have gained a solid understanding of cryptographic techniques and terms, learned how symmetric and asymmetric encryption and hashed are used, and recognized the importance of key management and the PKI.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Understand how network attacks can compromise data</li><li>Review practical uses of cryptography over time</li><li>Compare how symmetric and asymmetric encryption work</li><li>Explore how a hash can ensure data integrity and authentication</li><li>Understand the laws that govern the need to secure data</li><li>Discover the practical applications of cryptographic techniques</li><li>Find out how the PKI enables trust</li><li>Get to grips with how data can be secured using a VPN</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book is for IT managers, security professionals, students, teachers, and anyone looking to learn more about cryptography and understand why it is important in an organization as part of an overall security framework. A basic understanding of encryption and general networking terms and concepts is needed to get the most out of this book.</p></span>",

    "title": "Demystifying Smart Cities: Practical Perspectives on How Cities Can Leverage the Potential of New Technologies",
    "description": "<span><p>The concept of Smart Cities is accurately regarded as a potentially transformative power all over the world. Bustling metropolises infused with the right combination of the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, big data, and blockchain promise to improve both our daily lives and larger structural operations at a city government level. The practical realities pose challenges that a significant sector of the tech industry now revolves around solving.</p><p>Cut through the hype with <i>Demystifying Smart Cities</i>. In this book, the real-world implementations of successful Smart City technology in places like New York, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, and more are analyzed, and insights are gained from recorded attempts in similar urban centers that have not reached their full Smart City potential. From the logistical complications of securing thousands of devices to collect millions of pieces of data daily, to the complicated governmental processes that are required to install Smart City tech, <i>Demystifying Smart Cities </i>covers every aspect of this revolutionary modern technology.</p><p>This book is the essential guide for anybody who touches a step of the Smart City process—from salespeople representing product vendors to city government officials to data scientists—and provides a more well-rounded understanding of the full positive and negative impacts of Smart City technology deployment. <i>Demystifying Smart Cities</i> evaluates how our cities can behave in a more intelligent way, and how producing novel solutions can pose equally novel challenges. The future of the metropolis is here, and the expert knowledge in the book is your greatest asset.</p><div><br/></div><div><b>What You'll Learn</b></div><div><div><ul><li>Practical issues and challenges of managing thousands and millions of IoT devices in a city<br/></li><li>The different types of city data and how to manage and secure it<br/></li><li>The possibilities of utilizing AI into a city (and how it differs from working with the private sector)<br/></li><li>Examples of how to make cities smarter with technology<br/></li></ul></div><div><br/></div><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><div>Primarily for those already familiar with the hype of smart city technologies but not the details of its implementation, along with technologists interested in learning how city government works when integrating technology. Also, people working for smart city vendors, especially sales people and product managers who need to understand their target market. </div><div><br/></div></div></div></span>",
